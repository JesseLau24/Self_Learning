[Scene: Barbados, Monica and Chandler's Room. They both enter from Ross's room. Monica still has her big, frizzy hair.]

Monica: Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...? (plays with her finger on Chandlers chest)

Chandler: You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.

Monica: I'll put a pillowcase over my head.

Chandler: You're on!

(they start to get ready, but then Phoebe enters through the door from Ross's room)

Phoebe: Hey!

Monica: What's up?

Phoebe: Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want...

(there's a door slamming in Ross's room, and some indistinct murmuring)

Ross: ... finally...

Phoebe: Is that Ross?

Monica: Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.

Phoebe: Sounds like he's with someone.

Chandler: He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.

Monica: Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.

(they all put their ear against the wall to be able to hear what's being said. We move to Ross's room where he and Charlie are kissing.)

Charlie: Ooh... Dr. Geller!

Ross: God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.

Monica: Oh my God, that's Charlie!

Chandler: She's cheating on Joey with Ross!

Phoebe: Oh that tart... floozy... giant...

Monica: I'm not sure about this.

Phoebe: Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.

Monica: No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!

Phoebe: Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.

Rachel: (through wall) Ooh... I love Barbados!

(Phoebe starts to listen at the other wall, where Rachel's room is. There, Joey and Rachel are kissing.)

Joey: Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!

Rachel: I know, I'm her!

(they start to kiss again, and Phoebe turns to Chandler and Monica)

Phoebe: (whispering) Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!

Monica: What?

Phoebe: Get over here!

(Chandler and Monica take a sprint to the other wall)

Rachel: ooh...

Chandler: Wow!

Monica: (in her Monica-excited-way... TOO LOUD!) Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!

(In the rooms next door, Joey, Rachel, Ross and Charlie stop kissing and try to understand what the yelling was about. After a while they continue kissing. We're back in Chandler and Monica's room. Monica has some of her own hair stuffed in her mouth by Chandler.)

Monica: (muffled) Thank you.

OPENING CREDITS

(Rachel and Joey's)

Rachel: Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?

Joey: Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...

Rachel: What? Ross and Charlie? (Joey nods) Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?

(Chandler and Monica's)

Monica: I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?

Chandler: How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!

Monica: I'm on it!

Chandler: Anything?

Monica: I think I hear curtains closing...

Phoebe: We've got shoes being kicked off over here.

Monica: Bedsprings, unmistakable!

Chandler: You do realise that's your brother?

Monica: Not until you said it. Somebody switch! (Chandler makes a clicking sound with his fingers and Phoebe runs to the other wall. Monica returns to Chandlers wall.) Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.

Chandler: That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.

Monica: Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.

Chandler: Okay Buckwheat!

Phoebe: You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free porn! (Chandler eagerly rushes over)

(Ross and Charlie's)

Ross: Weh...*sigh*

Charlie: uhm... Is everything okay?

Ross: Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...

Charlie: Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could just...

Ross: No, NO! (they're moving to the side of the bed, where they sit down) Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.

Charlie: I uhm... I completely understand.

Ross: Alright, I'm gonna go find them... (twitches a bit, looks down) I just need a... need a before I can... you know. (gestures standing up... they sit and wait for a while) Grandma... grandma... grandma... (he tries to concentrate...) Okay, I see you later.

Charlie: Okay...

(Chandler and Monica's, all three of them are listening at the wall to Ross and Charlie's)

Phoebe: That's the door. He's gone...

Chandler: And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!

Monica: Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!

(They are still listening at the wall, when Ross enters their room)

Ross: Hey, what are you guys doing?

Phoebe: Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. (hugs the wall) I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort and Spa... (she walks away from the wall)

Monica: (also hugs the wall) Yeah, we had a great time, thank you! (walks to Phoebe)

Chandler: (caresses the wall with his finger) Bye!

Ross: Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?

Chandler: He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... (walks to Phoebe and Monica)

Ross: Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?

Chandler: You got it!

Ross: Thanks! (walks out of the room and starts hugging the wall) Thank you! (closes the door)

Monica: Other wall, people! Other wall!

(they rush to the wall to Rachel and Joey's, and we move to that room)

Ross: (knocks on door) Rach, you there? (Joey and Rachel both get up from the bed)

Joey: Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?

Rachel: Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. (Joey like stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides, looking up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.) That's not nonchalant!

Joey: No idea what it means.

Rachel: Oh... okay, just hide!

Ross: (knocks) Rach?

Rachel: Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!

(When Rachel starts to look under the bed if Joey would fit under there, Chandler opens the door inbetween the rooms, grabs Joey by his shirt and drags him to his room, and closes the door again)

Rachel: There's no room under the bed. (looks around because she can't find Joey anymore)

Ross: Is everything okay?

Rachel: Yeah... (still looking to see where Joey went, and opens the door)

Ross: Hey.

Rachel: Hi...

Ross: You know where Joey is?

Rachel: ...I really don't... (looks around again)

Ross: Can I talk to you for a minute?

Rachel: Yeah, sure... (looks outside into the corridor if Joey is there)

(Monica and Chandler's room. Phoebe, Monica and Chandler have their ears pressed against the wall, and Joey looks at them)

Joey: I don't believe this... Have you guys been...

Phoebe: Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.

(Now Joey also wants to listen, and wants to press his ears against the door, which has a big mirror on it, he hesitates seeing himself in the mirror, but still puts his ear against it. We move again to Rachel's room.)

Ross: And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.

Rachel: (clearly not listening and still trying to find out where Joey went) Uh-huh... right... yeah...

Ross: And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.

Rachel: (still searching) Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.

Ross: Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?

Rachel: (now looking up at the ceiling) That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.

Ross: You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.

Rachel: You would think!

(Ross leaves the room)

Rachel: Joey!

Joey: Is he gone?

Rachel: (still can't find him) How are you doing this?

(Joey now enters the room through the door, Monica, Chandler and Phoebe are following him.)

Joey: Pssst...

Rachel: How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?

Monica, Chandler and Phoebe: YE-AH!

Phoebe: Now, what is this?

Rachel: Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!

Phoebe: Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?

Joey: Well, he's with Charlie now.

Monica: Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?

Joey: (long pause and he twitches a bit) You're a pain in my ass, Geller!

Rachel: All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...

Chandler: Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?

Rachel: Sure...

Chandler: Enunciate!

Rachel: Get out!

(They leave and Rachel locks the door.)

Rachel: Are they right?

Joey: Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.

Rachel: Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.

Joey: Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...

Rachel: (Joey walks to the door) Although...

Joey: (turns around very fast) I like although!

Rachel: I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...

Joey: Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...

Rachel: Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.

Joey: Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.

Rachel: No...

Joey: I'm thinking about you...

Rachel: Yeah...

Joey: Let's forget about Ross...

Rachel: Forgotten.

(They want to kiss, but just before their lips touch, Rachel pulls back quickly, gasping)

Joey: What's wrong?

Rachel: Nothing...

Joey's voice, but she sees Ross: Seriously... What is it?

Rachel: Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...

(again, just before their lips touch, she pulls back, gasping)

Joey's voice/Ross: What's wrong?

Rachel: Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...

Joey: Well, maybe I can help. (he grabs her head passionately, closes his eyes and kisses... Ross in Rachel's dress! He realises it too late, and when he does, pushes Ross's/Rachel's head away)

Rachel/Ross: Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again... (and she/he moves in for another kiss. Joey, pushes her head away again...)

Joey: Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...

Both: Yeah

COMMERCIAL BREAK

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's room. Chandler is packing when Ross knocks on the door and enters...]

Ross: Hey!

Chandler: Hey!

Ross: You guys ready to go?

Chandler: Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.

Ross: Dude! You're not taking your Bible?

Chandler: You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?

Ross: Learn about Jesus...

(Charlie now also enters the room, Chandler walks to the bathroom)

Ross: Hey!

Charlie: So, did you talk to Joey?

Ross: Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.

Charlie: Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!

Ross: Stop it!

Charlie: PHD

Ross: You're filthy!

(Phoebe enters)

Phoebe: Hey, have you guys seen Monica?

Ross: Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.

Phoebe: Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...

(Monica enters, with her hair braided and little shells at the end)

Monica: Check it out!

Phoebe: Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!

(Chandler enters from the bathroom)

Chandler: Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!

Monica: What do you think?

Chandler: I think.... I think I can see your scalp.

Monica: Don't you just love it?

Ross: Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.

Charlie: It's so... something... You go girlfriend!

Ross: You've never said that in your life, have you?

Charlie: Not once.

Ross: I thought so.

Monica: And listen to this... (shakes her body so the shells tingle)

Chandler: What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.

[Scene: Boarding the plane.]

Joey: Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.

Chandler: Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.

Joey: Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?

Ross: Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.

Joey: I understand...

Ross: No, I'll do it. (he quickly grabs Joey's boarding pass and gives Joey his one.)

Chandler: Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.

(Switch to Phoebe and Mike, who are kissing)

Phoebe: Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...

Mike: You should be careful when checking your overhead bins, 'cause items may shift during...

Phoebe: Aaah... you're not good at this...

Mike: You don't have to go home tonight, do you?

Phoebe: No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?

Mike: Oh...

Phoebe: What?

Mike: Uhm... I can't do anything tonight.

Phoebe: Why not?

Mike: I have a date.

Phoebe: You have a... You have a date? With who?

Mike: Oh, it's... my girlfriend.

Phoebe: (lets go of his hand) You have... have a girlfriend?

Mike: Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started seeing someone.

Phoebe: For how long?

Mike: Three months.

Phoebe: Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?

Mike: I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise.

Phoebe: Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.

Mike: Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material...

Phoebe: You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.

(cut to Charlie and Ross)

Ross: Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".

Charlie: Okay... Good luck.

(Ross gets up and gestures to Rachel, we cut to Joey and Rachel)

Rachel: Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.

Joey: I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.

Rachel: Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.

Joey: Ooh...

Rachel: Still nervous?

Joey: I'm gonna get the lasagna.

Ross: Hey Rach...

Rachel: Yeah!

Ross: Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?

Rachel: Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah! (mouths "Good luck" to Joey and gets up from her seat)

Ross: Hey!

Joey: Hey!

Ross: So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.

Joey: Yeah?

Ross: Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...

Joey: You kissed.

Ross: Wha... (gasps) What? What would give you that idea?

Joey: I saw you.

Ross: Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.

Joey: Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.

Ross: What?

Joey: It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.

Ross: Are you serious?

Joey: Yeah... Now I have something...

Ross: I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?

Joey: Oh... uh... look... before you...

Ross: No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...

Joey: I am those things, yeah.

Ross: You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...

Joey: Dude!

Ross: Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...

Joey: I can't think of anything.

(They both hug, and Rachel, who was in the back of the plane, sees this and smiles.)

Ross: Thanks!

Joey: Yeah.

(Ross walks to the back of the plane, where Rachel is.)

Rachel: So hi!

Ross: Hi!

Rachel: So you eh, you talked to Joey?

Ross: Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.

Rachel: Oh! That's great!

Ross: Yeah!

Rachel: Oh, so everything's okay?

Ross: Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.

Rachel: Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.

Ross: Well, I'm so excited about this.

Rachel: Really? Excited?

Ross: Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...

Rachel: Excuse me! (and she walks back to Joey, who is still looking very impressed about what Ross said to him. Rachel looks at him and hits him.) You didn't tell him, did you?

Joey: I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.

Rachel: Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.

Joey: Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.

(Chandler walks by and Joey lets out an evil "muhahaho".)

COMMERCIAL BREAK

[Scene: Mike's apartment. Phoebe's there and the phone rings.]

Phoebe: Hi, Mike's place.

Mike: Hey, it's Mike.

Phoebe: Ooh, that was fast.

Mike: Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...

Phoebe: Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.

Mike: One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.

Phoebe: Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?

Mike: Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.

Phoebe: Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. (laughs and hangs up the phone)

(there's knocking on the door which Phoebe opens)

Precious: Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?

Phoebe: (stunned) I... I'm Phoebe.

Precious: Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of his life? That Phoebe?

Phoebe: EnchantÃ© (she holds out her hand, and they shake hands)

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. Monica's carrying the laundry hamper to their coffee table.]

Monica: Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... (plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again) Ow!

Chandler: You go back to work tomorrow night, right?

Monica: Yeah!

Chandler: So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?

Monica: Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. (she pushes Chandler on the couch and brushes her hair and shells against Chandler's chest) You like that, right? (again, she brushes her hair against his chest and hums...)

Chandler: What are you singing?

Monica: It's "Bolero" from "10".

Chandler: It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from "Apocalypse Now"... See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!

Monica: You what? You said you liked them.

Chandler: Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.

Monica: Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.

Chandler: Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.

Monica: You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... (and she shakes her head more violently) OUCH!

Chandler: Hit yourself in the tooth?

Monica: And the eye!

[Scene: Ross's apartment.Someone's knocking on the door. Ross rushes to the door and it's Rachel with Emma.]

Ross: (gasps) Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. (kisses her) Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle? (to Rachel)

Rachel: That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.

Ross: Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.

Rachel: Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.

Ross: (unpacking his bag) Okay, shoot!

Rachel: Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.

Ross: (gasps) OH NO!

Rachel: What? What is it?

Ross: Oh, major shampoo explosion!

Rachel: Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.

Ross: Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me? (looks up)

Rachel: Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?

Ross: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?

Rachel: Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...

Ross: Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?

Rachel: Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.

Ross: Duh, you think? (enters the kitchen)

[Scene: Mike's place. Phoebe is on the phone.]

Phoebe: Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.

Precious: I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?

Phoebe: Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?

Precious: My name is Precious.

Phoebe: Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.

Precious: I just can't believe this... Why?

Phoebe: Well, I don't...

Precious: Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?

Phoebe: Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.

Precious: I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?

Phoebe: Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.

(Precious starts crying)

Phoebe: Okay, not a fan of the tough love.

Precious: I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning.

Phoebe: But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...

Precious: He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever. (she starts to cry again)

Phoebe: Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.

Precious: Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect.

(Mike enters the apartment.)

Precious: Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell.

(she slaps him in the face, Mike looks like he doesn't believe what just happened. Precious leaves, and he turns to Phoebe.)

Phoebe: You're welcome!

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's. Only Chandler is in the living room and walks to the bathroom.]

Chandler: Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?

Monica: Not really.

(Chandler enters the bathroom, and Monica is standing there in a towel, with her hair stuck in the shower curtain.)

Monica: I have a problem.

Chandler: Really? What happened?

Monica: Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman, No Cry" and I got stuck.

Chandler: You can't move at all?

Monica: Oh, well, I can move... (she moves back and forth the shower curtain rail, opening and closing the shower curtain with her hair as she goes)

Chandler: If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?

Monica: (looking disappointed) I guess so...

Chandler: (trying to untangle her) Some of these look a little frayed.

Monica: Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.

[Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment. Joey enters.]

Joey: Hey!

Rachel: Hi!

Joey: So, did you err... did you tell Ross?

Rachel: Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.

Joey: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory. (he pushes his breasts together from the side)

Rachel: Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.

Joey: Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.

Rachel: Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...

Joey: I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.

Rachel: No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?

Joey: Yeah! Good night! (they give each other a small kiss on the mouth, and stare at each other for a while)

Rachel: Goo--ood night!

Joey: Good night! (they give each other a kiss again, but this time it lasts longer)

Rachel: Seriously, good night!

Joey: Stop saying good night.

Rachel: Okay.

(Now they kiss passionately... and then Ross enters with Emma. They freeze, pull away and look at Ross who looks like he just can't believe what he's seeing. Joey straightens his shirt, and Rachel says I'm so-oo sorry, and presses her breasts together, just like Joey did before.)

COMMERCIAL BREAK

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's. Monica walks in with one of those knitted Rasta hats.]

Monica: Look what I found in the drawer... (Chandler looks up from his book.) And you said I'd never wear this...

Chandler: Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?

Monica: Sure, what do you have in mind?

Chandler: I think you know.

Monica: Really? I don't really feel like it.

Chandler: This is what I want to do.

Monica: Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.

Chandler: (Picks up the "Miss Congeniality" DVD) She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.

THE END
[Scene: Barbados, Monica and Chandler's Room. They both enter from Ross's room. Monica still has her big, frizzy hair.]

Monica: Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...? (plays with her finger on Chandlers chest)

Chandler: You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.

Monica: I'll put a pillowcase over my head.

Chandler: You're on!

(they start to get ready, but then Phoebe enters through the door from Ross's room)

Phoebe: Hey!

Monica: What's up?

Phoebe: Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want...

(there's a door slamming in Ross's room, and some indistinct murmuring)

Ross: ... finally...

Phoebe: Is that Ross?

Monica: Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.

Phoebe: Sounds like he's with someone.

Chandler: He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.

Monica: Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.

(they all put their ear against the wall to be able to hear what's being said. We move to Ross's room where he and Charlie are kissing.)

Charlie: Ooh... Dr. Geller!

Ross: God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.

Monica: Oh my God, that's Charlie!

Chandler: She's cheating on Joey with Ross!

Phoebe: Oh that tart... floozy... giant...

Monica: I'm not sure about this.

Phoebe: Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.

Monica: No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!

Phoebe: Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.

Rachel: (through wall) Ooh... I love Barbados!

(Phoebe starts to listen at the other wall, where Rachel's room is. There, Joey and Rachel are kissing.)

Joey: Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!

Rachel: I know, I'm her!

(they start to kiss again, and Phoebe turns to Chandler and Monica)

Phoebe: (whispering) Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!

Monica: What?

Phoebe: Get over here!

(Chandler and Monica take a sprint to the other wall)

Rachel: ooh...

Chandler: Wow!

Monica: (in her Monica-excited-way... TOO LOUD!) Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!

(In the rooms next door, Joey, Rachel, Ross and Charlie stop kissing and try to understand what the yelling was about. After a while they continue kissing. We're back in Chandler and Monica's room. Monica has some of her own hair stuffed in her mouth by Chandler.)

Monica: (muffled) Thank you.

OPENING CREDITS

(Rachel and Joey's)

Rachel: Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?

Joey: Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...

Rachel: What? Ross and Charlie? (Joey nods) Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?

(Chandler and Monica's)

Monica: I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?

Chandler: How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!

Monica: I'm on it!

Chandler: Anything?

Monica: I think I hear curtains closing...

Phoebe: We've got shoes being kicked off over here.

Monica: Bedsprings, unmistakable!

Chandler: You do realise that's your brother?

Monica: Not until you said it. Somebody switch! (Chandler makes a clicking sound with his fingers and Phoebe runs to the other wall. Monica returns to Chandlers wall.) Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.

Chandler: That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.

Monica: Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.

Chandler: Okay Buckwheat!

Phoebe: You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free porn! (Chandler eagerly rushes over)

(Ross and Charlie's)

Ross: Weh...*sigh*

Charlie: uhm... Is everything okay?

Ross: Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...

Charlie: Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could just...

Ross: No, NO! (they're moving to the side of the bed, where they sit down) Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.

Charlie: I uhm... I completely understand.

Ross: Alright, I'm gonna go find them... (twitches a bit, looks down) I just need a... need a before I can... you know. (gestures standing up... they sit and wait for a while) Grandma... grandma... grandma... (he tries to concentrate...) Okay, I see you later.

Charlie: Okay...

(Chandler and Monica's, all three of them are listening at the wall to Ross and Charlie's)

Phoebe: That's the door. He's gone...

Chandler: And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!

Monica: Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!

(They are still listening at the wall, when Ross enters their room)

Ross: Hey, what are you guys doing?

Phoebe: Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. (hugs the wall) I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort and Spa... (she walks away from the wall)

Monica: (also hugs the wall) Yeah, we had a great time, thank you! (walks to Phoebe)

Chandler: (caresses the wall with his finger) Bye!

Ross: Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?

Chandler: He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... (walks to Phoebe and Monica)

Ross: Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?

Chandler: You got it!

Ross: Thanks! (walks out of the room and starts hugging the wall) Thank you! (closes the door)

Monica: Other wall, people! Other wall!

(they rush to the wall to Rachel and Joey's, and we move to that room)

Ross: (knocks on door) Rach, you there? (Joey and Rachel both get up from the bed)

Joey: Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?

Rachel: Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. (Joey like stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides, looking up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.) That's not nonchalant!

Joey: No idea what it means.

Rachel: Oh... okay, just hide!

Ross: (knocks) Rach?

Rachel: Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!

(When Rachel starts to look under the bed if Joey would fit under there, Chandler opens the door inbetween the rooms, grabs Joey by his shirt and drags him to his room, and closes the door again)

Rachel: There's no room under the bed. (looks around because she can't find Joey anymore)

Ross: Is everything okay?

Rachel: Yeah... (still looking to see where Joey went, and opens the door)

Ross: Hey.

Rachel: Hi...

Ross: You know where Joey is?

Rachel: ...I really don't... (looks around again)

Ross: Can I talk to you for a minute?

Rachel: Yeah, sure... (looks outside into the corridor if Joey is there)

(Monica and Chandler's room. Phoebe, Monica and Chandler have their ears pressed against the wall, and Joey looks at them)

Joey: I don't believe this... Have you guys been...

Phoebe: Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.

(Now Joey also wants to listen, and wants to press his ears against the door, which has a big mirror on it, he hesitates seeing himself in the mirror, but still puts his ear against it. We move again to Rachel's room.)

Ross: And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.

Rachel: (clearly not listening and still trying to find out where Joey went) Uh-huh... right... yeah...

Ross: And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.

Rachel: (still searching) Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.

Ross: Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?

Rachel: (now looking up at the ceiling) That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.

Ross: You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.

Rachel: You would think!

(Ross leaves the room)

Rachel: Joey!

Joey: Is he gone?

Rachel: (still can't find him) How are you doing this?

(Joey now enters the room through the door, Monica, Chandler and Phoebe are following him.)

Joey: Pssst...

Rachel: How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?

Monica, Chandler and Phoebe: YE-AH!

Phoebe: Now, what is this?

Rachel: Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!

Phoebe: Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?

Joey: Well, he's with Charlie now.

Monica: Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?

Joey: (long pause and he twitches a bit) You're a pain in my ass, Geller!

Rachel: All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...

Chandler: Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?

Rachel: Sure...

Chandler: Enunciate!

Rachel: Get out!

(They leave and Rachel locks the door.)

Rachel: Are they right?

Joey: Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.

Rachel: Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.

Joey: Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...

Rachel: (Joey walks to the door) Although...

Joey: (turns around very fast) I like although!

Rachel: I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...

Joey: Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...

Rachel: Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.

Joey: Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.

Rachel: No...

Joey: I'm thinking about you...

Rachel: Yeah...

Joey: Let's forget about Ross...

Rachel: Forgotten.

(They want to kiss, but just before their lips touch, Rachel pulls back quickly, gasping)

Joey: What's wrong?

Rachel: Nothing...

Joey's voice, but she sees Ross: Seriously... What is it?

Rachel: Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...

(again, just before their lips touch, she pulls back, gasping)

Joey's voice/Ross: What's wrong?

Rachel: Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...

Joey: Well, maybe I can help. (he grabs her head passionately, closes his eyes and kisses... Ross in Rachel's dress! He realises it too late, and when he does, pushes Ross's/Rachel's head away)

Rachel/Ross: Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again... (and she/he moves in for another kiss. Joey, pushes her head away again...)

Joey: Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...

Both: Yeah

COMMERCIAL BREAK

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's room. Chandler is packing when Ross knocks on the door and enters...]

Ross: Hey!

Chandler: Hey!

Ross: You guys ready to go?

Chandler: Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.

Ross: Dude! You're not taking your Bible?

Chandler: You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?

Ross: Learn about Jesus...

(Charlie now also enters the room, Chandler walks to the bathroom)

Ross: Hey!

Charlie: So, did you talk to Joey?

Ross: Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.

Charlie: Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!

Ross: Stop it!

Charlie: PHD

Ross: You're filthy!

(Phoebe enters)

Phoebe: Hey, have you guys seen Monica?

Ross: Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.

Phoebe: Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...

(Monica enters, with her hair braided and little shells at the end)

Monica: Check it out!

Phoebe: Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!

(Chandler enters from the bathroom)

Chandler: Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!

Monica: What do you think?

Chandler: I think.... I think I can see your scalp.

Monica: Don't you just love it?

Ross: Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.

Charlie: It's so... something... You go girlfriend!

Ross: You've never said that in your life, have you?

Charlie: Not once.

Ross: I thought so.

Monica: And listen to this... (shakes her body so the shells tingle)

Chandler: What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.

[Scene: Boarding the plane.]

Joey: Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.

Chandler: Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.

Joey: Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?

Ross: Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.

Joey: I understand...

Ross: No, I'll do it. (he quickly grabs Joey's boarding pass and gives Joey his one.)

Chandler: Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.

(Switch to Phoebe and Mike, who are kissing)

Phoebe: Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...

Mike: You should be careful when checking your overhead bins, 'cause items may shift during...

Phoebe: Aaah... you're not good at this...

Mike: You don't have to go home tonight, do you?

Phoebe: No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?

Mike: Oh...

Phoebe: What?

Mike: Uhm... I can't do anything tonight.

Phoebe: Why not?

Mike: I have a date.

Phoebe: You have a... You have a date? With who?

Mike: Oh, it's... my girlfriend.

Phoebe: (lets go of his hand) You have... have a girlfriend?

Mike: Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started seeing someone.

Phoebe: For how long?

Mike: Three months.

Phoebe: Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?

Mike: I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise.

Phoebe: Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.

Mike: Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material...

Phoebe: You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.

(cut to Charlie and Ross)

Ross: Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".

Charlie: Okay... Good luck.

(Ross gets up and gestures to Rachel, we cut to Joey and Rachel)

Rachel: Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.

Joey: I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.

Rachel: Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.

Joey: Ooh...

Rachel: Still nervous?

Joey: I'm gonna get the lasagna.

Ross: Hey Rach...

Rachel: Yeah!

Ross: Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?

Rachel: Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah! (mouths "Good luck" to Joey and gets up from her seat)

Ross: Hey!

Joey: Hey!

Ross: So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.

Joey: Yeah?

Ross: Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...

Joey: You kissed.

Ross: Wha... (gasps) What? What would give you that idea?

Joey: I saw you.

Ross: Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.

Joey: Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.

Ross: What?

Joey: It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.

Ross: Are you serious?

Joey: Yeah... Now I have something...

Ross: I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?

Joey: Oh... uh... look... before you...

Ross: No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...

Joey: I am those things, yeah.

Ross: You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...

Joey: Dude!

Ross: Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...

Joey: I can't think of anything.

(They both hug, and Rachel, who was in the back of the plane, sees this and smiles.)

Ross: Thanks!

Joey: Yeah.

(Ross walks to the back of the plane, where Rachel is.)

Rachel: So hi!

Ross: Hi!

Rachel: So you eh, you talked to Joey?

Ross: Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.

Rachel: Oh! That's great!

Ross: Yeah!

Rachel: Oh, so everything's okay?

Ross: Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.

Rachel: Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.

Ross: Well, I'm so excited about this.

Rachel: Really? Excited?

Ross: Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...

Rachel: Excuse me! (and she walks back to Joey, who is still looking very impressed about what Ross said to him. Rachel looks at him and hits him.) You didn't tell him, did you?

Joey: I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.

Rachel: Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.

Joey: Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.

(Chandler walks by and Joey lets out an evil "muhahaho".)

COMMERCIAL BREAK

[Scene: Mike's apartment. Phoebe's there and the phone rings.]

Phoebe: Hi, Mike's place.

Mike: Hey, it's Mike.

Phoebe: Ooh, that was fast.

Mike: Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...

Phoebe: Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.

Mike: One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.

Phoebe: Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?

Mike: Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.

Phoebe: Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. (laughs and hangs up the phone)

(there's knocking on the door which Phoebe opens)

Precious: Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?

Phoebe: (stunned) I... I'm Phoebe.

Precious: Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of his life? That Phoebe?

Phoebe: EnchantÃ© (she holds out her hand, and they shake hands)

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. Monica's carrying the laundry hamper to their coffee table.]

Monica: Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... (plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again) Ow!

Chandler: You go back to work tomorrow night, right?

Monica: Yeah!

Chandler: So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?

Monica: Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. (she pushes Chandler on the couch and brushes her hair and shells against Chandler's chest) You like that, right? (again, she brushes her hair against his chest and hums...)

Chandler: What are you singing?

Monica: It's "Bolero" from "10".

Chandler: It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from "Apocalypse Now"... See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!

Monica: You what? You said you liked them.

Chandler: Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.

Monica: Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.

Chandler: Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.

Monica: You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... (and she shakes her head more violently) OUCH!

Chandler: Hit yourself in the tooth?

Monica: And the eye!

[Scene: Ross's apartment.Someone's knocking on the door. Ross rushes to the door and it's Rachel with Emma.]

Ross: (gasps) Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. (kisses her) Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle? (to Rachel)

Rachel: That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.

Ross: Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.

Rachel: Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.

Ross: (unpacking his bag) Okay, shoot!

Rachel: Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.

Ross: (gasps) OH NO!

Rachel: What? What is it?

Ross: Oh, major shampoo explosion!

Rachel: Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.

Ross: Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me? (looks up)

Rachel: Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?

Ross: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?

Rachel: Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...

Ross: Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?

Rachel: Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.

Ross: Duh, you think? (enters the kitchen)

[Scene: Mike's place. Phoebe is on the phone.]

Phoebe: Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.

Precious: I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?

Phoebe: Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?

Precious: My name is Precious.

Phoebe: Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.

Precious: I just can't believe this... Why?

Phoebe: Well, I don't...

Precious: Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?

Phoebe: Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.

Precious: I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?

Phoebe: Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.

(Precious starts crying)

Phoebe: Okay, not a fan of the tough love.

Precious: I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning.

Phoebe: But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...

Precious: He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever. (she starts to cry again)

Phoebe: Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.

Precious: Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect.

(Mike enters the apartment.)

Precious: Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell.

(she slaps him in the face, Mike looks like he doesn't believe what just happened. Precious leaves, and he turns to Phoebe.)

Phoebe: You're welcome!

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's. Only Chandler is in the living room and walks to the bathroom.]

Chandler: Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?

Monica: Not really.

(Chandler enters the bathroom, and Monica is standing there in a towel, with her hair stuck in the shower curtain.)

Monica: I have a problem.

Chandler: Really? What happened?

Monica: Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman, No Cry" and I got stuck.

Chandler: You can't move at all?

Monica: Oh, well, I can move... (she moves back and forth the shower curtain rail, opening and closing the shower curtain with her hair as she goes)

Chandler: If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?

Monica: (looking disappointed) I guess so...

Chandler: (trying to untangle her) Some of these look a little frayed.

Monica: Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.

[Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment. Joey enters.]

Joey: Hey!

Rachel: Hi!

Joey: So, did you err... did you tell Ross?

Rachel: Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.

Joey: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory. (he pushes his breasts together from the side)

Rachel: Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.

Joey: Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.

Rachel: Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...

Joey: I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.

Rachel: No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?

Joey: Yeah! Good night! (they give each other a small kiss on the mouth, and stare at each other for a while)

Rachel: Goo--ood night!

Joey: Good night! (they give each other a kiss again, but this time it lasts longer)

Rachel: Seriously, good night!

Joey: Stop saying good night.

Rachel: Okay.

(Now they kiss passionately... and then Ross enters with Emma. They freeze, pull away and look at Ross who looks like he just can't believe what he's seeing. Joey straightens his shirt, and Rachel says I'm so-oo sorry, and presses her breasts together, just like Joey did before.)

COMMERCIAL BREAK

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's. Monica walks in with one of those knitted Rasta hats.]

Monica: Look what I found in the drawer... (Chandler looks up from his book.) And you said I'd never wear this...

Chandler: Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?

Monica: Sure, what do you have in mind?

Chandler: I think you know.

Monica: Really? I don't really feel like it.

Chandler: This is what I want to do.

Monica: Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.

Chandler: (Picks up the "Miss Congeniality" DVD) She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.

THE END
[Scene: Barbados, Monica and Chandler's Room. They both enter from Ross's room. Monica still has her big, frizzy hair.]

Monica: Oh, the way you crushed Mike at ping pong was such a turn-on.You wanna...? (plays with her finger on Chandlers chest)

Chandler: You know, I'd love to, but I'm a little tired.

Monica: I'll put a pillowcase over my head.

Chandler: You're on!

(they start to get ready, but then Phoebe enters through the door from Ross's room)

Phoebe: Hey!

Monica: What's up?

Phoebe: Well, okay, Mike's taking a shower, which by the way there's no law against. And then we're gonna grab some food, so if you want...

(there's a door slamming in Ross's room, and some indistinct murmuring)

Ross: ... finally...

Phoebe: Is that Ross?

Monica: Yeah, you can hear everything through these stupid walls.

Phoebe: Sounds like he's with someone.

Chandler: He could be alone. This morning I heard him do push-ups, and then talk to his triceps.

Monica: Wait a minute, I think Phoebe's right. You know I hear someone else in there with him.

(they all put their ear against the wall to be able to hear what's being said. We move to Ross's room where he and Charlie are kissing.)

Charlie: Ooh... Dr. Geller!

Ross: God, you're amazing... I didn't even have to ask you to call me that.

Monica: Oh my God, that's Charlie!

Chandler: She's cheating on Joey with Ross!

Phoebe: Oh that tart... floozy... giant...

Monica: I'm not sure about this.

Phoebe: Yeah, you're right. This is none of our business.

Monica: No I'm not sure that it's the best way to hear everything. Someone get me a glass!

Phoebe: Oh, I'm not gonna do this, okay? I'm not gonna eavesdrop on my friend.

Rachel: (through wall) Ooh... I love Barbados!

(Phoebe starts to listen at the other wall, where Rachel's room is. There, Joey and Rachel are kissing.)

Joey: Ooh... I can't believe I'm kissing you. I'm kissing Rachel!

Rachel: I know, I'm her!

(they start to kiss again, and Phoebe turns to Chandler and Monica)

Phoebe: (whispering) Rachel and Joey! It's Rachel and Joey!!!

Monica: What?

Phoebe: Get over here!

(Chandler and Monica take a sprint to the other wall)

Rachel: ooh...

Chandler: Wow!

Monica: (in her Monica-excited-way... TOO LOUD!) Oh my God, I love how thin these walls are!

(In the rooms next door, Joey, Rachel, Ross and Charlie stop kissing and try to understand what the yelling was about. After a while they continue kissing. We're back in Chandler and Monica's room. Monica has some of her own hair stuffed in her mouth by Chandler.)

Monica: (muffled) Thank you.

OPENING CREDITS

(Rachel and Joey's)

Rachel: Hey, you know, before you said that nothing could happen between us? What changed?

Joey: Well, I only said that because of Ross, you know. Then I saw him kissing Charlie...

Rachel: What? Ross and Charlie? (Joey nods) Wow! She's really making her way through the group, huh? Ah, who am I to talk?

(Chandler and Monica's)

Monica: I can't believe this. Rachel and Joey?

Chandler: How about the dinosaur twins in the other room? No-one is manning that wall!

Monica: I'm on it!

Chandler: Anything?

Monica: I think I hear curtains closing...

Phoebe: We've got shoes being kicked off over here.

Monica: Bedsprings, unmistakable!

Chandler: You do realise that's your brother?

Monica: Not until you said it. Somebody switch! (Chandler makes a clicking sound with his fingers and Phoebe runs to the other wall. Monica returns to Chandlers wall.) Wait a minute... Ross and Charlie, Joey and Rachel, Phoebe and Mike! We're the only people leaving with the same person we came with.

Chandler: That's not true. I came with Monica and I'm leaving with Weird Al.

Monica: Okay, I've had it with the hair jokes. Tomorrow morning, before we leave, I'm going to the salon.

Chandler: Okay Buckwheat!

Phoebe: You gotta hear this, it's great... It's like free porn! (Chandler eagerly rushes over)

(Ross and Charlie's)

Ross: Weh...*sigh*

Charlie: uhm... Is everything okay?

Ross: Yeah, It's just... I don't think I can do this...

Charlie: Ooh... Is it because of what might be on the bedspread, because I saw that news report too, with the infra red and the ... I could just...

Ross: No, NO! (they're moving to the side of the bed, where they sit down) Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up. Before anything more happens between us, I need to know he's okay with it.

Charlie: I uhm... I completely understand.

Ross: Alright, I'm gonna go find them... (twitches a bit, looks down) I just need a... need a before I can... you know. (gestures standing up... they sit and wait for a while) Grandma... grandma... grandma... (he tries to concentrate...) Okay, I see you later.

Charlie: Okay...

(Chandler and Monica's, all three of them are listening at the wall to Ross and Charlie's)

Phoebe: That's the door. He's gone...

Chandler: And she's... turning on the TV... and watching... Miss Congeniality!

Monica: Honey, if you know it through a wall, you know it too well!

(They are still listening at the wall, when Ross enters their room)

Ross: Hey, what are you guys doing?

Phoebe: Oh, we're just... we're sad to go so we're just saying goodbye to the hotel. (hugs the wall) I love you... Paradise Hotel, Golf resort and Spa... (she walks away from the wall)

Monica: (also hugs the wall) Yeah, we had a great time, thank you! (walks to Phoebe)

Chandler: (caresses the wall with his finger) Bye!

Ross: Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?

Chandler: He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... (walks to Phoebe and Monica)

Ross: Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?

Chandler: You got it!

Ross: Thanks! (walks out of the room and starts hugging the wall) Thank you! (closes the door)

Monica: Other wall, people! Other wall!

(they rush to the wall to Rachel and Joey's, and we move to that room)

Ross: (knocks on door) Rach, you there? (Joey and Rachel both get up from the bed)

Joey: Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?

Rachel: Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. (Joey like stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides, looking up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.) That's not nonchalant!

Joey: No idea what it means.

Rachel: Oh... okay, just hide!

Ross: (knocks) Rach?

Rachel: Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!

(When Rachel starts to look under the bed if Joey would fit under there, Chandler opens the door inbetween the rooms, grabs Joey by his shirt and drags him to his room, and closes the door again)

Rachel: There's no room under the bed. (looks around because she can't find Joey anymore)

Ross: Is everything okay?

Rachel: Yeah... (still looking to see where Joey went, and opens the door)

Ross: Hey.

Rachel: Hi...

Ross: You know where Joey is?

Rachel: ...I really don't... (looks around again)

Ross: Can I talk to you for a minute?

Rachel: Yeah, sure... (looks outside into the corridor if Joey is there)

(Monica and Chandler's room. Phoebe, Monica and Chandler have their ears pressed against the wall, and Joey looks at them)

Joey: I don't believe this... Have you guys been...

Phoebe: Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.

(Now Joey also wants to listen, and wants to press his ears against the door, which has a big mirror on it, he hesitates seeing himself in the mirror, but still puts his ear against it. We move again to Rachel's room.)

Ross: And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.

Rachel: (clearly not listening and still trying to find out where Joey went) Uh-huh... right... yeah...

Ross: And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.

Rachel: (still searching) Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.

Ross: Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?

Rachel: (now looking up at the ceiling) That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.

Ross: You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.

Rachel: You would think!

(Ross leaves the room)

Rachel: Joey!

Joey: Is he gone?

Rachel: (still can't find him) How are you doing this?

(Joey now enters the room through the door, Monica, Chandler and Phoebe are following him.)

Joey: Pssst...

Rachel: How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?

Monica, Chandler and Phoebe: YE-AH!

Phoebe: Now, what is this?

Rachel: Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!

Phoebe: Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?

Joey: Well, he's with Charlie now.

Monica: Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?

Joey: (long pause and he twitches a bit) You're a pain in my ass, Geller!

Rachel: All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...

Chandler: Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?

Rachel: Sure...

Chandler: Enunciate!

Rachel: Get out!

(They leave and Rachel locks the door.)

Rachel: Are they right?

Joey: Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.

Rachel: Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.

Joey: Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...

Rachel: (Joey walks to the door) Although...

Joey: (turns around very fast) I like although!

Rachel: I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...

Joey: Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...

Rachel: Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.

Joey: Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.

Rachel: No...

Joey: I'm thinking about you...

Rachel: Yeah...

Joey: Let's forget about Ross...

Rachel: Forgotten.

(They want to kiss, but just before their lips touch, Rachel pulls back quickly, gasping)

Joey: What's wrong?

Rachel: Nothing...

Joey's voice, but she sees Ross: Seriously... What is it?

Rachel: Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...

(again, just before their lips touch, she pulls back, gasping)

Joey's voice/Ross: What's wrong?

Rachel: Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...

Joey: Well, maybe I can help. (he grabs her head passionately, closes his eyes and kisses... Ross in Rachel's dress! He realises it too late, and when he does, pushes Ross's/Rachel's head away)

Rachel/Ross: Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again... (and she/he moves in for another kiss. Joey, pushes her head away again...)

Joey: Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...

Both: Yeah

COMMERCIAL BREAK

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's room. Chandler is packing when Ross knocks on the door and enters...]

Ross: Hey!

Chandler: Hey!

Ross: You guys ready to go?

Chandler: Not quite. Monica's still at the salon, and I'm just finishing packing.

Ross: Dude! You're not taking your Bible?

Chandler: You're not supposed to take that. Besides, it's a New Testament, what are you gonna do with it?

Ross: Learn about Jesus...

(Charlie now also enters the room, Chandler walks to the bathroom)

Ross: Hey!

Charlie: So, did you talk to Joey?

Ross: Uh, no... no. I couldn't find him. I'm just gonna talk to him on the plane.

Charlie: Yeah, sounds like a good idea... Dr. Geller!

Ross: Stop it!

Charlie: PHD

Ross: You're filthy!

(Phoebe enters)

Phoebe: Hey, have you guys seen Monica?

Ross: Uh, actually I think she went to the salon.

Phoebe: Oh yeah, oh, she went to the salon alright...

(Monica enters, with her hair braided and little shells at the end)

Monica: Check it out!

Phoebe: Who's day just got better? CHANDLER!

(Chandler enters from the bathroom)

Chandler: Hey!... aaaaaahhhh!

Monica: What do you think?

Chandler: I think.... I think I can see your scalp.

Monica: Don't you just love it?

Ross: Ye... Yeah... Yeah... You got shellfish in your head.

Charlie: It's so... something... You go girlfriend!

Ross: You've never said that in your life, have you?

Charlie: Not once.

Ross: I thought so.

Monica: And listen to this... (shakes her body so the shells tingle)

Chandler: What d'ya know... It's a treat for the eyes and the ears.

[Scene: Boarding the plane.]

Joey: Whoo, whoo. Wow, it's uhm... kinda weird that I'm sitting next to Charlie after we broke up.

Chandler: Yeah, it's almost if Air Barbados doesn't care about your social life.

Joey: Look, does someone mind switching to sit with Charlie?

Ross: Oh, I uh, I mean, I... dude, I spent the whole conference with Charlie.

Joey: I understand...

Ross: No, I'll do it. (he quickly grabs Joey's boarding pass and gives Joey his one.)

Chandler: Wish I could switch with someone. I really don't wanna sit with Allen Iverson over there.

(Switch to Phoebe and Mike, who are kissing)

Phoebe: Uhm... You know, once we're in the air and the captain turns off the seatbelt sign... you feel free to roam about my cabin...

Mike: You should be careful when checking your overhead bins, 'cause items may shift during...

Phoebe: Aaah... you're not good at this...

Mike: You don't have to go home tonight, do you?

Phoebe: No, I think I can come over. It's Saturday, right?

Mike: Oh...

Phoebe: What?

Mike: Uhm... I can't do anything tonight.

Phoebe: Why not?

Mike: I have a date.

Phoebe: You have a... You have a date? With who?

Mike: Oh, it's... my girlfriend.

Phoebe: (lets go of his hand) You have... have a girlfriend?

Mike: Yeah... Well, when... you and I broke up I started seeing someone.

Phoebe: For how long?

Mike: Three months.

Phoebe: Three months? Okay... This is probably none of my business, but uhm, how long do you think you're gonna keep seeing her?

Mike: I'll tell her that it's over tonight at dinner. I promise.

Phoebe: Oh, okay... good. You do that. And then when you get home, maybe there'll be a special delivery package waiting for you.

Mike: Maybe I'll sign for it. Tear it open. Pull out the packing material...

Phoebe: You know what, we're gonna have sex. Let's just leave it there.

(cut to Charlie and Ross)

Ross: Right, I'm gonna go talk to Joey. I think this is the right time. He's always in a good mood after the flight attendant says "duty free".

Charlie: Okay... Good luck.

(Ross gets up and gestures to Rachel, we cut to Joey and Rachel)

Rachel: Ross is coming over. I think now would be a really good time to talk to him.

Joey: I guess so. I'm just... really nervous.

Rachel: Okay, well keep in mind that by the time you're done, they'll probably be serving dinner.

Joey: Ooh...

Rachel: Still nervous?

Joey: I'm gonna get the lasagna.

Ross: Hey Rach...

Rachel: Yeah!

Ross: Do you mind if I sit here for a sec.?

Rachel: Yeah, yeah sure! Yeah! (mouths "Good luck" to Joey and gets up from her seat)

Ross: Hey!

Joey: Hey!

Ross: So, I uhm... kinda need to talk to you about Charlie.

Joey: Yeah?

Ross: Okay, last night after you guys broke up... so sorry to hear about that, by the way... Well, Charlie and I were talking, and..., well...

Joey: You kissed.

Ross: Wha... (gasps) What? What would give you that idea?

Joey: I saw you.

Ross: Yeah, we kissed, but... nothing else... nothing else happened, okay.

Joey: Ross, Ross, Ross... It's okay.

Ross: What?

Joey: It's okay. You know, I totally understand, alright? You guys, make way more sense than her and I ever did, you know. And... I want you to be happy.

Ross: Are you serious?

Joey: Yeah... Now I have something...

Ross: I am speachless... I mean the fact that you would put my happiness first like that. I mean, you're an incredible friend, you know that?

Joey: Oh... uh... look... before you...

Ross: No, I mean it. You are so loyal man, and selfless, and generous...

Joey: I am those things, yeah.

Ross: You know what? I know Chandler longer, so I always think of him as my best friend, but now... I may have to rethink some stuff...

Joey: Dude!

Ross: Hey, if there is ever, anything I can do for you...

Joey: I can't think of anything.

(They both hug, and Rachel, who was in the back of the plane, sees this and smiles.)

Ross: Thanks!

Joey: Yeah.

(Ross walks to the back of the plane, where Rachel is.)

Rachel: So hi!

Ross: Hi!

Rachel: So you eh, you talked to Joey?

Ross: Ah, yeah. We had a really good talk.

Rachel: Oh! That's great!

Ross: Yeah!

Rachel: Oh, so everything's okay?

Ross: Oh, no, it's great. It's great. He is... He is an amazing guy.

Rachel: Ah... Well, obviously I think so too.

Ross: Well, I'm so excited about this.

Rachel: Really? Excited?

Ross: Are you kidding? I have had some very dirty dreams about this...

Rachel: Excuse me! (and she walks back to Joey, who is still looking very impressed about what Ross said to him. Rachel looks at him and hits him.) You didn't tell him, did you?

Joey: I couldn't. He was saying all these really nice things about me. I didn't want him to get mad and take 'em all back. I'm on a edge on Chandler.

Rachel: Oh God! Alright, fine. You know what Joey, forget it. When we go back to New York, I will tell him.

Joey: Thank you. Yeah, I appreciate that.

(Chandler walks by and Joey lets out an evil "muhahaho".)

COMMERCIAL BREAK

[Scene: Mike's apartment. Phoebe's there and the phone rings.]

Phoebe: Hi, Mike's place.

Mike: Hey, it's Mike.

Phoebe: Ooh, that was fast.

Mike: Oh, err... no, she's not here yet. You know, I think I'm just gonna take off and break up with her over the phone...

Phoebe: Yeah, you can't do that! Oh, come on Mike, strap on a pair.Why don't you just tell her that we got back together. You know, women appreciate honesty. We also appreciate gentle spanking once in a while. Just F.Y.I.

Mike: One more thing... There... might be a picture of Precious on my coffee table.

Phoebe: Her name is Precious? Is she a purebreed or did you pick her up at the pound?

Mike: Anyway, I just wanna give you a heads up.

Phoebe: Okay, oh and you know, if she gets upset, just scratch her tummy and give her a liver snout. (laughs and hangs up the phone)

(there's knocking on the door which Phoebe opens)

Precious: Hi, I'm Precious, who are you?

Phoebe: (stunned) I... I'm Phoebe.

Precious: Phoebe? Mike's ex-girlfriend Phoebe, the love of his life? That Phoebe?

Phoebe: EnchantÃ© (she holds out her hand, and they shake hands)

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment. Monica's carrying the laundry hamper to their coffee table.]

Monica: Oh, I can't wait for everyone at work to see these... (plays with her hair to make the shells tingle again) Ow!

Chandler: You go back to work tomorrow night, right?

Monica: Yeah!

Chandler: So if you want people to see them, then by definition you're not having them taken out... say, at the break of dawn?

Monica: Well, if I had them taken out, then I wouldn't be able to do this. (she pushes Chandler on the couch and brushes her hair and shells against Chandler's chest) You like that, right? (again, she brushes her hair against his chest and hums...)

Chandler: What are you singing?

Monica: It's "Bolero" from "10".

Chandler: It's "Ride of the Valkyries" from "Apocalypse Now"... See, here's the thing: The corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy hair problem. And now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore, so if you think about it... I hate them!

Monica: You what? You said you liked them.

Chandler: Did I? Let's refresh. I believe what I said was that I could see your scalp.

Monica: Fine, so you don't like them. Everybody else does.

Chandler: Again, let's journey back... As I recall what Rachel said, was she had never notice the shape of your skull before. And Joey... Well, Joey didn't realise that there was anything different.

Monica: You know what? I don't care. I like it like this, and I'm gonna keep it. You're just jealous because your hair can't do this... (and she shakes her head more violently) OUCH!

Chandler: Hit yourself in the tooth?

Monica: And the eye!

[Scene: Ross's apartment.Someone's knocking on the door. Ross rushes to the door and it's Rachel with Emma.]

Ross: (gasps) Hi... There she is. Hi Emma. Oh my God, I missed you. (kisses her) Oh Emma, I missed you so much. Hey... Did you have a good time with grandma Green? Huh? Did she give you a bottle of anti-depressants again to use as a rattle? (to Rachel)

Rachel: That was one time, Ross, and they were only like 5 milligrams.

Ross: Ooh hey, Emma, daddy has some presents for you okay? Okay? I want you to wait right here. Come here sweetie.

Rachel: Aaah... Ross, actually there's something that I really need to talk to you about.

Ross: (unpacking his bag) Okay, shoot!

Rachel: Okay, uhm... alright, here's the deal.

Ross: (gasps) OH NO!

Rachel: What? What is it?

Ross: Oh, major shampoo explosion!

Rachel: Uh, look Ross, this really isn't easy.

Ross: Oh, it's all over everything. Why? Why me? (looks up)

Rachel: Because you took three hundred bottles of shampoo?

Ross: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You were saying?

Rachel: Well, yeah... Okay, look it's about me and...

Ross: Oh, not another one! Oh my G... And this is moisturiser. It's even harder to clean! Why? Why do bad things happen to good people?

Rachel: Wow! Well, clearly this is not a good time.

Ross: Duh, you think? (enters the kitchen)

[Scene: Mike's place. Phoebe is on the phone.]

Phoebe: Okay, bye. Alright, so Mike's on his way over. See, you thought you guys were meeting here, and he thought you were meeting at the restaurant, so you know... Doesn't really matter who's right or wrong. Point is... I'm gonna take off.

Precious: I'm not letting you leave until you tell me what's going on here. I mean, are you guys getting back together or something?

Phoebe: Alright... Susie, can I call you Susie?

Precious: My name is Precious.

Phoebe: Yeah, I can't say that. uhm... Susie, I'm gonna be straight with you... Mike and I are back together... and uhm... unfortunately that effectively ends your relationship with him. And he's very sorry about that and wishes you the best of luck in all your endeavours.

Precious: I just can't believe this... Why?

Phoebe: Well, I don't...

Precious: Oh, why would he do this? I mean, what's wrong with me?

Phoebe: Nothing, there's nothing wrong with you.

Precious: I mean, what the hell am I supposed to do now?

Phoebe: Damn it woman, pull yourself together! Have some pride, for the love of God.

(Precious starts crying)

Phoebe: Okay, not a fan of the tough love.

Precious: I just can't believe that Mike didn't give me any warning.

Phoebe: But he didn't really know, you know. He wasn't planning on coming to Barbados and proposing to me...

Precious: He proposed to you? This is the worst birthday ever. (she starts to cry again)

Phoebe: Look, Precious... Mike's not worth this. You're an attractive, intelligent woman and let's face it, Mike's kind of a wang. I mean, he proposed to me while he was still seeing you... He was gonna break-up with you on your birthday? And, I don't like to kiss-and-tell, but he cheated on you a lot this weekend.

Precious: Oh, my God, maybe you're right. Maybe I don't need him. I deserve to be treated with respect.

(Mike enters the apartment.)

Precious: Screw you, Mike. You're a coward and a bastard, and I hope you rot in hell.

(she slaps him in the face, Mike looks like he doesn't believe what just happened. Precious leaves, and he turns to Phoebe.)

Phoebe: You're welcome!

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's. Only Chandler is in the living room and walks to the bathroom.]

Chandler: Honey, you've been in there for a long time... Is everything okay?

Monica: Not really.

(Chandler enters the bathroom, and Monica is standing there in a towel, with her hair stuck in the shower curtain.)

Monica: I have a problem.

Chandler: Really? What happened?

Monica: Well, I was dancing around, and singing "No Woman, No Cry" and I got stuck.

Chandler: You can't move at all?

Monica: Oh, well, I can move... (she moves back and forth the shower curtain rail, opening and closing the shower curtain with her hair as she goes)

Chandler: If I untangle you, will you please get rid of the corn rose?

Monica: (looking disappointed) I guess so...

Chandler: (trying to untangle her) Some of these look a little frayed.

Monica: Yeah, I tried to gnaw myself free.

[Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment. Joey enters.]

Joey: Hey!

Rachel: Hi!

Joey: So, did you err... did you tell Ross?

Rachel: Well, I tried, but then he had a shampoo related emergency. So I guess now it's your turn again.

Joey: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no... I think it's better if you tell him, you know. It's easier for a woman. That way, you know, if he gets mad, all you have to do is go... I didn't mean it. I'm so so--ooory. (he pushes his breasts together from the side)

Rachel: Yeah, 'cause that's what we do.

Joey: Alright, alright, okay, uhm... How 'bout this, how about this? Tomorrow... tomorrow we'll both go and we'll tell him together.

Rachel: Okay, that sounds fair. It just means that once again we can't...

Joey: I know, I know..., but that's okay. I mean, we can control ourselves, we're not animals.

Rachel: No! Of course we can wait. Alright, so I guess that means good night then?

Joey: Yeah! Good night! (they give each other a small kiss on the mouth, and stare at each other for a while)

Rachel: Goo--ood night!

Joey: Good night! (they give each other a kiss again, but this time it lasts longer)

Rachel: Seriously, good night!

Joey: Stop saying good night.

Rachel: Okay.

(Now they kiss passionately... and then Ross enters with Emma. They freeze, pull away and look at Ross who looks like he just can't believe what he's seeing. Joey straightens his shirt, and Rachel says I'm so-oo sorry, and presses her breasts together, just like Joey did before.)

COMMERCIAL BREAK

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's. Monica walks in with one of those knitted Rasta hats.]

Monica: Look what I found in the drawer... (Chandler looks up from his book.) And you said I'd never wear this...

Chandler: Now that I untangled you, how 'bout you doing a little something for me?

Monica: Sure, what do you have in mind?

Chandler: I think you know.

Monica: Really? I don't really feel like it.

Chandler: This is what I want to do.

Monica: Okay, I just don't get why you like it so much.

Chandler: (Picks up the "Miss Congeniality" DVD) She's an FBI agent, posing as a beauty contestant.

THE END

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. The scene starts where we took off in the last episode with Ross seeing Joey and Rachel kissing. Rosss tares at them.]

Joey: Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?

Rachel: We weren't doing anything!

Joey: Rach, he just saw us.

Rachel: Shhh.

Joey: But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.

Rachel: No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.

Joey (to Rachel): Dude, chill! (to Ross) Okay, we also kissed in Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie.

Rachel: Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.

Joey: Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..

Rachel: We feel so terrible about this, Ross.

Joey: Yeah, but it did happen, so...

(Ross looks shocked and says nothing.)

Joey: Ross?

Rachel: Ross? (to Joey) Can we just close the door?

OPENING CREDITS

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Continued from earlier.]

Rachel: Ross, say something. Anything.

Ross: So you two are..?

Joey and Rachel: Yeah.

Ross: And have you .. ed?

Joey: No, no, no!

Rachel: No, no, no!

Ross: But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?

Joey: Probably.

(Rachel looks at him.)

Joey: No, no!

Rachel: Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.

Ross: I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?

Rachel: No, but you know what I mean.

Ross: Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you. (Squeaky.) I'm fine!

Joey: Really?

Ross: Absolutely. (Very Squeaky.) I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, (deep voice) I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. (Screams.) But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.

Joey: Ross..

Ross: It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?

Rachel: Calm ourselves?

Ross: No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!

Joey: Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?

Ross: Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!! (Storms off.)

Joey: I do like fajitas.

[Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Chandler are there. They have lots of brochures about adoption in front of them.]

Monica: God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.

Chandler: There's a hair in my coffee.

(Phoebe enters.)

Phoebe: Hey guys!

Monica: Hey.

Phoebe: Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.

Chandler: You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.

(Monica glares at him.)

Monica: That's sweet. Drink your hair.

Phoebe: Hey, what's all this stuff?

Monica: Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.

Phoebe: Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!

Monica: That's not really how it works.

Phoebe: Oh, how does it work?

Monica: I don't know!

Phoebe: Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.

Monica: Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?

(Chandler looks like he did the time he swallowed the toy in 605 TOW Joey's Porsche. It's the hair in his coffee.)

(Frank Jr. and the triplets enter.)

Frank Jr.: Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about. When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.

(The triplets scream and run amok in the coffeehouse.)

Frank Jr.: That's not what we talked about!!

Phoebe: Hey!

Frank Jr.: Hey.

Phoebe: Good to see you.

Frank Jr.: Good to see you, too.

Monica: Hi Frank.

Frank Jr.: Hi, how you doin'?

Monica: Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!

(Little Chandler is pulling Chandler's sweater, while Leslie is throwing bagels at him.)

Monica: Which one is which again?

Frank Jr.: Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him.

Monica (reads a form in her lap): "Willing to adopt triplets?" No!

[Scene: The hallway in Ross's building. Joey and Rachel are on their way to Ross's dinner.]

Joey: Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.

Rachel: Well, what would we be doing?

Joey: I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...

Rachel: Feel me up?

Joey: In a carriage!

(Charlie walks up to them.)

Joey: Hey, Charlie!

Rachel: Hey.

Charlie: Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?

Rachel: Oh, you bet.

(Joey sees that she's carrying a small red bag.)

Joey: So, did you bring a little something for Ross?

Charlie: Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.

Joey: Oh. Oh, thanks.

Charlie: And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.

Joey: Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..

(They enter Ross's apartment. Ross is already quite hyper.)

Ross: I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! (Kisses her.) Hi Joey. (Hugs him.) And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. (Laughs.) I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. (He squeezes her hand.) Come, please come in. Come in.

Rachel: Okay, well, we brought you some wine.

Ross: Oh! That is so thoughtful. (To Joey.) She's a keeper. And what did you bring me? (Grabs the bag that Charlie brought for Joey.)

Joey: Uh, actually, that's..

Ross: Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!

Charlie: Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...

Ross: What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?

Joey: Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.

Ross: You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.

(Does a Mexican dancing-thing before going to the kitchen.)

[Scene: Central Perk. Frank Jr., Phoebe and the triplets are there. The triplets are now sleeping on top of each other on the couch.]

Phoebe: Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.

Frank Jr.: Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.

Phoebe: Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.

Frank Jr.: Yeah.

Phoebe: Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..

Frank Jr.: I haven't slept in four years!

Phoebe: That's a, that's a long time.

Frank Jr.: You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's three of them, Phoebe, three!

Phoebe: Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.

Frank Jr.: Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it, it's too horrible. No.

Phoebe: What?

Frank Jr.: No, I can't.

Phoebe: Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!

Frank Jr.: Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one.

Phoebe: What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?

[Scene: Bill and Colleen's apartment. Chandler and Monica enter.]

Monica: Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.

Colleen: Oh, please, we're happy to help.

Bill: We went through the same thing when we were adopting.

Chandler: So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?

(Bill and Colleen look shocked.)

Chandler: I mean, you have a lovely home.

Monica: Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.

Colleen: Well, actually, I think this might help.

(She gives Monica a big binder that's perfectly in order.)

Colleen: It's pretty much all the information you need.

Monica: Oh my god!

Colleen: Everything is broken down into categories, and then cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.

Monica: Thank you. (To Chandler.) I think I just had a tiny orgasm.

Bill: I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.

Chandler: That's great. (To Monica.) Can I see the book?

(Monica looks at him.)

Chandler: You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?

Monica: It's.. It's just so pretty and white.

Colleen: The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.

(Chandler leaves.)

Colleen: I would have told him to do it too.

Monica: Can I adopt you?

(Cut to the hall. Owen is wearing his scout-uniform and is looking through a box when Chandler walks up to him.)

Chandler: Hey, you must be Owen.

Owen: Yeah.

Chandler: I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.

Owen: You were?

Chandler: Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.

Owen: Huh?

Chandler: You know how to use a compass?

Owen: I have a badge in it.

Chandler: You do? That's fantastic!

Owen: You wanna see it?

Chandler: I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.

Owen: What?!?

Chandler: What?

Owen: I'm adopted?

(Chandler tries to come up with a good answer.)

Chandler: I got nothing.

[Scene: Ross's apartment. Ross is totally wasted, but he's still drinking all the margaritas.]

Ross: The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.

Rachel: Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.

Ross: Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.

Joey: Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?

Ross: I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.

Rachel: No awareness.

Ross: We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?

(The oven timer pings in the kitchen.)

Ross: My fajitas!!

(He runs off to the kitchen.)

Rachel: Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.

Charlie: Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic.

(Joey and Rachel don't know how to respond to that.)

Charlie: Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?

(Ross enters carrying a frying pan with fajitas - without any oven mitts.)

Ross: Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!

Rachel: Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!

(Ross laughs.)

Ross: That is gonna hurt tomorrow!

[Scene: Central Perk. Frank Jr., Phoebe and the triplets are there. Continued from earlier.]

Phoebe: Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?

Frank Jr.: No, of course we're not.

Phoebe: Insane.

Frank Jr.: I know.

Phoebe: Alice would never go for it, right?

Frank Jr.: Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've got her onboard.

Phoebe: Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?

Frank Jr.: Huh.

Phoebe: Frank Jr.Jr.?

Frank Jr.: Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know, he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.

Phoebe: Uh-huh.

Frank Jr.: What's green and says "hey, I'm a frog"? A talking frog! (Laughs.) Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.

Phoebe: Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?

Frank Jr.: Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet.

Phoebe: Alright, so that leaves Chandler.

Frank Jr.: Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor..

Phoebe: Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.

Frank Jr.: Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies.

Phoebe: I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.

Frank Jr.: How about tomorrow?

Phoebe: Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.

Frank Jr.: You'd do that for us?

Phoebe: Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.

Frank Jr. (looks at the triplets): Look at them! Aw. I love you so much. (Strokes Leslie's hair, and she moves a little.) Oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up!

[Scene: Bill and Colleen's apartment. Chandler comes running into the living room. Monica is the only one there.]

Chandler: Where are Bill and Colleen?

Monica: They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?

Chandler: We have to leave!!

Monica: Why? What did you do in the bathroom?

Chandler: I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.

Monica: Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!

(Bill and Colleen enter.)

Colleen: Hey.

Bill: Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen.

Colleen: I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet.

Chandler: But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?

(Owen comes running in.)

Owen: I'm adopted?!

Chandler: See? Intuitive!

Bill: What? Where did you hear that?

Owen: He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.

Chandler: Which technically now you should give back!

Colleen: You told him he's adopted?

Chandler: I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."

Owen: He isn't?!

Chandler (to Monica): We have to get out of here, baby!

[Scene: Ross's apartment. Rachel, Joey and Charlie are eating fajitas when Ross enters from the kitchen.]

Ross: Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.

Rachel: Ooy.

Ross: And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?

Rachel: Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?

Ross: O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.

(Ross chokes up and pauses. Rachel and Joey look at him.)

Joey: Dude, are you okay?

Ross: Totally.

Rachel: Ross, you don't seem okay.

Ross (on the verge of tears): I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.

Charlie: Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.

Ross: No!

Charlie: I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely.

Ross: Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.

Charlie: You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?

Ross: Okay.

Charlie: Alright.

(Ross goes to the kitchen.)

Charlie: God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..

Rachel: Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.

Charlie: Bye.

(Ross enters from the kitchen with three plates with flan.)

Ross: Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!

Rachel: You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.

Ross: Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.

Rachel: No, no, it's just that it's getting late...

Ross: Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.

(The oven timer pings again.)

Ross: I don't even know what that's for.

(He goes back to the kitchen.)

Joey: You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.

Rachel: Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

Joey: Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.

Rachel: Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.

Joey: It doesn't look good, does it?

(They kiss each other on the cheek, and Rachel leaves.)

[Scene: Ross's apartment the next morning. Ross is very hung-over on the couch as Joey enters with a cup of coffee for him.]

Joey: Morning. Here you go.

Ross: Thanks. Did you stay here all night?

Joey: Yeah.

Ross: So you took off my pants and shoes?

Joey: No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.

Ross: What do you mean?

Joey: Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..

Ross: Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!

Joey: It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.

Ross: Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?

Joey: That's what I hear, yeah.

Ross: This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?

Joey: Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...

Ross: Joey.

Joey: I'm crazy about her.

Ross: And she feels the same way?

Joey: I think so.

Ross: Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.

Joey: Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.

Ross: No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?

Joey: No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?

Ross: Yeah, I'm sure.

Joey: And we're okay?

(Ross smiles and holds up his hand for a high-five, but he has forgotten about his burnt hands. He gasps in pain as Joey grabs his hand.)

Chandler: Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.

Monica: What?

Phoebe: Still, he had to find out sometime.

Chandler: Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?

THE END

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. The scene starts where we took off in the last episode with Ross seeing Joey and Rachel kissing. Rosss tares at them.]

Joey: Okay, Ross, I realise that you didn't expect to walk in and see that, but.. Let me explain, okay?

Rachel: We weren't doing anything!

Joey: Rach, he just saw us.

Rachel: Shhh.

Joey: But what you saw, that is the extent of it, okay? One kiss.

Rachel: No, come on, that is a lie. We also kissed in Barbados.

Joey (to Rachel): Dude, chill! (to Ross) Okay, we also kissed in Barbados, but we didn't plan it, okay? And the only reason that that happened was because I saw you kissing Charlie.

Rachel: Yeah, you started it! I've got to chill.

Joey: Look, we probably should have talked to you about this before it ever happened, but..

Rachel: We feel so terrible about this, Ross.

Joey: Yeah, but it did happen, so...

(Ross looks shocked and says nothing.)

Joey: Ross?

Rachel: Ross? (to Joey) Can we just close the door?

Rachel: Ross, say something. Anything.

Ross: So you two are..?

Joey and Rachel: Yeah.

Ross: And have you .. ed?

Joey: No, no, no!

Rachel: No, no, no!

Ross: But if I hadn't walked in here, would you..?

Joey: Probably.

(Rachel looks at him.)

Joey: No, no!

Rachel: Ross, this is not how we wanted you to find out about this. You have every right to go nuts.

Ross: I'm not going nuts. Do you see me go nuts?

Rachel: No, but you know what I mean.

Ross: Hey, hey, hey... If you two are happy, then I'm happy for you. (Squeaky.) I'm fine!

Joey: Really?

Ross: Absolutely. (Very Squeaky.) I'm fine! Totally fine. I don't know why it's coming out all loud and squeaky, 'cause really, (deep voice) I'm fine. I'm not saying I wasn't a little surprised to see you guys kissing. I mean, at first I was like.. (Screams.) But now that I've had time to absorb it; Lovin' this.

Joey: Ross..

Ross: It's all working out! Me & Charlie, and you two. You know what we should do?

Rachel: Calm ourselves?

Ross: No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!

Joey: Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?

Ross: Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!! (Storms off.)

Joey: I do like fajitas.

[Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Chandler are there. They have lots of brochures about adoption in front of them.]

Monica: God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.

Chandler: There's a hair in my coffee.

(Phoebe enters.)

Phoebe: Hey guys!

Monica: Hey.

Phoebe: Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.

Chandler: You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.

(Monica glares at him.)

Monica: That's sweet. Drink your hair.

Phoebe: Hey, what's all this stuff?

Monica: Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.

Phoebe: Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!

Monica: That's not really how it works.

Phoebe: Oh, how does it work?

Monica: I don't know!

Phoebe: Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.

Monica: Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?

(Chandler looks like he did the time he swallowed the toy in 605 TOW Joey's Porsche. It's the hair in his coffee.)

(Frank Jr. and the triplets enter.)

Frank Jr.: Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about. When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.

(The triplets scream and run amok in the coffeehouse.)

Frank Jr.: That's not what we talked about!!

Phoebe: Hey!

Frank Jr.: Hey.

Phoebe: Good to see you.

Frank Jr.: Good to see you, too.

Monica: Hi Frank.

Frank Jr.: Hi, how you doin'?

Monica: Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!

(Little Chandler is pulling Chandler's sweater, while Leslie is throwing bagels at him.)

Monica: Which one is which again?

Frank Jr.: Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him.

Monica (reads a form in her lap): "Willing to adopt triplets?" No!

[Scene: The hallway in Ross's building. Joey and Rachel are on their way to Ross's dinner.]

Joey: Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.

Rachel: Well, what would we be doing?

Joey: I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...

Rachel: Feel me up?

Joey: In a carriage!

(Charlie walks up to them.)

Joey: Hey, Charlie!

Rachel: Hey.

Charlie: Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?

Rachel: Oh, you bet.

(Joey sees that she's carrying a small red bag.)

Joey: So, did you bring a little something for Ross?

Charlie: Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.

Joey: Oh. Oh, thanks.

Charlie: And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.

Joey: Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..

(They enter Ross's apartment. Ross is already quite hyper.)

Ross: I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! (Kisses her.) Hi Joey. (Hugs him.) And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. (Laughs.) I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. (He squeezes her hand.) Come, please come in. Come in.

Rachel: Okay, well, we brought you some wine.

Ross: Oh! That is so thoughtful. (To Joey.) She's a keeper. And what did you bring me? (Grabs the bag that Charlie brought for Joey.)

Joey: Uh, actually, that's..

Ross: Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!

Charlie: Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...

Ross: What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?

Joey: Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.

Ross: You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.

(Does a Mexican dancing-thing before going to the kitchen.)

[Scene: Central Perk. Frank Jr., Phoebe and the triplets are there. The triplets are now sleeping on top of each other on the couch.]

Phoebe: Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.

Frank Jr.: Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.

Phoebe: Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.

Frank Jr.: Yeah.

Phoebe: Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..

Frank Jr.: I haven't slept in four years!

Phoebe: That's a, that's a long time.

Frank Jr.: You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's three of them, Phoebe, three!

Phoebe: Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.

Frank Jr.: Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it, it's too horrible. No.

Phoebe: What?

Frank Jr.: No, I can't.

Phoebe: Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!

Frank Jr.: Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one.

Phoebe: What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?

[Scene: Bill and Colleen's apartment. Chandler and Monica enter.]

Monica: Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.

Colleen: Oh, please, we're happy to help.

Bill: We went through the same thing when we were adopting.

Chandler: So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?

(Bill and Colleen look shocked.)

Chandler: I mean, you have a lovely home.

Monica: Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.

Colleen: Well, actually, I think this might help.

(She gives Monica a big binder that's perfectly in order.)

Colleen: It's pretty much all the information you need.

Monica: Oh my god!

Colleen: Everything is broken down into categories, and then cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.

Monica: Thank you. (To Chandler.) I think I just had a tiny orgasm.

Bill: I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.

Chandler: That's great. (To Monica.) Can I see the book?

(Monica looks at him.)

Chandler: You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?

Monica: It's.. It's just so pretty and white.

Colleen: The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.

(Chandler leaves.)

Colleen: I would have told him to do it too.

Monica: Can I adopt you?

(Cut to the hall. Owen is wearing his scout-uniform and is looking through a box when Chandler walks up to him.)

Chandler: Hey, you must be Owen.

Owen: Yeah.

Chandler: I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.

Owen: You were?

Chandler: Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.

Owen: Huh?

Chandler: You know how to use a compass?

Owen: I have a badge in it.

Chandler: You do? That's fantastic!

Owen: You wanna see it?

Chandler: I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.

Owen: What?!?

Chandler: What?

Owen: I'm adopted?

(Chandler tries to come up with a good answer.)

Chandler: I got nothing.

[Scene: Ross's apartment. Ross is totally wasted, but he's still drinking all the margaritas.]

Ross: The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.

Rachel: Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.

Ross: Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.

Joey: Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?

Ross: I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.

Rachel: No awareness.

Ross: We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?

(The oven timer pings in the kitchen.)

Ross: My fajitas!!

(He runs off to the kitchen.)

Rachel: Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.

Charlie: Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic.

(Joey and Rachel don't know how to respond to that.)

Charlie: Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?

(Ross enters carrying a frying pan with fajitas - without any oven mitts.)

Ross: Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!

Rachel: Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!

(Ross laughs.)

Ross: That is gonna hurt tomorrow!

[Scene: Central Perk. Frank Jr., Phoebe and the triplets are there. Continued from earlier.]

Phoebe: Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?

Frank Jr.: No, of course we're not.

Phoebe: Insane.

Frank Jr.: I know.

Phoebe: Alice would never go for it, right?

Frank Jr.: Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've got her onboard.

Phoebe: Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?

Frank Jr.: Huh.

Phoebe: Frank Jr.Jr.?

Frank Jr.: Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know, he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.

Phoebe: Uh-huh.

Frank Jr.: What's green and says "hey, I'm a frog"? A talking frog! (Laughs.) Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.

Phoebe: Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?

Frank Jr.: Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet.

Phoebe: Alright, so that leaves Chandler.

Frank Jr.: Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor..

Phoebe: Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.

Frank Jr.: Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies.

Phoebe: I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.

Frank Jr.: How about tomorrow?

Phoebe: Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.

Frank Jr.: You'd do that for us?

Phoebe: Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.

Frank Jr. (looks at the triplets): Look at them! Aw. I love you so much. (Strokes Leslie's hair, and she moves a little.) Oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up!

[Scene: Bill and Colleen's apartment. Chandler comes running into the living room. Monica is the only one there.]

Chandler: Where are Bill and Colleen?

Monica: They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?

Chandler: We have to leave!!

Monica: Why? What did you do in the bathroom?

Chandler: I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.

Monica: Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!

(Bill and Colleen enter.)

Colleen: Hey.

Bill: Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen.

Colleen: I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet.

Chandler: But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?

(Owen comes running in.)

Owen: I'm adopted?!

Chandler: See? Intuitive!

Bill: What? Where did you hear that?

Owen: He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.

Chandler: Which technically now you should give back!

Colleen: You told him he's adopted?

Chandler: I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."

Owen: He isn't?!

Chandler (to Monica): We have to get out of here, baby!

[Scene: Ross's apartment. Rachel, Joey and Charlie are eating fajitas when Ross enters from the kitchen.]

Ross: Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.

Rachel: Ooy.

Ross: And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?

Rachel: Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?

Ross: O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.

(Ross chokes up and pauses. Rachel and Joey look at him.)

Joey: Dude, are you okay?

Ross: Totally.

Rachel: Ross, you don't seem okay.

Ross (on the verge of tears): I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.

Charlie: Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.

Ross: No!

Charlie: I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely.

Ross: Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.

Charlie: You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?

Ross: Okay.

Charlie: Alright.

(Ross goes to the kitchen.)

Charlie: God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..

Rachel: Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.

Charlie: Bye.

(Ross enters from the kitchen with three plates with flan.)

Ross: Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!

Rachel: You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.

Ross: Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.

Rachel: No, no, it's just that it's getting late...

Ross: Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.

(The oven timer pings again.)

Ross: I don't even know what that's for.

(He goes back to the kitchen.)

Joey: You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.

Rachel: Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

Joey: Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.

Rachel: Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.

Joey: It doesn't look good, does it?

(They kiss each other on the cheek, and Rachel leaves.)

[Scene: Ross's apartment the next morning. Ross is very hung-over on the couch as Joey enters with a cup of coffee for him.]

Joey: Morning. Here you go.

Ross: Thanks. Did you stay here all night?

Joey: Yeah.

Ross: So you took off my pants and shoes?

Joey: No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.

Ross: This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?

Joey: Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...

Ross: Joey.

Joey: I'm crazy about her.

Ross: And she feels the same way?

Joey: I think so.

Ross: Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.

Joey: Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.

Ross: No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?

Joey: No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?

Ross: Yeah, I'm sure.

Rachel: Calm ourselves?

Ross: No. We should all have dinner. Yes, we'll do it tomorrow night. I'll cook!!

Joey: Look, don't you think that will be a little weird?

Ross: Weird? What? What's weird? The only thing weird would be if someone didn't like Mexican food, because I'm making fajitas!! (Storms off.)

Joey: I do like fajitas.

[Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Chandler are there. They have lots of brochures about adoption in front of them.]

Monica: God, this adoption stuff is so overwhelming. There's inter-country adoption, dependency adoption.. There are so many ways to go, and this is like the biggest decision of our lives.

Chandler: There's a hair in my coffee.

(Phoebe enters.)

Phoebe: Hey guys!

Monica: Hey.

Phoebe: Hey, have you seen Frank Jr., 'cause he's meeting me here with the triplets.

Chandler: You know, it's funny. Every time you say "triplets," I immediately think of three hot blonde 19-year olds.

(Monica glares at him.)

Monica: That's sweet. Drink your hair.

Phoebe: Hey, what's all this stuff?

Monica: Oh, they're brochures from different adoption agencies.

Phoebe: Ooh, babies! Oh, this one is so cute, get this one!

Monica: That's not really how it works.

Phoebe: Oh, how does it work?

Monica: I don't know!

Phoebe: Well, if you're having a hard time, you should talk to my friends, Bill and Colleen. They adopted a kid. I'm sure they'd help you.

Monica: Thanks, that would be great. Hey, honey, wouldn't that be great?

(Chandler looks like he did the time he swallowed the toy in 605 TOW Joey's Porsche. It's the hair in his coffee.)

(Frank Jr. and the triplets enter.)

Frank Jr.: Alright, alright, alright. Remember what we talked about. When we're in a public place, there are certain rules.

(The triplets scream and run amok in the coffeehouse.)

Frank Jr.: That's not what we talked about!!

Phoebe: Hey!

Frank Jr.: Hey.

Phoebe: Good to see you.

Frank Jr.: Good to see you, too.

Monica: Hi Frank.

Frank Jr.: Hi, how you doin'?

Monica: Oh, my goodness, they've all gotten so big!

(Little Chandler is pulling Chandler's sweater, while Leslie is throwing bagels at him.)

Monica: Which one is which again?

Frank Jr.: Oh, that's Frank Jr. Jr. pulling the tampons out of the lady's purse. And that's Chandler climbing on Chandler, and that's Leslie throwing bagels at him.

Monica (reads a form in her lap): "Willing to adopt triplets?" No!

[Scene: The hallway in Ross's building. Joey and Rachel are on their way to Ross's dinner.]

Joey: Ah, can I just say I know we're doing this for Ross, and that's cool, but if it was up to me, this is not what we'd be doing on our first date.

Rachel: Well, what would we be doing?

Joey: I'd take you out for a romantic night. Some champagne, fancy dinner, feel you up on the carriage ride home...

Rachel: Feel me up?

Joey: In a carriage!

(Charlie walks up to them.)

Joey: Hey, Charlie!

Rachel: Hey.

Charlie: Hi, hi. So.. Dreading this?

Rachel: Oh, you bet.

(Joey sees that she's carrying a small red bag.)

Joey: So, did you bring a little something for Ross?

Charlie: Actually.. It's stuff you left at my apartment.

Joey: Oh. Oh, thanks.

Charlie: And you know, you can just give me my stuff whenever you want.

Joey: Yeah, I didn't throw any of that out..

(They enter Ross's apartment. Ross is already quite hyper.)

Ross: I thought I heard voices! Hi Charlie! (Kisses her.) Hi Joey. (Hugs him.) And.. Oh! You're gonna have to introduce me to your new girlfriend. (Laughs.) I'm just kidding, I know Rachel, I know. (He squeezes her hand.) Come, please come in. Come in.

Rachel: Okay, well, we brought you some wine.

Ross: Oh! That is so thoughtful. (To Joey.) She's a keeper. And what did you bring me? (Grabs the bag that Charlie brought for Joey.)

Joey: Uh, actually, that's..

Ross: Underwear, a toothbrush, and Van Halen CD. I can use all these things!!

Charlie: Gosh, Ross, you know, you seem a little...

Ross: What? Fine? Because I am! Aren't you? Aren't you? Aren't you? You see? Who else is fine?

Joey: Okay, listen, hey, Ross. Why don't you try to relax, okay? Maybe have a drink.

Ross: You know what? That is a very good idea. I'm gonna go make a pitcher of Margaritas.

(Does a Mexican dancing-thing before going to the kitchen.)

[Scene: Central Perk. Frank Jr., Phoebe and the triplets are there. The triplets are now sleeping on top of each other on the couch.]

Phoebe: Oh, god. So adorable. Look at them sleeping there like angels.

Frank Jr.: Yeah, I really cherish these moments, 'cause before you know it, they're gonna be awake again.

Phoebe: Well, they may be a handful, but they're so cute.

Frank Jr.: Yeah.

Phoebe: Oh, god, the last time I babysat them, they did the funniest thing..

Frank Jr.: I haven't slept in four years!

Phoebe: That's a, that's a long time.

Frank Jr.: You just don't know how hard it is, Phoebe. There's just so many of them. You know, two I can handle. Two's great. You just hold one in each hand, but what do I do when the third one runs at me with his bike helmet on. I've got no more hands to protect my area! There's three of them, Phoebe, three!

Phoebe: Yeah, I know, Frank. I counted them when they were coming out of my area.

Frank Jr.: Sometimes I think that.. Oh, no, no, no, I can't say it, it's too horrible. No.

Phoebe: What?

Frank Jr.: No, I can't.

Phoebe: Oh my god, Frank, are you thinking of leaving? Because I didn't have those triplets so you could just run out on them!

Frank Jr.: Oh, no! I would never do that. No. I just was thinking that, you know, maybe you could take one.

Phoebe: What?! You can't separate them! That's terrible. Which one?

[Scene: Bill and Colleen's apartment. Chandler and Monica enter.]

Monica: Thank you so much for seeing us. Phoebe has told us such great things about you guys.

Colleen: Oh, please, we're happy to help.

Bill: We went through the same thing when we were adopting.

Chandler: So, a lot of malfunctioning wee-wees and hoo-hoos in this room, huh?

(Bill and Colleen look shocked.)

Chandler: I mean, you have a lovely home.

Monica: Well, we appreciate anything you can tell us.

Colleen: Well, actually, I think this might help.

(She gives Monica a big binder that's perfectly in order.)

Colleen: It's pretty much all the information you need.

Monica: Oh my god!

Colleen: Everything is broken down into categories, and then cross-referenced, and then colour-coded to correspond with the forms in the back.

Monica: Thank you. (To Chandler.) I think I just had a tiny orgasm.

Bill: I know the process is frustrating, but it's so worth it. Adopting Owen was the best thing that ever happened to us.

Chandler: That's great. (To Monica.) Can I see the book?

(Monica looks at him.)

Chandler: You want me to wash my hands first, don't you?

Monica: It's.. It's just so pretty and white.

Colleen: The bathroom is down the hall, to your left.

(Chandler leaves.)

Colleen: I would have told him to do it too.

Monica: Can I adopt you?

(Cut to the hall. Owen is wearing his scout-uniform and is looking through a box when Chandler walks up to him.)

Chandler: Hey, you must be Owen.

Owen: Yeah.

Chandler: I'm Chandler. Hey, I was in the scouts too.

Owen: You were?

Chandler: Yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.

Owen: Huh?

Chandler: You know how to use a compass?

Owen: I have a badge in it.

Chandler: You do? That's fantastic!

Owen: You wanna see it?

Chandler: I'd love to, but I gotta get back to talking to your parents. They're telling us all about how they adopted you.

Owen: What?!?

Chandler: What?

Owen: I'm adopted?

(Chandler tries to come up with a good answer.)

Chandler: I got nothing.

[Scene: Ross's apartment. Ross is totally wasted, but he's still drinking all the margaritas.]

Ross: The first batch of margaritas was not so great, but the second batch is gooooood.

Rachel: Well, maybe the next batch, we could all get some.

Ross: Oh, guys, this is fun, isn't it? You know? Just the four of us. Just hangin'.

Joey: Dude, are you okay? And when are the fajitas gonna be ready?

Ross: I'm fine! Hey, I'm great! I'm just.. I'm just proud of us. There's no weirdness, no tension.

Rachel: No awareness.

Ross: We make a great foursome. We should do more stuff together. Ooh! Let's take a trip. Okay, where do you think we - we can go?

(The oven timer pings in the kitchen.)

Ross: My fajitas!!

(He runs off to the kitchen.)

Rachel: Look, Charlie, I just want you to know. Ross is just having a little trouble adjusting to the thought of Joey and me. You know, he normally doesn't drink like this.

Charlie: Oh, you know what? This is nothing. My father is a raging alcoholic.

(Joey and Rachel don't know how to respond to that.)

Charlie: Oh, I'm sorry, have I made this evening uncomfortable?

(Ross enters carrying a frying pan with fajitas - without any oven mitts.)

Ross: Fajitas! Be careful, very hot plate, very hot plate!!

Rachel: Ross, you don't even have oven mitts on!

(Ross laughs.)

Ross: That is gonna hurt tomorrow!

[Scene: Central Perk. Frank Jr., Phoebe and the triplets are there. Continued from earlier.]

Phoebe: Okay, well, this is crazy. Can't seriously be talking about me taking one of your kids, can we?

Frank Jr.: No, of course we're not.

Phoebe: Insane.

Frank Jr.: I know.

Phoebe: Alice would never go for it, right?

Frank Jr.: Oh, I don't know, she's pretty tired, too, I think we've got her onboard.

Phoebe: Well, just you know, for argument's sake, you know, hypothetically. Which one would you be willing to give up?

Frank Jr.: Huh.

Phoebe: Frank Jr.Jr.?

Frank Jr.: Oh, you'd be getting a really good one. I mean, you know, he's really funny. Like, the other day he made up this joke.

Phoebe: Uh-huh.

Frank Jr.: What's green and says "hey, I'm a frog"? A talking frog! (Laughs.) Oh, no, you can't have him, he's too funny.

Phoebe: Well, alright, that's fine. What about Leslie?

Frank Jr.: Oh, no, no. Not Leslie. No, she's, she's the only one that knows how to burp the alphabet.

Phoebe: Alright, so that leaves Chandler.

Frank Jr.: Oh, no, no, you can't have Chandler, no. No, no. She's my little genius. I got big hopes for her. She's gonna be a doctor or a realtor..

Phoebe: Wow, Frank. I think we just ran out of kids.

Frank Jr.: Oh, I think you're right. Oh, wow. Phoebe, I don't think I can give one of them up. I mean, you know, they drive me crazy, but they're my babies.

Phoebe: I'm sorry, Frank. I didn't realise things were so bad. You know, I'll help out more. I can - I can babysit any time you want. You name the day, and I'll be there.

Frank Jr.: How about tomorrow?

Phoebe: Well, that's not good. But you know, I can move some stuff around, and I'll be there. You and Alice just take the whole day together.

Frank Jr.: You'd do that for us?

Phoebe: Are you kidding? That's what sisters are for.

Frank Jr. (looks at the triplets): Look at them! Aw. I love you so much. (Strokes Leslie's hair, and she moves a little.) Oh crap, don't wake up, don't wake up!

[Scene: Bill and Colleen's apartment. Chandler comes running into the living room. Monica is the only one there.]

Chandler: Where are Bill and Colleen?

Monica: They're in the kitchen getting something to eat. Can you believe how nice they are?

Chandler: We have to leave!!

Monica: Why? What did you do in the bathroom?

Chandler: I didn't get to the bathroom. I bumped into Owen on the way, and he didn't know he was adopted. And there's a slight chance I may have told him.

Monica: Oh my god, where's my purse? No, you know what? I can replace everything in there. Get that binder, and let's go!

(Bill and Colleen enter.)

Colleen: Hey.

Bill: Some little snacks for everybody. Oh, you don't have to eat the sour worms. Those are for Owen.

Colleen: I'll go get him in a second. By the way, you should know we haven't told him he's adopted yet.

Chandler: But kids are so intuitive. Don't you think on some level he already knows?

(Owen comes running in.)

Owen: I'm adopted?!

Chandler: See? Intuitive!

Bill: What? Where did you hear that?

Owen: He told me! And he paid me 50 dollars not to tell.

Chandler: Which technically now you should give back!

Colleen: You told him he's adopted?

Chandler: I'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or something. Or at least whisper it to people when they come in the door. "Owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that Santa is real."

Owen: He isn't?!

Chandler (to Monica): We have to get out of here, baby!

[Scene: Ross's apartment. Rachel, Joey and Charlie are eating fajitas when Ross enters from the kitchen.]

Ross: Everyone? I would like to make a toast to Rachel and Joey.

Rachel: Ooy.

Ross: And to love. Ah, love. L-O-V-E, love. L is for life. And what is life without love?

Rachel: Oh my god, are we supposed to answer?

Ross: O is for "oh, wow!" The V is for this very surprising turn of events, which I'm still fine with by the way. E is for how extremely normal I find it. That you two are together. And now one day you might get married and have children of your own.

(Ross chokes up and pauses. Rachel and Joey look at him.)

Joey: Dude, are you okay?

Ross: Totally.

Rachel: Ross, you don't seem okay.

Ross (on the verge of tears): I'm sorry, it must be the pressure of entertaining. I think everyone would feel better if we had some flan.

Charlie: Wait, Ross. Ross. I - I have to take off.

Ross: No!

Charlie: I'm sorry, I have a really early class in the morning, but this has been lovely.

Ross: Wasn't it? And you thought it would be awkward with Joey and that you never really liked Rachel.

Charlie: You're on fire! I'll call you in the morning, okay?

Ross: Okay.

Charlie: Alright.

(Ross goes to the kitchen.)

Charlie: God, Rachel, what Ross just said that is just so..

Rachel: Oh, that's okay, girls tend not to like me.

Charlie: Bye.

(Ross enters from the kitchen with three plates with flan.)

Ross: Okay, I guess it's just flan for three! Hey, hey, that rhymed!

Rachel: You know what, Ross? I think we're gonna take off too.

Ross: Oh, oh. Of course. God, I'm so stupid. You guys are a couple now. I mean, you probably just want to be alone.

Rachel: No, no, it's just that it's getting late...

Ross: Hey, hey, it's fine. It's totally fine. We've got plenty of margaritas. It's all good.

(The oven timer pings again.)

Ross: I don't even know what that's for.

(He goes back to the kitchen.)

Joey: You know what? I think I'm gonna stay here and make sure he's okay.

Rachel: Yeah, that's probably a good idea.

Joey: Yeah. I'll see you in the morning.

Rachel: Uh-huh. Okay. You know what, Joey, I don't think he's ever gonna be okay with this.

Joey: It doesn't look good, does it?

(They kiss each other on the cheek, and Rachel leaves.)

[Scene: Ross's apartment the next morning. Ross is very hung-over on the couch as Joey enters with a cup of coffee for him.]

Joey: Morning. Here you go.

Ross: Thanks. Did you stay here all night?

Joey: Yeah.

Ross: So you took off my pants and shoes?

Joey: No, no, no. You actually did that when you were dancing to the Chicago-soundtrack. Look, Ross, about, about Rachel and I. Listen, you don't have to worry about that, okay? Because nothing is gonna happen.

Ross: What do you mean?

Joey: Well, she and I said from the beginning that we weren't gonna do anything unless you were okay with it. And clearly..

Ross: Hey, what are you talking about? I'm fine!

Joey: It's okay, Ross, alright? I totally understand. Of course you're not fine. You're.. You're Ross and Rachel.

Ross: Except we're not. I mean, we haven't been a couple in like, six years. Oh my god, is that right? Has it been that long?

Joey: That's what I hear, yeah.

Ross: This is crazy. I mean, six years? And because of me you guys aren't gonna be together? Can I ask you something? Really, what is this thing with you and Rachel?

Joey: Come on, I mean, you know me, you know...

Ross: Joey.

Joey: I'm crazy about her.

Ross: And she feels the same way?

Joey: I think so.

Ross: Well, then, maybe it's time we all moved on.

Joey: Yeah, but, Ross, I mean, you're not okay with it.

Ross: No, but I wanna be. Hey, I will be. Besides, I'm with Charlie, right? Oh my god, I'm still with Charlie, aren't I? I mean, she didn't see the dance, did she?

Joey: No, no, no, no, that was - that was just for me. Are you sure about this?

Ross: Yeah, I'm sure.

Joey: And we're okay?

(Ross smiles and holds up his hand for a high-five, but he has forgotten about his burnt hands. He gasps in pain as Joey grabs his hand.)

[Scene: Central Perk. Monica and Chandler enter to find Phoebe there with the triplets.]

Monica: Hey, Phoebs

Phoebe: Hey.

Monica: Uhm, we just wanna give you a heads-up. Bill and Colleen hate us.

Chandler: Owen didn't know he was adopted, and Monica told him.

Monica: What?

Phoebe: Still, he had to find out sometime.

Chandler: Yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets that you gave birth to them?

(The triplets stare at him.)

Chandler: I'm gonna go tell Emma she was an accident. (Runs off.)

Chandler: How can you be so confident?

Joey: Well, I... I know exactly what I'm gonna do!

Chandler: Really? Like you have a routine?

Joey: No, no no no no. See. Each woman is different.You have to appreciate their uniqueness.

Chandler: Really?

Joey: No, I do six things! First, I look deep in her eyes. Then, I kiss her. Next I take my hand and I softly graze her thigh.

Chandler: You mean like this? (he starts touching his thigh in a funny and awkard way)

Joey: NO! Not like that, no no. No, like this. (He starts lightly grazing Chandler's thigh)

Chandler: Oh, I see what you mean, that's quite nice. (They look at each other, both embarassed)

Chandler: ...and beer!!


OPENING CREDITS
[Scene:Central Perk. Ross and Chandler are on the couch]

Monica: (entering) Hey!

Ross and Chandler: Hey!

Monica: (to Chandler) Hey sweetie! (they kiss)

Ross: (looking at Monica's legs) WOW!

Chandler: Hey! Stop staring at my wife's legs! No no! Stop staring at your sister's legs!

Ross: I'm sorry, it's just... how did you get so tan?

Chandler: She went on one of those spray-on tan places.

Ross: Eh, you got a spray-on tan?

Monica: Chandler gets pedicures!

Ross: (laughing) Why, why you do, like with the-the toe separators?

Chandler: (To Monica) Why...why?

Ross: Still, I can't believe that's sprayed on... I mean, it looks really good. I wonder if I should get one!

Chandler: Sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can really show it off.

Ross: So, do you get colours or just French tips?

Monica: There. Here's their card.

Ross: Thanks. (he takes the card) Hey, I know where this place is! It used to be an X-rated video... (pauses when he realizes what he is saying) florist. (he goes away)

(Phoebe enters)

Phoebe: Hey!

Chandler: Hey Pheebs!

Monica: Hey Phoebe!

Phoebe: Oh, you won't believe who moved back to town.

Monica: I know, Amanda! Ah! She called me too! She's the worst!

Chandler: Who's Amanda?

Monica: She's this girl who used to live in the building before you did. Then she moved to England and she picked up this fake British accent. On the machine this is her message. (she apes Amanda using an awful British accent) "Monica, darling! It's Amanda calling!"

Chandler: Are you trying to do a British accent?

Monica: (pause) (to Phoebe) Chandler gets pedicures!

Chandler: Just so I know, how many more of those can I expect?

Phoebe: You know what Amanda said to me when she got me on the phone? (apes Amanda in a british accent) "Oh, so sorry to catch you on your Mo-Bile!" If-if you don't wanna get me on my mo-Bile, don't call me on my mo-Bile!"

Monica: I know, and she's always bragging about all the famous people she's met.

Phoebe: Oh, I know! "Oh...I slept with Billy Joel". All right, who hasn't?

Monica: Oh, what are we gonna do! I don't wanna see her!!

Phoebe: Ugh, Let's just cut her out!

Monica: What?

Phoebe: Cut her out of our lives! Just ignore her calls and dodge her 'till she gets the point!

Monica: Oh, I guess we could try that, but... it seems so harsh! (to Chandler) Have you ever done that?

Chandler: No, had it done to me though. Feels good !
[Scene: At the tanning salon. Ross and a male assistant are walking through a hall]

Assistant: Alright Mr. Geller! Right this way! So, how dark do you wanna be? We have one, two or three.
Ross: Well... I like how you look, what are you?

Assistant: Puerto Rican.

Ross: Two, I think a two.

Assistant: You've got to face the red light. When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes. When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?

Ross: Spray, count, pat, then turn, spray, count and pat.

Assistant: Wow, you catch on quick.

Ross: Well, I have a PhD, so... (assistant walk out, not impressed by this statement)
(Ross takes his bathrobe off and he enters the tanning booth. He stands up in front of the red light and the sprayer starts and sprays his face and torso)

Ross: One Mississipi, two Mississipi, Three Mis...(the sprayer starts again, spraying him in the face and torso again) WAIT! WAIT! I'm not-I've not finished counting!! (he leaves the booth) (the assistant enters the room)

Ross: You sprayed my front twice!

Assistant: You've never turned?
Ross: No, I barely even got to three Mississippi.

Assistant: Mississippi? I said count to five'!

Ross: Mississippilesly? (pause) Well, how bad is it?

Assistant: Ain't that bad yet, but it keeps getting darker for the next four hours.

Ross: So, how dark is it gonna get?

Assistant: You got sprayed with two two' s and...

Ross: I'm a four?

Assistant: Yeah, but you're back's a zero. You're gonna wanna even that out.

Ross: (sarcastically) Really!

Assistant: You might wanna get back in there.

Ross: (annoyed) Ok!

(The assistant leaves and Ross goes back in the spray-on tan booth and turns his back to the spray nozzles, facing the back wall)

Ross: Wait, wait a minute, there's no light on the back wall! How do I know when it's gonna start? Hello? (he slowly turns and the spraying begins, on his face) Ah, oh, ah! (he turns, but then he turns again and is sprayed in the front again) Ah! (he spits and angrily goes out of the spray-on tan booth and the assistant enters the room) The same thing happened again!

Assistant: You got two more twos?

Ross: (hysterically) I'm an eight!

[Scene: Joeyâs apartment. Joey and Rachel enter the room]

Rachel: Thanks for dinner.
Joey: I thought you paid. (Rachel does not answer and seems puzzled) Ha, guess we wonât be going back there!

Rachel: So.

Joey: Yeah.

(Joey and Rachel start kissing)

Joey: Hey what do you say, we move this onto the likes of the couch?

Rachel: I say âcheesy lineâ, but ok.

(They move on the couch and start kissing again. Joey does his grazing on Rachelâs thigh and she slaps his hand)

Joey: Whatâs the matter?

Rachel: I am sorry, I donât know, I am sorry, I donât know why I did that!

Monica: (to Phoebe) No, no, donât get it. Let the machine pick up.
Phoebe: Oh, yeah. Could be Rachel asking if someone could baby-sit again.

Monica: It could be Amanda!

Phoebe: Oh, youâre right! I was just kidding about Rachel. Babysitting is a gas!

Amanda: Yes, I was looking for Monica.

Chandler: Hang on, sheâs right here. (he enters the living room and hands the phone to Monica) Someone's on the phone, for ya.

Monica: We werenât picking up, itâs Amanda!

Chandler: (to Amanda) I get pedicures!

Monica: Hi Amanda! Actually now... itâs... is not a good time. Dinner tomorrow night? (Phoebe mouths 'no') Ok, Phoebe and I will see you then!

Phoebe: Why, why, why didnât you just say no!

Monica: Well, I said 'no' to her coming over now! I couldnât say 'no' twice! I get this uncontrollable need to please people!

Phoebe: (leaving) Fine, fine! You would not hold up well under torture!

Monica: And you would?

Phoebe: I did!
[scene: Joeyâs apartment. Joey and Rachel are sitting on the couch]

Joey: Rach, you sure you wanna do this?
Rachel: Absolutely! Absolutely. I d... itâs just a little weird, itâs you, and itâs me, it's just gonna take some getting used to.

Joey: Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?

Rachel: Ok, letâs work from the top down! (Joey nods, but then puzzled because he does not get it) Just work the bra, Joe!

Rachel: Ow!

Joey: Sorry!

Rachel: Well this is romantic!

Joey: I'm sorry! (He stands up) This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!

Rachel: Itâs a standard issue bra clasp!

Joey: Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!

Rachel: Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?

Joey: (contemplates for a few moments what Rachel just said) NAH! I don't have another level!!
[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment]

Ross: I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.

Chandler: Was that place... The Sun?

Ross: Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler and Monica and pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across his body, where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)

Chandler: Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!

Monica: How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!

Ross: (looks at her suspiciously) How do you count to five?

Monica: One Two Three...

Ross: (Yells) Damnit! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel just enters, sees him and starts laughing)

Rachel: (laughing) oooh! Oh oh!

Ross: (Still yelling) I Know!

Rachel: oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?

Chandler: How was your date with Joey?

Rachel: Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!

Chandler: You didn't like that?

Rachel: Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!

Monica: Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.

(Chandler starts looking at her bra)

Rachel: I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.

Monica: Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.

Rachel: (looking thoughtful) Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!

(Joey walks in)

Joey: Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second (points to the hall).

Rachel: (To Joey) No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through (At which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment).

Phoebe: No.

Monica: (sits down) Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.

Phoebe: Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?

Monica: Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?

Amanda: (In a fake British accent) It's so nice to see you! Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! (gives her coat to Monica as well) Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch my abs (at which point she grabs both Phoebe and Monica's hands and places them both on her stomach) I don't exercise at all! (she pulls them down to sit.) Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married!

Monica: (beaming) Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...

Amanda: (To Phoebe) Smell my neck! (Phoebe does so) It's not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent!

(Monica looks shocked)

Phoebe: Musty!

Amanda: Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!

Monica: When were we not friends?

Amanda: Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was the year I had sex with Evil Knievel (She starts laughing very proudly).

Monica: Ehm, we were friends in 1992.

Amanda: (to Phoebe) No I distinctly remember you were dodging her (points at Monica) calls and trying to avoid seeing her.

Monica: (To Phoebe) You were going to cut me out?

Phoebe: Well...kinda.

Monica: Oh My God!

Amanda: Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like a perfect arse!

Phoebe: Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass".

(Monica's mobile starts ringing. She picks it up.)

Joey: Uh! (When she's done she throws her bra at him)

Rachel: Ok (starts to light some candles) Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey, clearly very excited) Alright! Lets do it!

Joey: Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.

Rachel: Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! (She pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You like that huh?

Joey: Oh! yeah!

Rachel: You like that? (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively, putting her knees next to Joey's hips.) Let's take this into high gear (She pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)

Joey: uh uh!

Rachel: Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!

Joey: No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!

Rachel: What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?

Phoebe: Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?

Monica: I have nothing to say to you.

Amanda: (announces more to herself than anyone else) Wow, my flat is twice this size!

Chandler: Well, aren't you a treat.

[Scene: The hallway]

Monica: I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?

Phoebe: It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.

Monica: I'm still all those things!

Phoebe: You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!

Monica: (starts smiling) I am scrappy.

Phoebe: Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.

Monica: It's because I'm scrappy.

Phoebe: Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.

Monica: I won't know what I would do without you.

(They hug)

Monica: Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.

Phoebe: Yeah, I guess you're right.

(They both enter the apartment again, where Amanda is "dancing" for Chandler, but she's really terrible at it)

Amanda: Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training.

[Scene: A different spray-on tan center]

(Glenda, who works here, and Ross are walking to the room with the spray-on tan booth.)
Glenda: Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and...

Ross: I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.

Glenda: (quietly) Okay...

(Ross enters the room, takes off his robe and enters the booth. He stands with his back to the nozzles and then realises that this booth has nozzles at both sides of the wall)

Ross: Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?

(He turns around frantically from side to side.)

Ross: Which... which... which... Which one is it?

(He then stops turning, facing one of the nozzles, which starts spraying in this face and front again.)

Ross: OH! SON OF A BITCH!

Joey: I don't know.

(Chandler enters the apartment)

Chandler: That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!

Rachel: Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?

Chandler: Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...

Rachel: No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...

Joey: Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?

Chandler: Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.

(Rachel and Joey are still looking at Chandler, slowly letting his words get to them)

Chandler: I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)

Rachel: Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.

Joey: Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.

Rachel: Right, totally.

Joey: Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.

Rachel: Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.

Joey: That's a... pla-an.

(They both stare for a while, and then look at each other)

Joey: (sighs) Wow... I did not see this coming.

Rachel: I know.

Joey: I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.

Rachel: Hmmm... Me too...

(She puts her head on Joey's shoulder and Joey kisses her on her head.)

Rachel: I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?

Joey: I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.

(Lifts her head from Joey's shoulder)

Rachel: Aah... I bet you're right.

(They look at each other for a while)

Joey: So...

Rachel: Yeah.

Joey: I love ya.

Rachel: Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.

Joey: Yeah, me too.

Ross: Well... I like how you look, what are you?

Assistant: Puerto Rican.

Ross: Two, I think a two.

Assistant: You've got to face the red light. When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes. When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?

Joey: Ok. Well, how, how can we make it easier?

Rachel: Ok, letâs work from the top down! (Joey nods, but then puzzled because he does not get it) Just work the bra, Joe!

Joey: Ok, yeah, got it.

Rachel and Joey: Okay.

(They start kissing and Joey starts to undo her bra, but fails completely)

Joey: This thing welded shut?!

Joey: All right, turn around, I got to get a look at this thing.

Rachel: Oh!

(Joey starts trying to undo her bra, but it wonât go.The elastic band snaps back, hurting Rachel.)

Rachel: Ow!

Joey: Sorry!

Rachel: Well this is romantic!

Joey: I'm sorry! (He stands up) This never happened to me before! I'm an expert at taking off bras! I can do it with one hand! I can do it with my eyes closed! One time I just looked at one, and it popped open! I blame your bra!

Rachel: Itâs a standard issue bra clasp!

Joey: Then I blame you! Yeah! That's right! You threw me off with all your slapping!

Rachel: Ok well, well I'm really, I'm sorry about that Joey, but do you think that maybe on some level, you don't want to take off my bra?

Joey: (contemplates for a few moments what Rachel just said) NAH! I don't have another level!!

Ross: I went to that tanning place your wife suggested.

Chandler: Was that place... The Sun?

Ross: Oh! And it gets worse! (Turns his side to Chandler and Monica and pulls up his shirt. There's a distinct line across his body, where his belly is very tanned and his back is very pale.)

Chandler: Oh My God! You can do a duet of Ebony and Ivory all by yourself!

Monica: How could you mess this up? It's so easy? You go into the booth, you count to five and you turn around!!

Ross: (looks at her suspiciously) How do you count to five?

Monica: One Two Three...

Ross: (Yells) Damnit! (Goes to the door to leave. Rachel just enters, sees him and starts laughing)

Rachel: (laughing) oooh! Oh oh!

Ross: (Still yelling) I Know!

Rachel: oh oh! What is up with Miss Hawaiian Tropic?

Chandler: How was your date with Joey?

Rachel: Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!

Chandler: You didn't like that?

Rachel: Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!

Monica: Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.

(Chandler starts looking at her bra)

Rachel: I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.

Monica: Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.

Rachel: (looking thoughtful) Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!

(Joey walks in)

Joey: Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second (points to the hall).

Rachel: (To Joey) No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through (At which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment).

Monica: Is Amanda here yet?

Phoebe: No.

Monica: (sits down) Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.

Phoebe: Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?

Monica: Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?

Phoebe: (makes a face) Are you kidding, I love it!

Amanda: (To Monica) Hello!

(Monica holds her hands out for a hug, but instead of hugging her, Amanda hangs her purse on one of Monica's extended arms.)

Amanda: (In a fake British accent) It's so nice to see you! Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! (gives her coat to Monica as well) Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch my abs (at which point she grabs both Phoebe and Monica's hands and places them both on her stomach) I don't exercise at all! (she pulls them down to sit.) Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married!

Monica: (beaming) Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...

Amanda: (To Phoebe) Smell my neck! (Phoebe does so) It's not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent!

(Monica looks shocked)

Phoebe: Musty!

Amanda: Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!

Monica: When were we not friends?

Amanda: Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was the year I had sex with Evil Knievel (She starts laughing very proudly).

Monica: Ehm, we were friends in 1992.

Amanda: (to Phoebe) No I distinctly remember you were dodging her (points at Monica) calls and trying to avoid seeing her.

Monica: (To Phoebe) You were going to cut me out?

Phoebe: Well...kinda.

Monica: Oh My God!

Amanda: Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like a perfect arse!

Phoebe: Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass".

(Monica's mobile starts ringing. She picks it up.)

Monica: (Into the phone) Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? (She listens) Oh my God, are you alright? (listens some more) Yeah, I'll be right there. (She hangs up and speaks to Amanda) I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident. (She gets up)

Joey: Uh! (When she's done she throws her bra at him)

Rachel: Ok (starts to light some candles) Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey, clearly very excited) Alright! Lets do it!

Joey: Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.

Rachel: Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! (She pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You like that huh?

Joey: Oh! yeah!

Rachel: You like that? (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively, putting her knees next to Joey's hips.) Let's take this into high gear (She pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)

Joey: uh uh!

Rachel: Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!

Joey: No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!

Rachel: What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?

(Phoebe and Amanda walk in)

Phoebe: Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?

Monica: I have nothing to say to you.

Amanda: (announces more to herself than anyone else) Wow, my flat is twice this size!

(They both walk to the door and enter the hallway.)

Amanda: Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly.

Chandler: Well, aren't you a treat.

[Scene: The hallway]

Monica: I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?

Phoebe: It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.

Monica: I'm still all those things!

Phoebe: You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!

Monica: (starts smiling) I am scrappy.

Phoebe: Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.

Monica: It's because I'm scrappy.

Phoebe: Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.

Monica: I won't know what I would do without you.

(They hug)

Monica: Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.

Phoebe: Yeah, I guess you're right.

(They both enter the apartment again, where Amanda is "dancing" for Chandler, but she's really terrible at it)

Amanda: Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training.

[Scene: A different spray-on tan center]

(Glenda, who works here, and Ross are walking to the room with the spray-on tan booth.)
Glenda: Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and...

Ross: I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.

Glenda: (quietly) Okay...

(Ross enters the room, takes off his robe and enters the booth. He stands with his back to the nozzles and then realises that this booth has nozzles at both sides of the wall)

Ross: Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?

(He turns around frantically from side to side.)

Ross: Which... which... which... Which one is it?

(He then stops turning, facing one of the nozzles, which starts spraying in this face and front again.)

Ross: OH! SON OF A BITCH!

Joey: I don't know.

(Chandler enters the apartment)

Chandler: That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!

Rachel: Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?

Chandler: Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...

Rachel: No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...

Joey: Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?

Chandler: Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.

(Rachel and Joey are still looking at Chandler, slowly letting his words get to them)

Chandler: I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)

Rachel: Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.

Joey: Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.

Rachel: Right, totally.

Joey: Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.

Rachel: Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.

Joey: That's a... pla-an.

(They both stare for a while, and then look at each other)

Joey: (sighs) Wow... I did not see this coming.

Rachel: I know.

Joey: I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.

Rachel: Hmmm... Me too...

(She puts her head on Joey's shoulder and Joey kisses her on her head.)

Rachel: I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?

Joey: I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.

(Lifts her head from Joey's shoulder)

Rachel: Aah... I bet you're right.

(They look at each other for a while)

Joey: So...

Rachel: Yeah.

Joey: I love ya.

Rachel: Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.

Joey: Yeah, me too.

(Rachel gets up, and Joey tries to get up, but halfway up he sits down again.)

Ross: Well... I like how you look, what are you?

Assistant: Puerto Rican.

Ross: Two, I think a two.

Assistant: You've got to face the red light. When the red light goes on the spraying is about to start so close your eyes. When the spraying stops, count to five. Pat yourself down to avoid drip marks then turn around so we can get your back. Got it?

Rachel: Well, it was good.. until we got back to our apartment, and then we were fooling around and he started to put his hand up my leg and I kept slapping it away!

Chandler: You didn't like that?

Rachel: Well, it wasn't just me, alright? He freaked out too! He couldn't even undo my bra!

Monica: Wow, really? One time he just looked at my bra and it popped open.

(Chandler starts looking at her bra)

Rachel: I do not know what's wrong with us, I mean, we have kissed before and that's been great! But this time it was leading somewhere and I was very aware of the fact that it was Joey touching me.

Monica: Well, you guys have been friends forever. Remember the first time that you kissed Ross? How weird that was? You couldn't stop laughing? You got through that.

Rachel: (looking thoughtful) Ok, that's true. That's true, we can do this. You're right, you're right, we can do this. We're just gonna power through!

(Joey walks in)

Joey: Hey Chandler can I talk to you for a second (points to the hall).

Rachel: (To Joey) No need!! Problem solved, we are powering through (At which point she grabs his hand and pulls him back to their apartment).

(Chandler resumes staring at Monica's bra)

Monica: (sees what he is doing) Chandler, stop! It is not going to pop open!

Chandler: (without taking his eyes off the bra) You don't know! (Monica just smiles)
[Scene: Central Perk.]

(Phoebe is sitting on the couch. Monica walks in.)
Monica: Hey Phoebe!

Phoebe: Hey!

Monica: Is Amanda here yet?

Phoebe: No.

Monica: (sits down) Oh good. Good, look I'm so sorry, for screwing up that cutting-her-out plan. But I have a new plan. Chandler agreed to call here in a few minutes with an emergency.

Phoebe: Oh! Well, what kind of emergency that gets us both out of here?

Monica: Well, what do you think of Mike and Chandler being in a car accident?

Phoebe: (makes a face) Are you kidding, I love it!

(A blonde woman walks in. Supposedly Amanda)

Phoebe: Hi!

Monica: Hi!

Amanda: Hi! (Phoebe and Amanda hug)

Amanda: (To Monica) Hello!

(Monica holds her hands out for a hug, but instead of hugging her, Amanda hangs her purse on one of Monica's extended arms.)

Amanda: (In a fake British accent) It's so nice to see you! Both of you! Look at me. Look how young I look! (gives her coat to Monica as well) Oh gosh! We have so much to catch up on! But first things first: touch my abs (at which point she grabs both Phoebe and Monica's hands and places them both on her stomach) I don't exercise at all! (she pulls them down to sit.) Oh gosh, so Monica, you're married!

Monica: (beaming) Yeah! Yeah! His name is Chandler and...

Amanda: (To Phoebe) Smell my neck! (Phoebe does so) It's not perfume! It's me! It's my natural scent!

(Monica looks shocked)

Phoebe: Musty!

Amanda: Oh! Gosh! This is brilliant. Gosh, it's just like old times. I'm so happy you two are friends again!

Monica: When were we not friends?

Amanda: Well, it was 1992, and I remember because that was the year I had sex with Evil Knievel (She starts laughing very proudly).

Monica: Ehm, we were friends in 1992.

Amanda: (to Phoebe) No I distinctly remember you were dodging her (points at Monica) calls and trying to avoid seeing her.

Monica: (To Phoebe) You were going to cut me out?

Phoebe: Well...kinda.

Monica: Oh My God!

Amanda: Oh! Bugger. Should I not have said that? I feel like a perfect arse!

Phoebe: Yeah well, in America you're just an "ass".

(Monica's mobile starts ringing. She picks it up.)

Monica: (Into the phone) Hello? Chandler, what's wrong? (She listens) Oh my God, are you alright? (listens some more) Yeah, I'll be right there. (She hangs up and speaks to Amanda) I'm so sorry, but Chandler was in a car accident. (She gets up)

Phoebe: (Also gets up and starts taking her purse) Oh my God. Was Mike with him?

Monica: Nope! (She turns and leaves)
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.]

(Joey comes running in.)
Joey: (To Rachel) Hey!

Rachel: Hey! Got champagne?

Joey: Yes ma'am, ready to Power through!

Rachel: Excellent! Stick it in the ice bucket, the phone is off the hook, and in the interest of powering through (Starts to remove her bra from under her clothes)...

Joey: Uh! (When she's done she throws her bra at him)

Rachel: Ok (starts to light some candles) Sexy, sexy, very sexy, sexy. (Claps her hands and jumps at Joey, clearly very excited) Alright! Lets do it!

Joey: Ok, you're scaring me a little bit.

Rachel: Oh! Get over it soldier, we've gotta do this! (She pulls him towards her and throws him onto the barcalounger) Ok. Aha! You like that huh?

Joey: Oh! yeah!

Rachel: You like that? (She climbs on the barcalounger seductively, putting her knees next to Joey's hips.) Let's take this into high gear (She pulls the barcalounger lever and seat reclines. She puts one of her knees between his legs and begins to kiss his neck.)

Joey: uh uh!

Rachel: Yeah baby, I'll show you how we do it!

Joey: No, no, no! You kneed me in my misters!

Rachel: What? Oh my God! I'm so sorry. Joey? Are you ok?

Joey: (He just sits there, legs very close together with a painful look on his face) Soldier down!
[Monica and Chandlers apartment.]

(Chandler is sitting on the couch reading. Monica walks in.)
Monica: We are not friends with Phoebe anymore.

Chandler: If she asks, I protested a little, but ok!

(Phoebe and Amanda walk in)

Phoebe: Oh Chandler! Thank God you're alive. Monica, can I talk to you outside for a minute?

Monica: I have nothing to say to you.

Amanda: (announces more to herself than anyone else) Wow, my flat is twice this size!

Phoebe: Please, Monica? In the hall?

(They both walk to the door and enter the hallway.)

Amanda: Ooh, that accident must have been terrible. You look positively ghastly.

Chandler: Well, aren't you a treat.

[Scene: The hallway]

Monica: I can't believe you tried to cut me out. Why Phoebe, why?

Phoebe: It was right after we were living together and you were driving me crazy, okay? You were really controlling and compulsive and shrill.

Monica: I'm still all those things!

Phoebe: You're also so generous and kind and scrappy!

Monica: (starts smiling) I am scrappy.

Phoebe: Exactly! Look, no matter what I tried to do, I couldn't keep you out of my life. Of all the people I have cut out, you were the only one who ever clawed her way back in.

Monica: It's because I'm scrappy.

Phoebe: Yeah, you are. And I'm so glad that you fought your way back in, because I don't know what I would do without you.

Monica: I won't know what I would do without you.

(They hug)

Monica: Well, I guess we should go back in. When you gave me another chance, I guess we should do the same for Amanda.

Phoebe: Yeah, I guess you're right.

(They both enter the apartment again, where Amanda is "dancing" for Chandler, but she's really terrible at it)

Amanda: Can you believe it. I've never had any professional dance training.

(Monica and Phoebe look at each other and leave the apartment again)
[Scene: A different spray-on tan center]

(Glenda, who works here, and Ross are walking to the room with the spray-on tan booth.)
Glenda: Now, let me explain how this works. You go into the booth, and...

Ross: I'm gonna stop you right there, Glenda. Okay? Does it look like this is my first time, huh? Now I want 4 two's... and I want them all on my back.

Glenda: (quietly) Okay...

(Ross enters the room, takes off his robe and enters the booth. He stands with his back to the nozzles and then realises that this booth has nozzles at both sides of the wall)

Ross: Wait a minute, there's two sets of nozzles, which one is it?

(He turns around frantically from side to side.)

Ross: Which... which... which... Which one is it?

(He then stops turning, facing one of the nozzles, which starts spraying in this face and front again.)

Ross: OH! SON OF A BITCH!

(He now turns to the other side, which also starts spraying his face and front.)
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's]

(Joey and Rachel are both sitting on the couch. Joey keeping his knees pressed against each other)
Rachel: What is the matter with us?

Joey: Well, I know what's the matter with me.

Rachel: No, I mean with us, you know. I mean, is it supposed to be this... difficult?

Joey: I don't know.

(Chandler enters the apartment)

Chandler: That fake British woman is a real bitch, but she sure can dance... Hey!

Rachel: Hi! Hey, listen, can we ask you a question? When you and Monica first hooked up, was it weird going from friends to... more than that?

Chandler: Kinda... you know, sneaking around, having to hide from you guys...

Rachel: No, no, no... No, I mean... se-x-u-ally...

Joey: Yeah, was there a part of you that... felt like it was... really wrong?

Chandler: Actually, no. No, it felt right. You know, it felt like uhm... I can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.

(Rachel and Joey are still looking at Chandler, slowly letting his words get to them)

Chandler: I can tell from your expressions that that's the good news you were hoping for... Well, I'm gonna go continue to... spread the joy.(Chandler leaves the apartment. Joey sighs)

Rachel: Well, just because it happened that way for them doesn't mean it has to happen that way for us.

Joey: Yeah, yeah... Absolutely. I mean, just because something's difficult doesn't mean that you quit.

Rachel: Right, totally.

Joey: Yeah, so we just keep trying and trying until we... do it.

Rachel: Yeah, and if doesn't work, then we'll be just one of those couples that never have sex.

Joey: That's a... pla-an.

(They both stare for a while, and then look at each other)

Joey: (sighs) Wow... I did not see this coming.

Rachel: I know.

Joey: I don't get it. I mean, I was so sure this was what I wanted.

Rachel: Hmmm... Me too...

(She puts her head on Joey's shoulder and Joey kisses her on her head.)

Rachel: I wonder how Monica and Chandler could do it?

Joey: I guess they weren't as good friends as we are.

(Lifts her head from Joey's shoulder)

Rachel: Aah... I bet you're right.

(They look at each other for a while)

Joey: So...

Rachel: Yeah.

Joey: I love ya.

Rachel: Love you too... Alright, I'm going to bed.

Joey: Yeah, me too.

(Rachel gets up, and Joey tries to get up, but halfway up he sits down again.)

Joey: Ooh, yeah, I'm not going anywhere for a while.

(Joey takes the ice-bucket with the champagne bottle in it and puts it on his sore spot)

Chandler: Dude, it's Chandler. Let me in.

(Ross's face is now a VERY dark shade of brown.)

Ross: Go away! I don't want to see anybody.

Chandler: I know, I went to the tanning place and the same thing happened to me. You have to let me in.

Ross: Really? Did you count Mississipily?

(Ross walks to the door and opens it.)

Ross: Dude, you're not tanned.

[Scene: Central Perk]

Monica: (she enters) Hey guys!

Ross, Rachel and Chandler: Hey!

Chandler: Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.

Monica: That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!

Rachel: Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!

Ross: Yeah!

Rachel: We're having a party.

Monica: Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?

Ross: No.

Rachel: No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!

Chandler: Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!

Ross: C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.

Monica: Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.

Chandler: There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...

Rachel: Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?

Ross: Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.

Rachel: And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!

Monica: All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.

Chandler: Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...

Monica: Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!

OPENING CREDITS
[Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment]

Rachel: You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.

Phoebe: Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!

Ross: (he enters) Hey guys!

Rachel and Phoebe: Hi!

Ross: Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.

Rachel: Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.

Phoebe: Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!

Ross: Yeah!

Phoebe: Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!

Ross: That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?

Rachel: Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.

Ross: Ah, and where is Joey?

Rachel: I said it's still nap time.

(Joey comes out from his room, yawning)

Ross: (taping Joey with the cam) Hey, there is uncle Joey!

Joey: Hey!

Ross: Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!

Joey: 18, uh? (starts to prepare himself to say his "How You Doin'" line)

Ross: Joey, NO!

Joey: What, what!? it's for her hot friends!

Ross: When they see this you'll be 52!

Joey: And starting to think about settling down!

Rachel: Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?

Joey: I'd love to! Yeah!

Joey: (To Phoebe) We were supposed to bring presents?

Phoebe: Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.

Joey: Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?

Phoebe: Joey, it's a birthday party.

Joey: Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says "El-moo"! (Joey starts laughing) Yeah... that's a funny cup!

(Monica and Chandler enter)

Monica: Hey!

Chandler: Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?

Rachel: Oh, she's still napping

Chandler: Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.

Rachel: Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.

Monica: All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!

Rachel: No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.

Monica: Are you freaking kidding me, Green?

(someone knocks on the door. Rachel goes to open it)

Jack and Judy: HI!

Ross: (points the camcorder towards them to record their entrance) Hey!

Monica: So glad you came!

Jack: I can't believe Emma is already one!

Judy: (to Monica) I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to take him to the emergency room!

Ross: (pointing the camcorder at himself) There's something you didn't know about your dad!

Joey: Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.

Jack: Thank you!

Joey: Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!

Jack: Which one are you?
(Time lapse)

Monica: I can't believe Emma is still asleep!

Chandler: I know, what are we gonna do?

Monica: I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!

Chandler: I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!

Joey: Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!

Phoebe: So youâre gonna... hit on her?

Joey: No, no, no! My talents as an actor!

Phoebe: Oh!

Joey: You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!

Phoebe: Or you could stick a fork in an apple!

Joey: Hey, I think Emma might like it!

Rachel: Oh! Emma might like what?

Joey: Um, my present!

Rachel: What did you get her?

Joey: Actually we prepared performances.

Phoebe: Separate performances.

Joey: But equally real!

Rachel: Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?

Phoebe: Sure, yeah!

Joey: (unconfidently) O K.

Rachel: (to everybody) All right, letâs get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.

Ross: Oh, great!

Phoebe: (to Joey) Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?

Joey: Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!

Rachel: So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?

Joey: I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emmaâs books.

Rachel: Oh, ok, which one?

Joey: Uh, why, itâs a... (he picks a book up) one of her favorites, uh, (he reads the title of the book) âRiding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depressionâ eesh! (he puts the book back and picks up another) âLove you foreverâ. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed (he pauses and changes the tone to a dramatic one) in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang âIâll love you forever, Iâll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby youâll beâ. (the picture fades and Joey is now finishing the book). And while he rocked her, he sang âIâll love you forever, Iâll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby youâll beâ.

Rachel: (crying) Wow! That was amazing!

Ross: Thank you so much for that gift!

Chandler (nearly weeping): I was not ready for this today!

Ross: Amazing... amazing.

Rachel: Oh, Phoebe, Iâm sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.

Phoebe: Thatâs right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For thereâs no greater gift, than the gift of music. (she starts singing) Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!

Rachel: Is that it?

Phoebe: No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading (she picks up a book). âSex and the single mother. (pause) Finding your G-spot.

Everybody: No, no, no, no, no!

[Scene: Joeyâs Apartment. Ross is filming his parents ]

Judy: Hello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday.

Jack: Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years.

Judy: Yes, youâll be all grown up by then. Weâll be... Well your grandfather and I might not be here.

Jack: Thatâs true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the grave, Emma!

Judy: After all, my parents died very young.

Jack: And my cholesterolâs off the charts!

Judy: Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!

Ross (stops recording): Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!

Rachel: Ross, um, donât forget to get a shot of Emmaâs cake. Itâs in a box in the fridge.

Ross: Sure.

Rachel: Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corinoâs.

Monica: Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.

Rachel: Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, theyâll copy it in icing!

Monica: Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?

Rachel: Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.

Ross: Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?

Rachel: Ross, what are you talking about? (she sees the cake) oh! Oh my God! They put my babyâs face on a penis!

Phoebe (sees the cake): oh! Now itâs a party!

Rachel: Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!

Joey (staring at the cake): Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?

Judy:(to Jack) Jack, look at this.

Jack: I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!

Ross: I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.

Rachel (on the phone): No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughterâs birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!

Ross: Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the babyâs face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. (pause). That is a weird sentence!

Rachel: Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home... (Turns towards the cake and sees Joey trying to take a piece and yells at him) Joey, don't touch it!!

Joey: I'm so confused!

Rachel: (speaking to the person on the phone again) Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!

Chandler: To be fair this one does have nuts.

(Time lapse)

(Ross, Chandler and Monica are in the kitchen area)

Ross: Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.

Monica: Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!

Ross: Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? (takes the camcorder and points it at Monica and Chandler) Ok!

Chandler: Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?

Monica: We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!

Chandler: We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. (Ross looks disappointed and switches the camcorder off)

Monica: Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.

Phoebe: And you know, I have a massage client soon.

Ross: You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?

Monica: Alright, 5 more minutes.

(The phone rings, Ross picks up)

Ross: (Into receiver) Hello? (listens) Oh no! What happened? (listens some more) Ok ok, where are you? (Grabs a pen and starts writing). Ok, I'll be right there. (Puts the phone down)

Chandler: Was that Emma? Is she up?

Ross: No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.

Phoebe: Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.

Monica: No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us (Points at herself and Chandler) We've been complaining the longest!

Ross: No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?

Chandler: I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!

Ross: Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves! (leaves)

Joey: Got it! (Goes towards the front door and stands with his back to it) Hey hey hey! (to Chandler) Where do you think you're going?

Chandler: To the bathroom!

Joey: Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li...(stops and thinks) Wait a minute, there is a window in there!

Phoebe: Oh no! He's not getting away that easy! (Phoebe and Joey run towards the bathroom and enter)

Chandler: (Yelling) What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! (Phoebe and Joey come out looking shocked)

Joey: Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.

Phoebe: No, it did not.

Joey: No.

Judy: Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.

Jack: Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime.

Judy: Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.

Joey: Ok! (Opens the door for them)

Judy: Bye... Bye dear.

Joey: Nighty-night!

Judy: Nighty-night!

Joey: Bye, bye.

Phoebe: Joey? How could you just let them leave?

Joey: Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country.

Monica: No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.

Joey: (Shocked) Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in. (turns the bolts of the door, thereby locking it)

Chandler: You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?

Joey: Oh! I forgot you used to live here!

(The phone rings, Joey picks up)

Joey: Hello?

Estelle: (on the other side of the line) Joey! It's Estelle!

Joey: Hey! (smiles)

Estelle: So, how did your audition go today?

Joey: (smile fades) What audition?

Estelle: The one I told you about last week?

Joey: What? You never said anything about an audition!

Estelle: (Looks confused) Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition. I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to have a monologue prepared.

Joey: A monologue? I don't have.. (sees the book he was reading before for his "dramatic reading") I got it. (hangs up) (announces to the room) Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!

Phoebe: Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!

Monica: Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!

Phoebe: Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!

Monica: No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.

Joey: Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.

Monica: (She gives Joey a you-are-so-stupid-look) Ok, ten.

Joey: Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?

Phoebe: No, lets just draw straws.

Joey: Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..

Chandler: I'm begging you stop.

Joey: Right.

Monica: Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!

Phoebe: (Visibly excited) Yeah!! Let's do that!

Chandler: (Also very excited) That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!

Monica: Everybody get your toys! (They all run toward the table with toys)

Phoebe: Ok! I want the dolphin!

Chandler: Thats a bear.

Phoebe: I'm too excited!

Monica: Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go (Takes two cups and marks the start and finish lines with them) from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!

Joey: Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys! (they do so)

Chandler: Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!

(Monica, Phoebe and Joey release their wind-up toys.)

Phoebe: Go! Go!

Joey: Come on robot!

(Phoebe's bear takes the lead, followed by Joey's robot, and far behind is Chandler and Monica's dog, which walks a few paces, stops and starts barking, sits, walks again, and so on... )

Monica: (to the dog) What are you barking at?

(While Phoebe's bear is still in the lead, it is now closely followed by Joey's robot. Chandler and Monica's dog however, sits down, barking... and does a backflip.)

Monica: Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?

Chandler: I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?

(Meanwhile the race has been won by Phoebe's bear, followed by Joey's robot)

Joey: Way to go robot!

Phoebe: Good job Alan!

Joey: Hey, good race you guys.

Phoebe: Yeah, see you later!

(Joey and Phoebe leave for the door)

Monica: No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. (turns to Chandler) The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...

Chandler: They left.

(Monica turns to see the closed door.)
[ Scene: The freeway. Rachel is driving Monica's Porsche, while using her mobile phone. Ross is sitting next to her.]


Rachel: (into the phone) No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can. (emotionally) Bye...

(She hangs up, closes her phone, turns around and puts it in her bag which is in the back of the car. While doing this and not looking at the road, she turns the steering wheel by accident, which makes the car swerve.)

Ross: RACHEL!

Rachel: OOH! God! Sorry!

Ross: (sarcastically) I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.

(Ross fastens his seat belt.)

Rachel: Emma's awake.

Ross: Yeah?

Rachel: I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.

Ross: Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else. (he opens the box)

Rachel: Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.

Ross: Rach, she's not going to remember this.

Rachel: (shakes her head) I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! (honks furiously, and Ross looks at her in disbelief and Rachel looks at him.) They have to learn!

Ross: (looks back at the cake) Hey!

Rachel: What?

Ross: It's not bad.

Rachel: (she looks at the cake) Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?

Ross: Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.

Rachel: Well, I'm very impressed.

Ross: Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
[ Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment. Chandler, Monica and Emma are sitting on the floor, and Emma's stuffed animals are lined up in front of them.]


Monica: Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.

Chandler: I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?

Monica: Game?

Chandler: Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.

(With his index finger he shows her how old she is. Emma also points her finger and babbles...)

Chandler: Ooh! That's my girl!

Monica: That's how old you are.

Chandler: Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?

Monica: (embraces Emma tightly) Ooh, I want one...

Chandler: Me too...

(There's a couple of seconds of silence. Then Chandler looks around...)

Chandler: There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?

Monica: ...and head to Canada!

Chandler: I was kidding.

Monica: I wasn't. Let's get going!

(Phoebe enters the apartment again.)

Phoebe: Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?

Chandler: No, not yet.

Phoebe: Oh good, I didn't miss the party.

Monica: What about your massage client?

Phoebe: I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.

(Joey comes running into the apartment, out of breath.)

Joey: Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!

(Ross and Rachel enter.)

Joey: (to Ross and Rachel) I've been here the whole time!

Ross: Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.

Rachel: I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!

Chandler: Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.

Rachel: What?

Chandler: Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? (holds up his index finger again)

Emma: Wo-ish. (and holds up her finger)

(Ross and Rachel gasp)

Rachel: Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!

Ross: Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...

Rachel: (angrily) NO, no science camp!

Ross: Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.

Rachel: Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!

Monica: Thanks!

Ross: Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.

Chandler: Let's do it, come on!

(Rachel wipes away some tears.)

Ross: What's wrong? Are you okay?

Rachel: Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.

Phoebe: (pointing at cake) Hey, you made it into a bunny.

Joey: What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.
ENDING CREDITS
[Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment. It's just Ross and Rachel. They put the camera on a tripod in the kitchen and they are standing in front of the camera.]

Rachel: Okay.

Ross: Okay, you ready?

Rachel: Yeah.

Ross: A-a-and... record.

Rachel: Okay. (they both look into the camera, and Ross waves.) Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...

[Scene: Central Perk]

Monica: (she enters) Hey guys!

Ross, Rachel and Chandler: Hey!

Chandler: Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.

Monica: That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!

Rachel: Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!

Ross: Yeah!

Rachel: We're having a party.

Monica: Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?

Ross: No.

Rachel: No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!

Chandler: Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!

Ross: C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.

Monica: Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.

Chandler: There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...

Rachel: Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?

Ross: Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.

Rachel: And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!

Monica: All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.

Chandler: Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...

Monica: Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!

OPENING CREDITS
[Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment]

Rachel: You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.

Phoebe: Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!

Ross: (he enters) Hey guys!

Rachel and Phoebe: Hi!

Ross: Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.

Rachel: Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.

Phoebe: Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!

Ross: Yeah!

Phoebe: Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!

Ross: That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?

Rachel: Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.

Ross: Ah, and where is Joey?

Rachel: I said it's still nap time.

(Joey comes out from his room, yawning)

Ross: (taping Joey with the cam) Hey, there is uncle Joey!

Joey: Hey!

Ross: Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!

Joey: 18, uh? (starts to prepare himself to say his "How You Doin'" line)

Ross: Joey, NO!

Joey: What, what!? it's for her hot friends!

Ross: When they see this you'll be 52!

Joey: And starting to think about settling down!

Rachel: Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?

Joey: I'd love to! Yeah!

Joey: (To Phoebe) We were supposed to bring presents?

Phoebe: Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.

Joey: Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?

Phoebe: Joey, it's a birthday party.

Joey: Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says "El-moo"! (Joey starts laughing) Yeah... that's a funny cup!

(Monica and Chandler enter)

Monica: Hey!

Chandler: Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?

Rachel: Oh, she's still napping

Chandler: Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.

Rachel: Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.

Monica: All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!

Rachel: No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.

Monica: Are you freaking kidding me, Green?

(someone knocks on the door. Rachel goes to open it)

Jack and Judy: HI!

Ross: (points the camcorder towards them to record their entrance) Hey!

Monica: So glad you came!

Jack: I can't believe Emma is already one!

Judy: (to Monica) I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to take him to the emergency room!

Ross: (pointing the camcorder at himself) There's something you didn't know about your dad!

Joey: Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.

Jack: Thank you!

Joey: Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!

Jack: Which one are you?
(Time lapse)

Monica: I can't believe Emma is still asleep!

Chandler: I know, what are we gonna do?

Monica: I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!

Chandler: I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!

Joey: Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!

Phoebe: So youâre gonna... hit on her?

Joey: No, no, no! My talents as an actor!

Phoebe: Oh!

Joey: You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!

Phoebe: Or you could stick a fork in an apple!

Joey: Hey, I think Emma might like it!

Rachel: Oh! Emma might like what?

Joey: Um, my present!

Rachel: What did you get her?

Joey: Actually we prepared performances.

Phoebe: Separate performances.

Joey: But equally real!

Rachel: Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?

Phoebe: Sure, yeah!

Joey: (unconfidently) O K.

Rachel: (to everybody) All right, letâs get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.

Ross: Oh, great!

Phoebe: (to Joey) Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?

Joey: Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!

Rachel: So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?

Joey: I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emmaâs books.

Rachel: Oh, ok, which one?

Joey: Uh, why, itâs a... (he picks a book up) one of her favorites, uh, (he reads the title of the book) âRiding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depressionâ eesh! (he puts the book back and picks up another) âLove you foreverâ. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed (he pauses and changes the tone to a dramatic one) in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang âIâll love you forever, Iâll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby youâll beâ. (the picture fades and Joey is now finishing the book). And while he rocked her, he sang âIâll love you forever, Iâll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby youâll beâ.

Rachel: (crying) Wow! That was amazing!

Ross: Thank you so much for that gift!

Chandler (nearly weeping): I was not ready for this today!

Ross: Amazing... amazing.

Rachel: Oh, Phoebe, Iâm sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.

Phoebe: Thatâs right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For thereâs no greater gift, than the gift of music. (she starts singing) Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!

Rachel: Is that it?

Phoebe: No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading (she picks up a book). âSex and the single mother. (pause) Finding your G-spot.

Everybody: No, no, no, no, no!

[Scene: Joeyâs Apartment. Ross is filming his parents ]

Judy: Hello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday.

Jack: Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years.

Judy: Yes, youâll be all grown up by then. Weâll be... Well your grandfather and I might not be here.

Jack: Thatâs true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the grave, Emma!

Judy: After all, my parents died very young.

Jack: And my cholesterolâs off the charts!

Judy: Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!

Ross (stops recording): Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!

Rachel: Ross, um, donât forget to get a shot of Emmaâs cake. Itâs in a box in the fridge.

Ross: Sure.

Rachel: Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corinoâs.

Monica: Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.

Rachel: Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, theyâll copy it in icing!

Monica: Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?

Rachel: Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.

Ross: Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?

Rachel: Ross, what are you talking about? (she sees the cake) oh! Oh my God! They put my babyâs face on a penis!

Phoebe (sees the cake): oh! Now itâs a party!

Rachel: Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!

Joey (staring at the cake): Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?

Judy:(to Jack) Jack, look at this.

Jack: I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!

Ross: I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.

Rachel (on the phone): No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughterâs birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!

Ross: Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the babyâs face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. (pause). That is a weird sentence!

Rachel: Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home... (Turns towards the cake and sees Joey trying to take a piece and yells at him) Joey, don't touch it!!

Joey: I'm so confused!

Rachel: (speaking to the person on the phone again) Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!

Chandler: To be fair this one does have nuts.

(Time lapse)

(Ross, Chandler and Monica are in the kitchen area)

Ross: Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.

Monica: Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!

Ross: Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? (takes the camcorder and points it at Monica and Chandler) Ok!

Chandler: Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?

Monica: We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!

Chandler: We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. (Ross looks disappointed and switches the camcorder off)

Monica: Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.

Phoebe: And you know, I have a massage client soon.

Ross: You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?

Monica: Alright, 5 more minutes.

(The phone rings, Ross picks up)

Ross: (Into receiver) Hello? (listens) Oh no! What happened? (listens some more) Ok ok, where are you? (Grabs a pen and starts writing). Ok, I'll be right there. (Puts the phone down)

Chandler: Was that Emma? Is she up?

Ross: No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.

Phoebe: Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.

Monica: No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us (Points at herself and Chandler) We've been complaining the longest!

Ross: No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?

Chandler: I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!

Ross: Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves! (leaves)

Joey: Got it! (Goes towards the front door and stands with his back to it) Hey hey hey! (to Chandler) Where do you think you're going?

Chandler: To the bathroom!

Joey: Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li...(stops and thinks) Wait a minute, there is a window in there!

Phoebe: Oh no! He's not getting away that easy! (Phoebe and Joey run towards the bathroom and enter)

Chandler: (Yelling) What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! (Phoebe and Joey come out looking shocked)

Joey: Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.

Phoebe: No, it did not.

Joey: No.

Judy: Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.

Jack: Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime.

Judy: Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.

Joey: Ok! (Opens the door for them)

Judy: Bye... Bye dear.

Joey: Nighty-night!

Judy: Nighty-night!

Joey: Bye, bye.

Phoebe: Joey? How could you just let them leave?

Joey: Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country.

Monica: No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.

Joey: (Shocked) Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in. (turns the bolts of the door, thereby locking it)

Chandler: You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?

Joey: Oh! I forgot you used to live here!

(The phone rings, Joey picks up)

Joey: Hello?

Estelle: (on the other side of the line) Joey! It's Estelle!

Joey: Hey! (smiles)

Estelle: So, how did your audition go today?

Joey: (smile fades) What audition?

Estelle: The one I told you about last week?

Joey: What? You never said anything about an audition!

Estelle: (Looks confused) Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition. I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to have a monologue prepared.

Joey: A monologue? I don't have.. (sees the book he was reading before for his "dramatic reading") I got it. (hangs up) (announces to the room) Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!

Phoebe: Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!

Monica: Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!

Phoebe: Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!

Monica: No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.

Joey: Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.

Monica: (She gives Joey a you-are-so-stupid-look) Ok, ten.

Joey: Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?

Phoebe: No, lets just draw straws.

Joey: Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..

Chandler: I'm begging you stop.

Joey: Right.

Monica: Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!

Phoebe: (Visibly excited) Yeah!! Let's do that!

Chandler: (Also very excited) That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!

Monica: Everybody get your toys! (They all run toward the table with toys)

Phoebe: Ok! I want the dolphin!

Chandler: Thats a bear.

Phoebe: I'm too excited!

Monica: Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go (Takes two cups and marks the start and finish lines with them) from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!

Joey: Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys! (they do so)

Chandler: Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!

(Monica, Phoebe and Joey release their wind-up toys.)

Phoebe: Go! Go!

Joey: Come on robot!

(Phoebe's bear takes the lead, followed by Joey's robot, and far behind is Chandler and Monica's dog, which walks a few paces, stops and starts barking, sits, walks again, and so on... )

Monica: (to the dog) What are you barking at?

(While Phoebe's bear is still in the lead, it is now closely followed by Joey's robot. Chandler and Monica's dog however, sits down, barking... and does a backflip.)

Monica: Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?

Chandler: I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?

(Meanwhile the race has been won by Phoebe's bear, followed by Joey's robot)

Joey: Way to go robot!

Phoebe: Good job Alan!

Joey: Hey, good race you guys.

Phoebe: Yeah, see you later!

(Joey and Phoebe leave for the door)

Monica: No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. (turns to Chandler) The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...

Chandler: They left.

(Monica turns to see the closed door.)
[ Scene: The freeway. Rachel is driving Monica's Porsche, while using her mobile phone. Ross is sitting next to her.]


Rachel: (into the phone) No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can. (emotionally) Bye...

(She hangs up, closes her phone, turns around and puts it in her bag which is in the back of the car. While doing this and not looking at the road, she turns the steering wheel by accident, which makes the car swerve.)

Ross: RACHEL!

Rachel: OOH! God! Sorry!

Ross: (sarcastically) I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.

(Ross fastens his seat belt.)

Rachel: Emma's awake.

Ross: Yeah?

Rachel: I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.

Ross: Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else. (he opens the box)

Rachel: Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.

Ross: Rach, she's not going to remember this.

Rachel: (shakes her head) I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! (honks furiously, and Ross looks at her in disbelief and Rachel looks at him.) They have to learn!

Ross: (looks back at the cake) Hey!

Rachel: What?

Ross: It's not bad.

Rachel: (she looks at the cake) Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?

Ross: Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.

Rachel: Well, I'm very impressed.

Ross: Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
[ Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment. Chandler, Monica and Emma are sitting on the floor, and Emma's stuffed animals are lined up in front of them.]


Monica: Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.

Chandler: I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?

Monica: Game?

Chandler: Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.

(With his index finger he shows her how old she is. Emma also points her finger and babbles...)

Chandler: Ooh! That's my girl!

Monica: That's how old you are.

Chandler: Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?

Monica: (embraces Emma tightly) Ooh, I want one...

Chandler: Me too...

(There's a couple of seconds of silence. Then Chandler looks around...)

Chandler: There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?

Monica: ...and head to Canada!

Chandler: I was kidding.

Monica: I wasn't. Let's get going!

(Phoebe enters the apartment again.)

Phoebe: Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?

Chandler: No, not yet.

Phoebe: Oh good, I didn't miss the party.

Monica: What about your massage client?

Phoebe: I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.

(Joey comes running into the apartment, out of breath.)

Joey: Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!

(Ross and Rachel enter.)

Joey: (to Ross and Rachel) I've been here the whole time!

Ross: Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.

Rachel: I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!

Chandler: Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.

Rachel: What?

Chandler: Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? (holds up his index finger again)

Emma: Wo-ish. (and holds up her finger)

(Ross and Rachel gasp)

Rachel: Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!

Ross: Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...

Rachel: (angrily) NO, no science camp!

Ross: Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.

Rachel: Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!

Monica: Thanks!

Ross: Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.

Chandler: Let's do it, come on!

(Rachel wipes away some tears.)

Ross: What's wrong? Are you okay?

Rachel: Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.

Phoebe: (pointing at cake) Hey, you made it into a bunny.

Joey: What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.
ENDING CREDITS
[Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment. It's just Ross and Rachel. They put the camera on a tripod in the kitchen and they are standing in front of the camera.]

Rachel: Okay.

Ross: Okay, you ready?

Rachel: Yeah.

Ross: A-a-and... record.

Rachel: Okay. (they both look into the camera, and Ross waves.) Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...

[Scene: Central Perk]

Monica: (she enters) Hey guys!

Ross, Rachel and Chandler: Hey!

Chandler: Honey, I got us that room at the Woodford Inn this weekend.

Monica: That place in Vermont? You can take a hint!

Rachel: Wait, you can't go away this weekend! It's Emma's birthday!

Ross: Yeah!

Rachel: We're having a party.

Monica: Well, can't you just have the party when we get back?

Ross: No.

Rachel: No, that day... that won't be her real birthday!

Chandler: Gee if only she were one and had no idea what the hell a birthday was!

Ross: C'mon you guys, this is really important to us.

Monica: Well, I'm sorry, but Chandler and I could really use a weekend away. You know, to reconnect... emotionally.

Chandler: There's this thing I really want us to do. I read about it in Maxim...

Rachel: Well, can't you just go to Vermont the next day?

Ross: Yeah, we want everyone to be there. As much as I hate to delay your doing weird sex stuff to my little sister.

Rachel: And I mean, you know, you guys... This is a big deal. I mean, how can we have her first birthday party without her aunt and her uncle!

Monica: All right, we'll stay. We can just drive up after the party.

Chandler: Fine, but if we end up not doing this Maxim thing because of this party...

Monica: Believe me, that is not why we won't be doing that!

OPENING CREDITS
[Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment]

Rachel: You know Pheebs, when I was little, on my birthday, my daddy would hide a present in every room of the house, and then he would draw a treasure map to help me find 'em all.

Phoebe: Oooh, I love family traditions like that. When uhm... when Ursula and I were kids, on our birthday, our stepdad would sell his blood to buy us food!

Ross: (he enters) Hey guys!

Rachel and Phoebe: Hi!

Ross: Hey, I brought the camera for Emma's video.

Rachel: Oh, good, good! We had this idea to make a birthday video for Emma and we'll give it to her when she is 18.

Phoebe: Oh, COOL!! Wow, it's like a time capsule!

Ross: Yeah!

Phoebe: Oh, just think... she's gonna be watching that video on a TV that hasn't even been invented yet! With friends who right now are just like babies! And they'll be living in a floating city that the humans built to escape the ant people!

Ross: That's the hope! So, is Emma awake yet?

Rachel: Oh no, it's still nap time. But she'll be up soon.

Ross: Ah, and where is Joey?

Rachel: I said it's still nap time.

(Joey comes out from his room, yawning)

Ross: (taping Joey with the cam) Hey, there is uncle Joey!

Joey: Hey!

Ross: Hey, say something to Emma on her 18th birthday!

Joey: 18, uh? (starts to prepare himself to say his "How You Doin'" line)

Ross: Joey, NO!

Joey: What, what!? it's for her hot friends!

Ross: When they see this you'll be 52!

Joey: And starting to think about settling down!

Rachel: Hey Joey, will you please set this up for people to put Emma's presents on?

Joey: I'd love to! Yeah!

Joey: (To Phoebe) We were supposed to bring presents?

Phoebe: Yeah! I wrote Emma a song.

Joey: Oh, yeah! How was I supposed to know?

Phoebe: Joey, it's a birthday party.

Joey: Yeah, but for a one-year-old. What's the point... the other day she laughed for like an hour at a cup. Just a cup with a picture of Elmo on it dressed as a farmer. And he's standing next to this cow and the cow says "El-moo"! (Joey starts laughing) Yeah... that's a funny cup!

(Monica and Chandler enter)

Monica: Hey!

Chandler: Hey hey! Where's the birthday girl?

Rachel: Oh, she's still napping

Chandler: Oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party she knows is happening.

Rachel: Look, I know that you guys really want to get to Vermont and this isn't a really big deal to you, but it really is to us, ok? Emma will never have a first birthday again.

Monica: All right... you're right. We're sorry. Now let's wake up Emma and get the fun time started!

Rachel: No really, she didn't sleep well last night, so we can't wake her up.

Monica: Are you freaking kidding me, Green?

(someone knocks on the door. Rachel goes to open it)

Jack and Judy: HI!

Ross: (points the camcorder towards them to record their entrance) Hey!

Monica: So glad you came!

Jack: I can't believe Emma is already one!

Judy: (to Monica) I remember your first birthday! Ross was jealous of all the attention we were giving you. He pulled on his testicles so hard! We had to take him to the emergency room!

Ross: (pointing the camcorder at himself) There's something you didn't know about your dad!

Joey: Hey Mr. and Mrs. Geller! Let me help you with that.

Jack: Thank you!

Joey: Oh man, this is great, uh? The three of us together again! You know what would be fun? If we gave this present to Emma from all of us!

Jack: Which one are you?
(Time lapse)

Monica: I can't believe Emma is still asleep!

Chandler: I know, what are we gonna do?

Monica: I've got a plan. I've got a plan. I'm going to ram this platter really hard into your ribs. You're gonna scream out and that'll wake her up!

Chandler: I'm not going to Vermont with this Monica!

Joey: Hey Pheebs, you know what? I was thinking... since you wrote a song, maybe I could do something for Emma using my talents!

Phoebe: So youâre gonna... hit on her?

Joey: No, no, no! My talents as an actor!

Phoebe: Oh!

Joey: You know, I could like maybe... I could do a dramatic reading of one of her books!

Phoebe: Or you could stick a fork in an apple!

Joey: Hey, I think Emma might like it!

Rachel: Oh! Emma might like what?

Joey: Um, my present!

Rachel: What did you get her?

Joey: Actually we prepared performances.

Phoebe: Separate performances.

Joey: But equally real!

Rachel: Well, this sounds like fun! Well, you know what? Actually? People are getting a little antsy waiting Emma to wake up from her nap, so would you mind performing them once now?

Phoebe: Sure, yeah!

Joey: (unconfidently) O K.

Rachel: (to everybody) All right, letâs get this party started, huh? Joey and Phoebe are gonna perform a little something for us.

Ross: Oh, great!

Phoebe: (to Joey) Are you gonna be embarrassed going up there having nothing prepared?

Joey: Hey, I do it every week with three cameras pointed at me and a whole crew waiting!

Rachel: So, Joey, what are you gonna do for us?

Joey: I will be doing a dramatic reading of one of Emmaâs books.

Rachel: Oh, ok, which one?

Joey: Uh, why, itâs a... (he picks a book up) one of her favorites, uh, (he reads the title of the book) âRiding the Storm Out. Coping with post-partum depressionâ eesh! (he puts the book back and picks up another) âLove you foreverâ. Love you forever. By Robert Munsch. Published by Firefly books. Printed (he pauses and changes the tone to a dramatic one) in Mexico. A mother held her new baby and very slowly rocked him back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, and while she held him she sang âIâll love you forever, Iâll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby youâll beâ. (the picture fades and Joey is now finishing the book). And while he rocked her, he sang âIâll love you forever, Iâll like you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby youâll beâ.

Rachel: (crying) Wow! That was amazing!

Ross: Thank you so much for that gift!

Chandler (nearly weeping): I was not ready for this today!

Ross: Amazing... amazing.

Rachel: Oh, Phoebe, Iâm sorry! Phoebe has prepared something as well.

Phoebe: Thatâs right, I've prepared a song for Emma. From my heart to hers. For thereâs no greater gift, than the gift of music. (she starts singing) Emma! Your name poses a dilemma. 'Cause not much else rhymes with Emma! Maybe the actor Richard Crenna, he played the commanding officer in Rambo. Happy birthday Emma!

Rachel: Is that it?

Phoebe: No, of course not! I also, you know, prepared a reading (she picks up a book). âSex and the single mother. (pause) Finding your G-spot.

Everybody: No, no, no, no, no!

[Scene: Joeyâs Apartment. Ross is filming his parents ]

Judy: Hello Emma. Happy eighteenth birthday.

Jack: Right now that seems so far away, seventeen years.

Judy: Yes, youâll be all grown up by then. Weâll be... Well your grandfather and I might not be here.

Jack: Thatâs true! This message could becoming to you from beyond the grave, Emma!

Judy: After all, my parents died very young.

Jack: And my cholesterolâs off the charts!

Judy: Remember, Emma, heart disease kills women too!

Ross (stops recording): Ok, cut! Great. That was... that was just... yeah!

Rachel: Ross, um, donât forget to get a shot of Emmaâs cake. Itâs in a box in the fridge.

Ross: Sure.

Rachel: Oh, you're gonna love this cake. I got it from a bakery in New Jersey, Corinoâs.

Monica: Oh my God, that place has the creamiest frosting! I use to hitchhike there when I was a kid.

Rachel: Well, anyway, they make these great novelty cakes, in all different shapes, and if you give them a photo, theyâll copy it in icing!

Monica: Oh, did you do a picture of Emma?

Rachel: Yes! On a cake shaped like a bunny.

Ross: Uh, Rach? Does this bakery by any chance also bake erotic cakes? Say for bachelorette parties?

Rachel: Ross, what are you talking about? (she sees the cake) oh! Oh my God! They put my babyâs face on a penis!

Phoebe (sees the cake): oh! Now itâs a party!

Rachel: Why you guys this isn't funny, all right? If I wanted this cake to be a disaster I would have baked it myself!

Joey (staring at the cake): Uh.. is it ok that I still think it looks delicious?

Judy:(to Jack) Jack, look at this.

Jack: I know what you're thinking Judy, the resemblance is uncanny!

Ross: I am this close to tugging on my testicles again.

Rachel (on the phone): No, no, this is not what I ordered. Ok? I went all the way to New Jersey so that I could have the perfect cake for my daughterâs birthday and I need a bunny cake, right now!

Ross: Ask them if it would be faster if we cut the babyâs face off the penis, so we can put it on the bunny. (pause). That is a weird sentence!

Rachel: Oh! Believe you me! I am going to bring this cake back, I don't even want it in my home... (Turns towards the cake and sees Joey trying to take a piece and yells at him) Joey, don't touch it!!

Joey: I'm so confused!

Rachel: (speaking to the person on the phone again) Yes, yes. I still want my daughters picture, but on a bunny cake. Yellow cake, chocolate frosting with nuts!

Chandler: To be fair this one does have nuts.

(Time lapse)

(Ross, Chandler and Monica are in the kitchen area)

Ross: Hey Mon, that was really nice of you to loan Rachel your car so she could go and get the cake.

Monica: Oh. So nice of her to pull my hair, 'till I dropped the key!

Ross: Well, you know what? While we're waiting, you guys could tape your message to Emma for her 18th birthday, huh? (takes the camcorder and points it at Monica and Chandler) Ok!

Chandler: Hi Emma! It's the year 2020. Are you still enjoying your nap?

Monica: We're Aunt Monica and uncle Chandler, by the way. You may not recognize us, because we haven't spoken to your parents in seventeen years!

Chandler: We used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together and things kind of unraveled. Because of you! Happy Birthday. (Ross looks disappointed and switches the camcorder off)

Monica: Ross, Rachel promised it would be over by now. We seriously have to go, if we want to get to Vermont. I called them and the last train leaves in a half hour.

Phoebe: And you know, I have a massage client soon.

Ross: You guys, just please.. a little bit longer. I promise, Rachel will be back with the cake any minute. Monica, remember.. the frosting? huh?

Monica: Alright, 5 more minutes.

(The phone rings, Ross picks up)

Ross: (Into receiver) Hello? (listens) Oh no! What happened? (listens some more) Ok ok, where are you? (Grabs a pen and starts writing). Ok, I'll be right there. (Puts the phone down)

Chandler: Was that Emma? Is she up?

Ross: No, Rachel got pulled over for speeding. She forgot her licence so now I have to bring it to her.

Phoebe: Well, if you're leaving, I'm definitely gonna go.

Monica: No! Wait! If anybody gets to go.. it's us (Points at herself and Chandler) We've been complaining the longest!

Ross: No, wait ! You guys, no, no, you can't leave! Rachel already feels bad that the cake's messed up. How do you think she's gonna feel when she comes back here and all you guys are gone?

Chandler: I don't know! You'll tell us on Monday!

Ross: Joey! You're in charge, ok? You make sure nobody leaves! (leaves)

Joey: Got it! (Goes towards the front door and stands with his back to it) Hey hey hey! (to Chandler) Where do you think you're going?

Chandler: To the bathroom!

Joey: Alright, well the rest of you get comfortable, ok, because we're gonna be here for a li...(stops and thinks) Wait a minute, there is a window in there!

Phoebe: Oh no! He's not getting away that easy! (Phoebe and Joey run towards the bathroom and enter)

Chandler: (Yelling) What are you doing? Get the hell out of here! (Phoebe and Joey come out looking shocked)

Joey: Well, that one did not have Emma's face on it.

Phoebe: No, it did not.

Joey: No.

Judy: Well, we better get going, it's late. Jack's not allowed to drive at night anymore. He has trouble staying in his lane.

Jack: Last winter I went up on a church lawn and drove right through a manger scene. The papers thought it was a hate crime.

Judy: Anyway, it was lovely seeing you.

Joey: Ok! (Opens the door for them)

Judy: Bye... Bye dear.

Joey: Nighty-night!

Judy: Nighty-night!

Joey: Bye, bye.

Phoebe: Joey? How could you just let them leave?

Joey: Hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm not gonna mess with Jack, he's a great man, he fought for our country.

Monica: No, he didn't! He pretended to be a Quaker to get out of Korea.

Joey: (Shocked) Oh! Well that's it! He's the last one to go. I'm locking you guys in. (turns the bolts of the door, thereby locking it)

Chandler: You do know, I can just turn them the other way around, right?

Joey: Oh! I forgot you used to live here!

(The phone rings, Joey picks up)

Joey: Hello?

Estelle: (on the other side of the line) Joey! It's Estelle!

Joey: Hey! (smiles)

Estelle: So, how did your audition go today?

Joey: (smile fades) What audition?

Estelle: The one I told you about last week?

Joey: What? You never said anything about an audition!

Estelle: (Looks confused) Let me start over. I just got a call about an audition. I think you can still make it. It's down at the Astor Theatre and you need to have a monologue prepared.

Joey: A monologue? I don't have.. (sees the book he was reading before for his "dramatic reading") I got it. (hangs up) (announces to the room) Aah! so... I'm gonna take off!

Phoebe: Wh.. what? No wait, you don't get to leave! I've got a massage client waiting outside my door any minute!

Monica: Yeah, and we've paid for a room, that we're supposed to be in right now!

Phoebe: Well, oh, ok now... Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!

Monica: No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.

Joey: Oh! I got it! Ok, everyone pick a number from one to ten. Alright? Whoever gets the highest number gets to go first.

Monica: (She gives Joey a you-are-so-stupid-look) Ok, ten.

Joey: Okay, Monica picks ten, I call nine! Anyone else?

Phoebe: No, lets just draw straws.

Joey: Or.. we could flip a coin, and then multiply the..

Chandler: I'm begging you stop.

Joey: Right.

Monica: Ok, how about this: We got wind up toys for Emma for her birthday. We can make them race, and whoever comes in last, stays!

Phoebe: (Visibly excited) Yeah!! Let's do that!

Chandler: (Also very excited) That sounds more fun than the thing we were going to do in Vermont!

Monica: Everybody get your toys! (They all run toward the table with toys)

Phoebe: Ok! I want the dolphin!

Chandler: Thats a bear.

Phoebe: I'm too excited!

Monica: Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog. Ok, and the race is going to go (Takes two cups and marks the start and finish lines with them) from here to here. Now the one who comes in last, stays!

Joey: Ok, ladies and gentlemen, wind your toys! (they do so)

Chandler: Ok, on your mark... Get set... GO!!!

(Monica, Phoebe and Joey release their wind-up toys.)

Phoebe: Go! Go!

Joey: Come on robot!

(Phoebe's bear takes the lead, followed by Joey's robot, and far behind is Chandler and Monica's dog, which walks a few paces, stops and starts barking, sits, walks again, and so on... )

Monica: (to the dog) What are you barking at?

(While Phoebe's bear is still in the lead, it is now closely followed by Joey's robot. Chandler and Monica's dog however, sits down, barking... and does a backflip.)

Monica: Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?

Chandler: I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?

(Meanwhile the race has been won by Phoebe's bear, followed by Joey's robot)

Joey: Way to go robot!

Phoebe: Good job Alan!

Joey: Hey, good race you guys.

Phoebe: Yeah, see you later!

(Joey and Phoebe leave for the door)

Monica: No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. (turns to Chandler) The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...

Chandler: They left.

(Monica turns to see the closed door.)
[ Scene: The freeway. Rachel is driving Monica's Porsche, while using her mobile phone. Ross is sitting next to her.]


Rachel: (into the phone) No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can. (emotionally) Bye...

(She hangs up, closes her phone, turns around and puts it in her bag which is in the back of the car. While doing this and not looking at the road, she turns the steering wheel by accident, which makes the car swerve.)

Ross: RACHEL!

Rachel: OOH! God! Sorry!

Ross: (sarcastically) I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.

(Ross fastens his seat belt.)

Rachel: Emma's awake.

Ross: Yeah?

Rachel: I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.

Ross: Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else. (he opens the box)

Rachel: Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.

Ross: Rach, she's not going to remember this.

Rachel: (shakes her head) I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing "Happy Birthday". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! (honks furiously, and Ross looks at her in disbelief and Rachel looks at him.) They have to learn!

Ross: (looks back at the cake) Hey!

Rachel: What?

Ross: It's not bad.

Rachel: (she looks at the cake) Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?

Ross: Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.

Rachel: Well, I'm very impressed.

Ross: Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.
[ Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment. Chandler, Monica and Emma are sitting on the floor, and Emma's stuffed animals are lined up in front of them.]


Monica: Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.

Chandler: I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?

Monica: Game?

Chandler: Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.

(With his index finger he shows her how old she is. Emma also points her finger and babbles...)

Chandler: Ooh! That's my girl!

Monica: That's how old you are.

Chandler: Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?

Monica: (embraces Emma tightly) Ooh, I want one...

Chandler: Me too...

(There's a couple of seconds of silence. Then Chandler looks around...)

Chandler: There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?

Monica: ...and head to Canada!

Chandler: I was kidding.

Monica: I wasn't. Let's get going!

(Phoebe enters the apartment again.)

Phoebe: Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?

Chandler: No, not yet.

Phoebe: Oh good, I didn't miss the party.

Monica: What about your massage client?

Phoebe: I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.

(Joey comes running into the apartment, out of breath.)

Joey: Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!

(Ross and Rachel enter.)

Joey: (to Ross and Rachel) I've been here the whole time!

Ross: Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.

Rachel: I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!

Chandler: Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.

Rachel: What?

Chandler: Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? (holds up his index finger again)

Emma: Wo-ish. (and holds up her finger)

(Ross and Rachel gasp)

Rachel: Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!

Ross: Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...

Rachel: (angrily) NO, no science camp!

Ross: Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.

Rachel: Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!

Monica: Thanks!

Ross: Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.

Chandler: Let's do it, come on!

(Rachel wipes away some tears.)

Ross: What's wrong? Are you okay?

Rachel: Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.

Phoebe: (pointing at cake) Hey, you made it into a bunny.

Joey: What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.
ENDING CREDITS
[Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment. It's just Ross and Rachel. They put the camera on a tripod in the kitchen and they are standing in front of the camera.]

Rachel: Okay.

Ross: Okay, you ready?

Rachel: Yeah.

Ross: A-a-and... record.

Rachel: Okay. (they both look into the camera, and Ross waves.) Hi Emma. Well, your first birthday is over, and it was really...

(There's a lot of yelling and screaming coming from the hallway, and they get up to look at what's the noise all about. In the hallway, Monica, Chandler, Joey and Phoebe are having another wind-up animal race, yelling and screaming fanatically.)

Phoebe: (yelling at the top of her voice) Go, go, go Alan! Run you, hairy bastard!
end

Rachel: You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.

Joey: Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!

Rachel: I've never given her a cookie. Have you?

Joey: No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!

Monica: Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.

Rachel: Of course, I'd be honored!

Chandler: Thanks!

Monica: Thank you!

(Joey looks at them, disappointed about their decision)

Joey: U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.

Chandler: Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.

Monica: Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with the words".

Joey: Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!

Monica: Clearly we were wrong.

Joey: I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.

Monica: You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.

Joey: Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby adoption decider people..."

Chandler: So excited about your letter!

(Phoebe enters)

Phoebe: Hey!

All: Hey Phoebe!

Joey: Hey!

Monica: Wow! Don't you look nice?!

Phoebe: Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.

Rachel: OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...

Phoebe: YEAH!

Chandler: So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?

Phoebe: Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.

Joey: Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?

Phoebe: Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.

Monica: You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!

Chandler: That's where people make number two!!


OPENING CREDITS
[Scene: Ross' apartment. Ross is grading papers. Charlie approaches him.]

 

Charlie: Hey! (They kiss and cuddle a little)

Ross: Hey...

Charlie: So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to...

Ross: (surprised) Oh... (he pauses) (sounds disappointed) Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.

Charlie: Fine, it's fine... (she whispers) I'll just shower by myself...

Ross: (Writing on the papers) B, B, B, B, B!

Charlie: Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.

Ross: Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.

(they start kissing but someone knocks at the door)

Ross: Damnit!

Amy: (yelling from outside) Rachel!! Open up!! It's your sister!! (she knocks on the door again) I have to talk to you!!

Ross: (he opens the door) Hi Amy!

Amy: You're not Rachel.

Ross: Still sharp as a tack!

Amy: Um... Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy. Amy, this is Charlie.

Charlie: Hi!

Amy: Hi!

Charlie: Nice to meet you.

Amy: H-Hi!!(to Ross) And you are...?

Ross: (pause) Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!

Amy: (looks confused) N-no... uhm... did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?

Ross: (gives up) Yes, yes, you did.

 

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment]

 

(Ross enters the apartment with Amy)

Ross: Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!

Rachel: Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! (they hug) Wow! You remember Joey?

Amy: Yeah! Hey, sure! The "Days of Our Lives" guy!

Joey: That's right, yeah.

Amy: You're not good!

Joey: Always nice to meet a fan!

Rachel: So now, what are you doing here?

Amy: Well, I have huge news.

Rachel: (Emma starts crying in the other room) Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!

Amy: Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait? (Rachel goes to Emma)

Ross: Ehm... Her name is Emma.

Amy: Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier!

Ross: What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!

Amy: Hey, your English is getting better!!

Ross: (to Joey) Oh my God!

Joey: I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.

Ross: What... what you working on?

Joey: (using a laptop) Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...

Ross: Why don't you use your Thesaurus?

Joey: What did I just say?

Ross: Watch. (he takes the laptop) Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change.
Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.

Joey: Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... (he uses the Thesaurus) "brainy, bright, clever", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!

 

[Scene: Rachel's room. Rachel is attending to Emma. Amy is standing behind her.]

 

Rachel: God!

Amy: So beautiful.

Rachel: Oh, I know, isn't she?

Amy: No, I was talking about your bedding.

Rachel: All right. What's your news, Amy?

Amy: Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married.

Rachel: What? Oh my God! To who?

Amy: This guy! He has a killer apartment.

Rachel: A-And??

Amy: A-And it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room.

Rachel: No, what's he like?

Amy: Oh! He's ok. Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark?

Rachel: Yeah.

Amy: It's his dad.

Rachel: Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...

Amy: Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.

Rachel: Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...

Amy: Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old!

Rachel: Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didnât love. Do you remember Barry?

Amy: Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.

Rachel: Sometimes just nodding is ok. (pause) Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!

Amy: (thinks about it) Youâre right, youâre right! Iâm gonna do it!

Rachel: Ok.

Amy: Iâm gonna marry Myron and keep looking for Mr Right.

Rachel: Ok, letâs keep talking.

 

[Scene: Madison Square Garden. Mike and Phoebe are walking to their seats.]

 

Phoebe: Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. (looking at her ticket). Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... theyâre in my seat. It's my anniversary. (to Mike) Here we are! (Mike nods). Canât believe it's been a whole year!

Mike: I know. This has been the best year... (the crowd starts cheering so he starts yelling) THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE!

Phoebe: ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!

Mike: I FEEL THE SAME WAY!

Phoebe: YOUâRE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND (crowd stops cheering) YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) ITâS OUR ANNIVERSARY!

Announcer: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask. (on the screen thereâs written âJulie, will you marry me?â and goes on to show a guy kneeling down in front of a girl holding out a ring to her)

Phoebe: Oh how lame... oh, itâs so tacky, and impersonal.

Mike: Really?

Phoebe: Oh, itâs the worst way to propose!

Mike: (looks strangely shocked) Excuse me... (he leaves, then Phoebe realizes what she did).

 

[Scene: Monicaâs apartment. Joey enters the room]

 

Joey: Hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to Chandler) Here. And I think youâll be very, very happy. Itâs the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.

Chandler: (reading) I donât... uh... understand.

Joey: (sounding very proud of himself) Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?

Monica: (also reading it) It doesnât make any sense.

Joey: Of course it does! Itâs smart! I used the the-saurus!

Chandler: On every word?

Joey: Yep!

Monica: Alright, what was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence to Joey)

Joey: Oh, âThey are warm, nice, people with big heartsâ.

Chandler: And that became âthey are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?

Joey: Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.

Monica: Hey Joey, I donât think we can use this.

Joey: Why not?

Monica: Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani (Joey makes a 'and-whatâs-wrong-with-that' look). Hey, why donât you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!

Chandler: You know what? You donât need a thesaurus, just write from here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.

 

[Scene: The corridor. Amy knocks Joeyâs door and Rachel opens the door.]

 

Rachel: Amy, hi!

Amy: I took your advice, I left Myron.

Rachel: Oh, good for you!

Amy: I know! I'm Erin Brockovich!

Rachel: Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!

Amy: Thank you! So, can I stay with you?

Rachel: But Erin Brockovich had her own house.

(Joey comes out of Monicaâs apartment and sees Rachel and Amy but does not notice the huge amount of bags)

Joey: Ah, look whoâs back! (he sees the bags) Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?

Amy: Well, Iâm staying with you guys!

Joey: What?

Amy: Weâre gonna be roomies! (she snaps her finger and points at Joey, snaps her fingers again and points to the bags) Come on!

 

[Scene: Joeyâs apartment. Rachel is in the living room and Joey comes out of his room.]

 

Joey: You slept out here?

Rachel: Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling âMyron, get off!â

Joey: But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me weâre getting rid of her.

Rachel: Joey, I canât do that!

Joey: Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said (aping Amy badly) "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!" I donât need that kind of talk in my house!

Rachel: Well Joey, uhm look, I know that sheâs difficult, but I think itâs really good that sheâs here.

Joey: 'Cause we will appreciate it more when sheâs gone?

Rachel: No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.

Joey: Yeah, Monica made us!

Rachel: Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I donât think I would be the person that I am today if it wasnât for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know itâs gonna take patience, but thatâs ok.

Amy: Good morning.

Joey: Yeaah.

Rachel: Amy, thatâs what I was supposed to wear today, thatâs why I hung it on the door.

Amy: Oh, sweety, you canât pull this off.

Rachel: Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.

Amy: Oh, I canât, honey. Iâm gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. (points at her eyebrows) I am not happy. (to Joey who has a pizza box in his hands) Oh... sure you wanna eat that?

Joey: (yelling at her) IâM CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!

 

[Scene: Monicaâs Apartment. Rachel, Ross, Monica and Chandler are there, Phoebe enters the room]

 

Phoebe: Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.

Chandler: I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.

Monica: Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.

Ross: Seriously?

Chandler: Word!

Phoebe: Well, mine was worse than that.

Rachel: Well, what happened?

Phoebe: We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...

Rachel: Oh, that is so tacky.

Phoebe: Well, thatâs what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!

Monica: Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?

Rachel: Phoebe, thatâs huge!

Ross: Well, do you wanna marry him?

Phoebe: Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I donât think heâs ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!

Chandler: She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a guy..?

Monica: Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!

Phoebe: Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?

Monica: I proposed to Chandler! (Phoebe stops herself from laughing) Alright, moving on...

Chandler: Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!

Monica: Thank you.

Phoebe: (To Rachel and Ross) Well, do you think I should propose?

Rachel: I think it could be kind of great!

Ross: Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!

Phoebe: Ok, ok, so how should I do it?

Monica: How about at a game, on the big screen?

Rachel: (Sarcastically) Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? (claps her hands together, faking excitement)

Monica: What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!

Phoebe: Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two (points to Ross and Chandler) like that?

Chandler: Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?

(Amy walks in carrying a phone handset)

Amy: (To Rachel) Nana is on the phone (Hands the phone over to Rachel)

Rachel: (Takes the phone) Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!

Amy: She did? Who got her condo in Boca?

Rachel: (Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh, it's our nanny! (goes back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! (Hangs up) (To Ross) That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?

Ross: No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?

Rachel: Menstrual cramps.

Ross: I don't think that's what this is.

Rachel: (To Monica, Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma?

Monica: No, sorry sweety..

Phoebe: No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..

Rachel: (To Ross) Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?

Amy: Well, I can do it.

Rachel: (Thinks for a moment) Well, actually...

Ross: (He interrupts her immediately, and drags her by her arm to the other side of the room) Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?

Rachel: Yeah.

Ross: Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.

Rachel: Why not?

Ross: Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!

Rachel: (Defends Amy) Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!

Ross: Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.

Rachel: (Shocked) Wha... the next one?

Ross: (a little confused) Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.

Rachel: Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!

Ross: I... I don't know..

Rachel: Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows (points at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?

(Amy approaches from behind)

Amy: um... listen, I couldn't help but overhear... 'cause I was trying to... Listen, let me do this alright? I really wanna help you guys out, and plus Rachel's been so wonderful to me... (looks at hem pleadingly)

(Rachel looks at Ross and her agrees silently)

Rachel: Absolutely.

Amy: (very excited) Oh! Great! So how much does it pay? (Ross just gives up and leaves)

 

[Scene: Central Perk. Joey is inside, Chandler and Monica walk in.]

 

Chandler: Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?

Joey: Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.

(Chandler and Monica look shocked)

Monica: You dropped it off?

Joey: Yeah.

Chandler: Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?

Joey: No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it. (Chandler and Monica look even more shocked)

Monica: You hand-wrote it?

Joey: Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later! (Leaves)

Monica: Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!

Chandler: It's ok, it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)

Monica: Okay good.

Chandler: (on the phone) Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused).

Monica: Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.

Chandler: (Still looks confused) They loved it.

Monica: What?

Chandler: They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.

Monica: (surprised) They thought Joey was a child?

Chandler: She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.

(Amy comes in with Emma in a stroller)

Amy: Hi!

Monica: Hey, what did you guys do today?

Amy: Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.

Chandler: That sounds like fun.

Amy: Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.

(Rachel comes in, sees Amy and Emma)

Rachel: (To Emma) Hey! Hi, how's my girl?

Amy: I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready?

Rachel: (sounds excited) Yeah!

(Amy takes off Emma's hat)

Amy: Ta-daaa!

(Rachel looks at Emma)

Rachel: (not excited anymore) You pierced her ears!?

Amy: (Very excited about it) Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?

(Rachel looks very shocked)

COMMERCIAL BREAK


Rachel: You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?

Amy: Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it?

Chandler: I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily) ... but I am wrong!

Rachel: Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.

Amy: Why, did something happen to his falafel cart?

Rachel: Ugh. (takes the hat and covers Emma's head and half her face with it)

(Ross enters)

Ross: Hey guys.

Monica and Chandler: Hi Ross.

Ross: Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. (Wants to take the hat off, but Rachel tries to stop him).

Rachel: Nah, I don't really want her to see.

Ross: Why not?

Monica: Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.

Chandler: Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?

Ross: Come here (Removes Emma's hat) Oh! There she is! Hi!

(Rachel looks worried)

Ross: (sees how strangely Monica, Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What?

Rachel: Nothing.

Ross: (Back to Emma) Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away from him so he can get a better look at her. He looks at her confused. Finally he realizes the difference and gasps). Please tell me those are clip-ons.

Rachel: Oh, they're real!

Ross: Did she (points at Amy) do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!

Rachel: I know, I know, and you were right Ross. (To Amy) You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!

Amy: Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs to have a cool fun aunt!

Monica: I'm a cool, fun aunt!

Amy: (Sarcastically) O-Okay!

Chandler: Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!

Rachel: I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?

Amy: Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going to do with my life.

Rachel: Oh yeah? Since when?

Amy: Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist.

Rachel: (looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief) What?

Ross: That's not a thing!

Amy: Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what colors to wear, what clothes are slimming...

Rachel: (shouting) Babies don't care if they're slim.

Amy: Enter Amy!

Ross: (very angry) Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...

Amy: What? What are you gonna do?

Ross: (pointing at Amy, shouting) No more falafel for you!

(Amy looks at Ross, angrily. Rachel clearly doesn't understand what he meant and looks at Ross who gestures "later".)

 

[Scene: Madison Square Garden. Phoebe and Mike are watching the game. There's cheering, but Phoebe seems distracted.]

 

Mike: Great game, huh?

Phoebe: Uhuh, uhuh... (seems distracted)

Mike: Why do you keep looking at the screen?

Phoebe: I'm not. I'm praying. (looking up) Please let the Knicks win... Thank you Thor! (Mike is standing up) Where... where are you going?

Mike: Going go to the bathroom.

Phoebe: Well, I think you should wait.

Mike: Why?

Phoebe: Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.

Announcer: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask.

(We see the screen where it says: "Mike will you marry me?" and then we see Phoebe and Mike on the screen. Phoebe stands up and kneels in front of Mike.)

Phoebe: Mike Hannigan... will you marry me? (Mike looks bewildered)

Announcer: Get a load of this... She's proposing to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family. (people are laughing, while Mike still seems bewildered)

Phoebe: That's not very enlightened!

(There's booing around them, and Mike sinks in his chair, holding his hand in above his eyes, hoping no-one would recognize him)

Phoebe: Hey, hey! (shouting) Boo us? Boo you!

 

[Scene: Rachel and Joey's. Joey is in the kitchen and the telephone rings.]

 

Joey: (picks up the phone) Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now... (looks puzzled) Okay, bye bye. (hangs up) (to himself) She was nice!

(Rachel and Amy enter)

Rachel: Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!

Joey: Whoo-hoo! (and leaves for Rachel's room)

Amy: You're kicking me out?

Rachel: You put holes in my baby's ears!

Amy: Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!

Rachel: (gasps) I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.

Amy: You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.

Rachel: Excuse me?

Amy: You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then, I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws (frantically pointing at her nose) And suddenly I am the bad guy?

Rachel: (yelling) Joey, where are those bags?

Joey: (Yelling from Rachel's room) She has a lot of crap!

Amy: You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great. Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without that stupid Jill... Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way...

Rachel: (doesn't believe what she's hearing) Seriously?

Amy: hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.

Rachel: Hips or thighs?

Amy: Ass and face.

Rachel: (gasps) Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.

Amy: She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking about real stuff.

Rachel: (embarrassed) Oh, I can give you that.

Amy: You can?

Rachel: Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.

Amy: (touched) Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look cute.

Rachel: Did you just say Emma?

Amy: Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella.
[Scene: Mike and Phoebe at a restaurant.]

 

Phoebe: That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.

Mike: But please, let's just forget the whole thing.

Phoebe: (the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.

(Mike's face changes from happy to sad, and he looks at the cake, disappointed.)

Phoebe: It's in the cake, isn't it?

Mike: (puts on a fake smile) Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it? (he takes the ring from the cake, and cleans it with a napkin)

Phoebe: What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

Mike: No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

(Phoebe has this weird, anxious, nervous look on her face)

Mike: I'm gonna do this now.

Phoebe: Oh my God!

(Mike starts to kneel in front of Phoebe.)

Mike: Phoebe, I...

Phoebe: Wait! Oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again, but then...) Oh no! (She was wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.)

Mike: Ready?

Phoebe: Uh-huh! (and now Mike kneels properly)

Mike: Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

Phoebe: Yes!

(Mike puts the ring on her finger)

Mike: I love you!

Phoebe: I love you more!

Mike: Not possible! (they kiss, and then Mike says proudly...) She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls.

(They kiss again, and Phoebe looks at the ring.)

COMMERCIAL BREAK

 

[Scene: The street in front of Central Perk. Rachel and Amy are walking on the sidewalk.]

 

Rachel: So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?

Amy: Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies are ugly.

Rachel: That's shocking!

Amy: Oh! It's Ross... Hey Ross! (She says hey to the guy at the falafel stand, whose only similarity with Ross would be his black hair.) Hello-oo Ross! (to Rachel) He's rude!

THE END
Rachel: You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.

Joey: Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!

Rachel: I've never given her a cookie. Have you?

Joey: No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!

Monica: Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.

Rachel: Of course, I'd be honored!

Chandler: Thanks!

Monica: Thank you!

(Joey looks at them, disappointed about their decision)

Joey: U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.

Chandler: Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.

Monica: Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with the words".

Joey: Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!

Monica: Clearly we were wrong.

Joey: I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.

Monica: You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.

Joey: Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby adoption decider people..."

Chandler: So excited about your letter!

(Phoebe enters)

Phoebe: Hey!

All: Hey Phoebe!

Joey: Hey!

Monica: Wow! Don't you look nice?!

Phoebe: Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.

Rachel: OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...

Phoebe: YEAH!

Chandler: So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?

Phoebe: Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.

Joey: Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?

Phoebe: Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.

Monica: You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!

Chandler: That's where people make number two!!


OPENING CREDITS
[Scene: Ross' apartment. Ross is grading papers. Charlie approaches him.]

 

Charlie: Hey! (They kiss and cuddle a little)

Ross: Hey...

Charlie: So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to...

Ross: (surprised) Oh... (he pauses) (sounds disappointed) Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.

Charlie: Fine, it's fine... (she whispers) I'll just shower by myself...

Ross: (Writing on the papers) B, B, B, B, B!

Charlie: Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.

Ross: Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.

(they start kissing but someone knocks at the door)

Ross: Damnit!

Amy: (yelling from outside) Rachel!! Open up!! It's your sister!! (she knocks on the door again) I have to talk to you!!

Ross: (he opens the door) Hi Amy!

Amy: You're not Rachel.

Ross: Still sharp as a tack!

Amy: Um... Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy. Amy, this is Charlie.

Charlie: Hi!

Amy: Hi!

Charlie: Nice to meet you.

Amy: H-Hi!!(to Ross) And you are...?

Ross: (pause) Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!

Amy: (looks confused) N-no... uhm... did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?

Ross: (gives up) Yes, yes, you did.

 

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment]

 

(Ross enters the apartment with Amy)

Ross: Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!

Rachel: Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! (they hug) Wow! You remember Joey?

Amy: Yeah! Hey, sure! The "Days of Our Lives" guy!

Joey: That's right, yeah.

Amy: You're not good!

Joey: Always nice to meet a fan!

Rachel: So now, what are you doing here?

Amy: Well, I have huge news.

Rachel: (Emma starts crying in the other room) Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!

Amy: Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait? (Rachel goes to Emma)

Ross: Ehm... Her name is Emma.

Amy: Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier!

Ross: What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!

Amy: Hey, your English is getting better!!

Ross: (to Joey) Oh my God!

Joey: I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.

Ross: What... what you working on?

Joey: (using a laptop) Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...

Ross: Why don't you use your Thesaurus?

Joey: What did I just say?

Ross: Watch. (he takes the laptop) Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change.
Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.

Joey: Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... (he uses the Thesaurus) "brainy, bright, clever", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!

 

[Scene: Rachel's room. Rachel is attending to Emma. Amy is standing behind her.]

 

Rachel: God!

Amy: So beautiful.

Rachel: Oh, I know, isn't she?

Amy: No, I was talking about your bedding.

Rachel: All right. What's your news, Amy?

Amy: Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married.

Rachel: What? Oh my God! To who?

Amy: This guy! He has a killer apartment.

Rachel: A-And??

Amy: A-And it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room.

Rachel: No, what's he like?

Amy: Oh! He's ok. Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark?

Rachel: Yeah.

Amy: It's his dad.

Rachel: Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...

Amy: Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.

Rachel: Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...

Amy: Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old!

Rachel: Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didnât love. Do you remember Barry?

Amy: Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.

Rachel: Sometimes just nodding is ok. (pause) Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!

Amy: (thinks about it) Youâre right, youâre right! Iâm gonna do it!

Rachel: Ok.

Amy: Iâm gonna marry Myron and keep looking for Mr Right.

Rachel: Ok, letâs keep talking.

 

[Scene: Madison Square Garden. Mike and Phoebe are walking to their seats.]

 

Phoebe: Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. (looking at her ticket). Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... theyâre in my seat. It's my anniversary. (to Mike) Here we are! (Mike nods). Canât believe it's been a whole year!

Mike: I know. This has been the best year... (the crowd starts cheering so he starts yelling) THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE!

Phoebe: ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!

Mike: I FEEL THE SAME WAY!

Phoebe: YOUâRE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND (crowd stops cheering) YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) ITâS OUR ANNIVERSARY!

Announcer: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask. (on the screen thereâs written âJulie, will you marry me?â and goes on to show a guy kneeling down in front of a girl holding out a ring to her)

Phoebe: Oh how lame... oh, itâs so tacky, and impersonal.

Mike: Really?

Phoebe: Oh, itâs the worst way to propose!

Mike: (looks strangely shocked) Excuse me... (he leaves, then Phoebe realizes what she did).

 

[Scene: Monicaâs apartment. Joey enters the room]

 

Joey: Hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to Chandler) Here. And I think youâll be very, very happy. Itâs the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.

Chandler: (reading) I donât... uh... understand.

Joey: (sounding very proud of himself) Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?

Monica: (also reading it) It doesnât make any sense.

Joey: Of course it does! Itâs smart! I used the the-saurus!

Chandler: On every word?

Joey: Yep!

Monica: Alright, what was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence to Joey)

Joey: Oh, âThey are warm, nice, people with big heartsâ.

Chandler: And that became âthey are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?

Joey: Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.

Monica: Hey Joey, I donât think we can use this.

Joey: Why not?

Monica: Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani (Joey makes a 'and-whatâs-wrong-with-that' look). Hey, why donât you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!

Chandler: You know what? You donât need a thesaurus, just write from here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.

 

[Scene: The corridor. Amy knocks Joeyâs door and Rachel opens the door.]

 

Rachel: Amy, hi!

Amy: I took your advice, I left Myron.

Rachel: Oh, good for you!

Amy: I know! I'm Erin Brockovich!

Rachel: Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!

Amy: Thank you! So, can I stay with you?

Rachel: But Erin Brockovich had her own house.

(Joey comes out of Monicaâs apartment and sees Rachel and Amy but does not notice the huge amount of bags)

Joey: Ah, look whoâs back! (he sees the bags) Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?

Amy: Well, Iâm staying with you guys!

Joey: What?

Amy: Weâre gonna be roomies! (she snaps her finger and points at Joey, snaps her fingers again and points to the bags) Come on!

 

[Scene: Joeyâs apartment. Rachel is in the living room and Joey comes out of his room.]

 

Joey: You slept out here?

Rachel: Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling âMyron, get off!â

Joey: But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me weâre getting rid of her.

Rachel: Joey, I canât do that!

Joey: Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said (aping Amy badly) "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!" I donât need that kind of talk in my house!

Rachel: Well Joey, uhm look, I know that sheâs difficult, but I think itâs really good that sheâs here.

Joey: 'Cause we will appreciate it more when sheâs gone?

Rachel: No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.

Joey: Yeah, Monica made us!

Rachel: Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I donât think I would be the person that I am today if it wasnât for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know itâs gonna take patience, but thatâs ok.

Amy: Good morning.

Joey: Yeaah.

Rachel: Amy, thatâs what I was supposed to wear today, thatâs why I hung it on the door.

Amy: Oh, sweety, you canât pull this off.

Rachel: Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.

Amy: Oh, I canât, honey. Iâm gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. (points at her eyebrows) I am not happy. (to Joey who has a pizza box in his hands) Oh... sure you wanna eat that?

Joey: (yelling at her) IâM CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!

 

[Scene: Monicaâs Apartment. Rachel, Ross, Monica and Chandler are there, Phoebe enters the room]

 

Phoebe: Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.

Chandler: I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.

Monica: Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.

Ross: Seriously?

Chandler: Word!

Phoebe: Well, mine was worse than that.

Rachel: Well, what happened?

Phoebe: We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...

Rachel: Oh, that is so tacky.

Phoebe: Well, thatâs what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!

Monica: Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?

Rachel: Phoebe, thatâs huge!

Ross: Well, do you wanna marry him?

Phoebe: Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I donât think heâs ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!

Chandler: She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a guy..?

Monica: Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!

Phoebe: Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?

Monica: I proposed to Chandler! (Phoebe stops herself from laughing) Alright, moving on...

Chandler: Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!

Monica: Thank you.

Phoebe: (To Rachel and Ross) Well, do you think I should propose?

Rachel: I think it could be kind of great!

Ross: Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!

Phoebe: Ok, ok, so how should I do it?

Monica: How about at a game, on the big screen?

Rachel: (Sarcastically) Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? (claps her hands together, faking excitement)

Monica: What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!

Phoebe: Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two (points to Ross and Chandler) like that?

Chandler: Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?

(Amy walks in carrying a phone handset)

Amy: (To Rachel) Nana is on the phone (Hands the phone over to Rachel)

Rachel: (Takes the phone) Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!

Amy: She did? Who got her condo in Boca?

Rachel: (Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh, it's our nanny! (goes back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! (Hangs up) (To Ross) That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?

Ross: No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?

Rachel: Menstrual cramps.

Ross: I don't think that's what this is.

Rachel: (To Monica, Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma?

Monica: No, sorry sweety..

Phoebe: No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..

Rachel: (To Ross) Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?

Amy: Well, I can do it.

Rachel: (Thinks for a moment) Well, actually...

Ross: (He interrupts her immediately, and drags her by her arm to the other side of the room) Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?

Rachel: Yeah.

Ross: Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.

Rachel: Why not?

Ross: Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!

Rachel: (Defends Amy) Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!

Ross: Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.

Rachel: (Shocked) Wha... the next one?

Ross: (a little confused) Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.

Rachel: Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!

Ross: I... I don't know..

Rachel: Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows (points at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?

(Amy approaches from behind)

Amy: um... listen, I couldn't help but overhear... 'cause I was trying to... Listen, let me do this alright? I really wanna help you guys out, and plus Rachel's been so wonderful to me... (looks at hem pleadingly)

(Rachel looks at Ross and her agrees silently)

Rachel: Absolutely.

Amy: (very excited) Oh! Great! So how much does it pay? (Ross just gives up and leaves)

 

[Scene: Central Perk. Joey is inside, Chandler and Monica walk in.]

 

Chandler: Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?

Joey: Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.

(Chandler and Monica look shocked)

Monica: You dropped it off?

Joey: Yeah.

Chandler: Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?

Joey: No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it. (Chandler and Monica look even more shocked)

Monica: You hand-wrote it?

Joey: Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later! (Leaves)

Monica: Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!

Chandler: It's ok, it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)

Monica: Okay good.

Chandler: (on the phone) Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused).

Monica: Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.

Chandler: (Still looks confused) They loved it.

Monica: What?

Chandler: They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.

Monica: (surprised) They thought Joey was a child?

Chandler: She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.

(Amy comes in with Emma in a stroller)

Amy: Hi!

Monica: Hey, what did you guys do today?

Amy: Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.

Chandler: That sounds like fun.

Amy: Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.

(Rachel comes in, sees Amy and Emma)

Rachel: (To Emma) Hey! Hi, how's my girl?

Amy: I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready?

Rachel: (sounds excited) Yeah!

(Amy takes off Emma's hat)

Amy: Ta-daaa!

(Rachel looks at Emma)

Rachel: (not excited anymore) You pierced her ears!?

Amy: (Very excited about it) Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?

(Rachel looks very shocked)

COMMERCIAL BREAK


Rachel: You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?

Amy: Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it?

Chandler: I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily) ... but I am wrong!

Rachel: Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.

Amy: Why, did something happen to his falafel cart?

Rachel: Ugh. (takes the hat and covers Emma's head and half her face with it)

(Ross enters)

Ross: Hey guys.

Monica and Chandler: Hi Ross.

Ross: Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. (Wants to take the hat off, but Rachel tries to stop him).

Rachel: Nah, I don't really want her to see.

Ross: Why not?

Monica: Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.

Chandler: Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?

Ross: Come here (Removes Emma's hat) Oh! There she is! Hi!

(Rachel looks worried)

Ross: (sees how strangely Monica, Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What?

Rachel: Nothing.

Ross: (Back to Emma) Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away from him so he can get a better look at her. He looks at her confused. Finally he realizes the difference and gasps). Please tell me those are clip-ons.

Rachel: Oh, they're real!

Ross: Did she (points at Amy) do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!

Rachel: I know, I know, and you were right Ross. (To Amy) You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!

Amy: Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs to have a cool fun aunt!

Monica: I'm a cool, fun aunt!

Amy: (Sarcastically) O-Okay!

Chandler: Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!

Rachel: I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?

Amy: Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going to do with my life.

Rachel: Oh yeah? Since when?

Amy: Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist.

Rachel: (looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief) What?

Ross: That's not a thing!

Amy: Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what colors to wear, what clothes are slimming...

Rachel: (shouting) Babies don't care if they're slim.

Amy: Enter Amy!

Ross: (very angry) Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...

Amy: What? What are you gonna do?

Ross: (pointing at Amy, shouting) No more falafel for you!

(Amy looks at Ross, angrily. Rachel clearly doesn't understand what he meant and looks at Ross who gestures "later".)

 

[Scene: Madison Square Garden. Phoebe and Mike are watching the game. There's cheering, but Phoebe seems distracted.]

 

Mike: Great game, huh?

Phoebe: Uhuh, uhuh... (seems distracted)

Mike: Why do you keep looking at the screen?

Phoebe: I'm not. I'm praying. (looking up) Please let the Knicks win... Thank you Thor! (Mike is standing up) Where... where are you going?

Mike: Going go to the bathroom.

Phoebe: Well, I think you should wait.

Mike: Why?

Phoebe: Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.

Announcer: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask.

(We see the screen where it says: "Mike will you marry me?" and then we see Phoebe and Mike on the screen. Phoebe stands up and kneels in front of Mike.)

Phoebe: Mike Hannigan... will you marry me? (Mike looks bewildered)

Announcer: Get a load of this... She's proposing to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family. (people are laughing, while Mike still seems bewildered)

Phoebe: That's not very enlightened!

(There's booing around them, and Mike sinks in his chair, holding his hand in above his eyes, hoping no-one would recognize him)

Phoebe: Hey, hey! (shouting) Boo us? Boo you!

 

[Scene: Rachel and Joey's. Joey is in the kitchen and the telephone rings.]

 

Joey: (picks up the phone) Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now... (looks puzzled) Okay, bye bye. (hangs up) (to himself) She was nice!

(Rachel and Amy enter)

Rachel: Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!

Joey: Whoo-hoo! (and leaves for Rachel's room)

Amy: You're kicking me out?

Rachel: You put holes in my baby's ears!

Amy: Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!

Rachel: (gasps) I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.

Amy: You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.

Rachel: Excuse me?

Amy: You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then, I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws (frantically pointing at her nose) And suddenly I am the bad guy?

Rachel: (yelling) Joey, where are those bags?

Joey: (Yelling from Rachel's room) She has a lot of crap!

Amy: You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great. Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without that stupid Jill... Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way...

Rachel: (doesn't believe what she's hearing) Seriously?

Amy: hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.

Rachel: Hips or thighs?

Amy: Ass and face.

Rachel: (gasps) Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.

Amy: She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking about real stuff.

Rachel: (embarrassed) Oh, I can give you that.

Amy: You can?

Rachel: Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.

Amy: (touched) Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look cute.

Rachel: Did you just say Emma?

Amy: Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella.
[Scene: Mike and Phoebe at a restaurant.]

 

Phoebe: That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.

Mike: But please, let's just forget the whole thing.

Phoebe: (the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.

(Mike's face changes from happy to sad, and he looks at the cake, disappointed.)

Phoebe: It's in the cake, isn't it?

Mike: (puts on a fake smile) Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it? (he takes the ring from the cake, and cleans it with a napkin)

Phoebe: What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

Mike: No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

(Phoebe has this weird, anxious, nervous look on her face)

Mike: I'm gonna do this now.

Phoebe: Oh my God!

(Mike starts to kneel in front of Phoebe.)

Mike: Phoebe, I...

Phoebe: Wait! Oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again, but then...) Oh no! (She was wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.)

Mike: Ready?

Phoebe: Uh-huh! (and now Mike kneels properly)

Mike: Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

Phoebe: Yes!

(Mike puts the ring on her finger)

Mike: I love you!

Phoebe: I love you more!

Mike: Not possible! (they kiss, and then Mike says proudly...) She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls.

(They kiss again, and Phoebe looks at the ring.)

COMMERCIAL BREAK

 

[Scene: The street in front of Central Perk. Rachel and Amy are walking on the sidewalk.]

 

Rachel: So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?

Amy: Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies are ugly.

Rachel: That's shocking!

Amy: Oh! It's Ross... Hey Ross! (She says hey to the guy at the falafel stand, whose only similarity with Ross would be his black hair.) Hello-oo Ross! (to Rachel) He's rude!

THE END
Rachel: You know, I'm thinking about letting Emma have her first cookie.

Joey: Her first cookie? She has cookies all the time!

Rachel: I've never given her a cookie. Have you?

Joey: No! No... and, for the record, I've also never given her a frosting from a can!

Monica: Hey Rach, the adoption agency needs letters of recommendation and we were wondering if you would write one for us.

Rachel: Of course, I'd be honored!

Chandler: Thanks!

Monica: Thank you!

(Joey looks at them, disappointed about their decision)

Joey: U-U-Um, I think there's been an oversight.

Chandler: Joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.

Monica: Yeah, it's just we don't think of you as really being so much "with the words".

Joey: Whoo-weh hey weh-hey whoo hey!!

Monica: Clearly we were wrong.

Joey: I gotta a lot of nice stuff to say about you guys, ok? And I know how much you wanna have a baby, you know, and I would love to help you get one.

Monica: You know what? Then, Joey, we want you to do it.

Joey: Thank you! Alright, let me see how I'm gonna start... "Dear baby adoption decider people..."

Chandler: So excited about your letter!

(Phoebe enters)

Phoebe: Hey!

All: Hey Phoebe!

Joey: Hey!

Monica: Wow! Don't you look nice?!

Phoebe: Yes, I do! Today is Mike and my one-year anniversary.

Rachel: OH! What's it the anniversary of? Your first date, your first kiss, first time you had sex...

Phoebe: YEAH!

Chandler: So you must be going to somewhere fancy to celebrate?

Phoebe: Uh-uh. Ehm, a Knicks game.

Joey: Uhm... Aren't you a little overdressed?

Phoebe: Hey, you know what, I've never had a one-year anniversary before, so no matter where we go, I'm wearing something fancy pants, and... I'm gonna put on my finest jewelry and we're gonna have sex in a public rest room.

Monica: You guys do that? Chandler won't even have sex in our bathroom!

Chandler: That's where people make number two!!


OPENING CREDITS
[Scene: Ross' apartment. Ross is grading papers. Charlie approaches him.]

 

Charlie: Hey! (They kiss and cuddle a little)

Ross: Hey...

Charlie: So, you know... I have a little time. If you... if you want to...

Ross: (surprised) Oh... (he pauses) (sounds disappointed) Ohh... I'd love to but I really have to grade these papers.

Charlie: Fine, it's fine... (she whispers) I'll just shower by myself...

Ross: (Writing on the papers) B, B, B, B, B!

Charlie: Oh, Ross, you gave a B to a Pottery Barn catalogue.

Ross: Well, it had some good ideas, take off your shirt.

(they start kissing but someone knocks at the door)

Ross: Damnit!

Amy: (yelling from outside) Rachel!! Open up!! It's your sister!! (she knocks on the door again) I have to talk to you!!

Ross: (he opens the door) Hi Amy!

Amy: You're not Rachel.

Ross: Still sharp as a tack!

Amy: Um... Charlie, this is Rachel's sister Amy. Amy, this is Charlie.

Charlie: Hi!

Amy: Hi!

Charlie: Nice to meet you.

Amy: H-Hi!!(to Ross) And you are...?

Ross: (pause) Ross? I... I grew up on your block! We had Thanksgiving together last year... I had a baby with your sister!

Amy: (looks confused) N-no... uhm... did I buy a falafel from you yesterday?

Ross: (gives up) Yes, yes, you did.

 

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment]

 

(Ross enters the apartment with Amy)

Ross: Hi Rachel! Here's your sister Amy! She thinks I need pec implants!

Rachel: Amy! Hi! Oh-oh-hoh! (they hug) Wow! You remember Joey?

Amy: Yeah! Hey, sure! The "Days of Our Lives" guy!

Joey: That's right, yeah.

Amy: You're not good!

Joey: Always nice to meet a fan!

Rachel: So now, what are you doing here?

Amy: Well, I have huge news.

Rachel: (Emma starts crying in the other room) Oh sorry, hold on. Let me just check on the baby!

Amy: Wait, this is important! Can Ella wait? (Rachel goes to Emma)

Ross: Ehm... Her name is Emma.

Amy: Why did you change it, Ella was so much prettier!

Ross: What do I know? I just sell Middle Eastern food from a cart!

Amy: Hey, your English is getting better!!

Ross: (to Joey) Oh my God!

Joey: I know, she may be the hottest girl I've ever hated.

Ross: What... what you working on?

Joey: (using a laptop) Oh, Monica and Chandler's recommendation. I want it to sound smart but.. I don't know any big words or anything, so...

Ross: Why don't you use your Thesaurus?

Joey: What did I just say?

Ross: Watch. (he takes the laptop) Here, you ehm... You highlight the word you want to change.
Go under Tools and the Thesaurus generates... 'gives'... 'gives' a whole list of choices. You can pick the word that sounds smartest.

Joey: Oh my God, that's great! I'm smart!! No, no, I'm... (he uses the Thesaurus) "brainy, bright, clever", I love this thing! Look out ladies, Joey Tribbiani's got the whole package!!

 

[Scene: Rachel's room. Rachel is attending to Emma. Amy is standing behind her.]

 

Rachel: God!

Amy: So beautiful.

Rachel: Oh, I know, isn't she?

Amy: No, I was talking about your bedding.

Rachel: All right. What's your news, Amy?

Amy: Oh! Um... Well... I'm getting married.

Rachel: What? Oh my God! To who?

Amy: This guy! He has a killer apartment.

Rachel: A-And??

Amy: A-And it's on Fifth. And the elevator opens up right into the living room.

Rachel: No, what's he like?

Amy: Oh! He's ok. Do you remember my old boyfriend Mark?

Rachel: Yeah.

Amy: It's his dad.

Rachel: Huh... wow, so he's gotta be...

Amy: Old? Yeah! But he travels a lot, so he's hardly ever there.

Rachel: Sweety, I gotta tell ya... it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like...

Amy: Myron. Hmm... I told you he was old!

Rachel: Oh... sit down, sit down. Oh, honey, you know, I once also almost married somebody that I didnât love. Do you remember Barry?

Amy: Humpf, remember him? How we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep.

Rachel: Sometimes just nodding is ok. (pause) Uhm, so but anyway, listen, not marrying Barry was the best decision that I ever, ever made. Honey, you deserve true love. Your soulmate is out there, somewhere. Someone that is your age, that is smart, that is fun and that you care about!

Amy: (thinks about it) Youâre right, youâre right! Iâm gonna do it!

Rachel: Ok.

Amy: Iâm gonna marry Myron and keep looking for Mr Right.

Rachel: Ok, letâs keep talking.

 

[Scene: Madison Square Garden. Mike and Phoebe are walking to their seats.]

 

Phoebe: Excuse me, anniversary. Excuse me, anniversary. (looking at her ticket). Uhm, sir, could you move your nachos... theyâre in my seat. It's my anniversary. (to Mike) Here we are! (Mike nods). Canât believe it's been a whole year!

Mike: I know. This has been the best year... (the crowd starts cheering so he starts yelling) THIS HAS BEEN THE BEST YEAR OF MY LIFE!

Phoebe: ME TOO! I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD LOVE SOMEONE THIS MUCH!

Mike: I FEEL THE SAME WAY!

Phoebe: YOUâRE SO GENEROUS AND KIND AND (crowd stops cheering) YOU'RE AMAZING IN BED (everyone hears it and stare at them.) (to everybody) ITâS OUR ANNIVERSARY!

Announcer: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the score board. Someone has a special question to ask. (on the screen thereâs written âJulie, will you marry me?â and goes on to show a guy kneeling down in front of a girl holding out a ring to her)

Phoebe: Oh how lame... oh, itâs so tacky, and impersonal.

Mike: Really?

Phoebe: Oh, itâs the worst way to propose!

Mike: (looks strangely shocked) Excuse me... (he leaves, then Phoebe realizes what she did).

 

[Scene: Monicaâs apartment. Joey enters the room]

 

Joey: Hey, finished my recommendation. (he hands it over to Chandler) Here. And I think youâll be very, very happy. Itâs the longest I ever spent on a computer without looking at porn.

Chandler: (reading) I donât... uh... understand.

Joey: (sounding very proud of himself) Some of the words are a little too sophisticated for ya?

Monica: (also reading it) It doesnât make any sense.

Joey: Of course it does! Itâs smart! I used the the-saurus!

Chandler: On every word?

Joey: Yep!

Monica: Alright, what was this sentence originally? (shows the sentence to Joey)

Joey: Oh, âThey are warm, nice, people with big heartsâ.

Chandler: And that became âthey are humid prepossessing Homo Sapiens with full sized aortic pumps...?

Joey: Yeah, yeah and hey, I really mean it, dude.

Monica: Hey Joey, I donât think we can use this.

Joey: Why not?

Monica: Well, because you signed it baby kangaroo Tribbiani (Joey makes a 'and-whatâs-wrong-with-that' look). Hey, why donât you stop worrying about sounding smart and just be yourself!

Chandler: You know what? You donât need a thesaurus, just write from here, (points at his own heart) your full sized aortic pump.

 

[Scene: The corridor. Amy knocks Joeyâs door and Rachel opens the door.]

 

Rachel: Amy, hi!

Amy: I took your advice, I left Myron.

Rachel: Oh, good for you!

Amy: I know! I'm Erin Brockovich!

Rachel: Yes you are! Oh, I am so proud of you!

Amy: Thank you! So, can I stay with you?

Rachel: But Erin Brockovich had her own house.

(Joey comes out of Monicaâs apartment and sees Rachel and Amy but does not notice the huge amount of bags)

Joey: Ah, look whoâs back! (he sees the bags) Why do you have bags? RACH, WHY DOES SHE HAVE BAGS?

Amy: Well, Iâm staying with you guys!

Joey: What?

Amy: Weâre gonna be roomies! (she snaps her finger and points at Joey, snaps her fingers again and points to the bags) Come on!

 

[Scene: Joeyâs apartment. Rachel is in the living room and Joey comes out of his room.]

 

Joey: You slept out here?

Rachel: Yeah... Amy kept kicking me in her sleep yelling âMyron, get off!â

Joey: But uhm, we're getting rid of her, right? Rach, please tell me weâre getting rid of her.

Rachel: Joey, I canât do that!

Joey: Oh, come on! Last night I was finishing off a pizza and she said (aping Amy badly) "Uoh oh oh, a moment on the lips, forever on the hips!" I donât need that kind of talk in my house!

Rachel: Well Joey, uhm look, I know that sheâs difficult, but I think itâs really good that sheâs here.

Joey: 'Cause we will appreciate it more when sheâs gone?

Rachel: No, it's just... look, you know, when I first moved to the city I was a lot like her! I was spoiled, self-centered and you guys really took care of me.

Joey: Yeah, Monica made us!

Rachel: Well, uhm... whatever, I have really appreciated it, 'cause I donât think I would be the person that I am today if it wasnât for you guys. See, I wanna help Amy the way you guys helped me. And I know itâs gonna take patience, but thatâs ok.

Amy: Good morning.

Joey: Yeaah.

Rachel: Amy, thatâs what I was supposed to wear today, thatâs why I hung it on the door.

Amy: Oh, sweety, you canât pull this off.

Rachel: Amy, you know what? I was thinking that maybe now it'd be a good time for us to sit down and, you know, talk about your future.

Amy: Oh, I canât, honey. Iâm gonna go get my eyebrows shaped. (points at her eyebrows) I am not happy. (to Joey who has a pizza box in his hands) Oh... sure you wanna eat that?

Joey: (yelling at her) IâM CURVY, AND I LIKE IT!

 

[Scene: Monicaâs Apartment. Rachel, Ross, Monica and Chandler are there, Phoebe enters the room]

 

Phoebe: Hi. I just had the worst anniversary ever.

Chandler: I doubt that! Tell her about us last year.

Monica: Oh, well, I bought Chandler a five hundred dollar watch and he wrote me a rap song.

Ross: Seriously?

Chandler: Word!

Phoebe: Well, mine was worse than that.

Rachel: Well, what happened?

Phoebe: We were at the game, and this guy proposed to his girlfriend on the big screen thing...

Rachel: Oh, that is so tacky.

Phoebe: Well, thatâs what I said, but it turns out, Mike was planning on proposing to me that same way last night!

Monica: Oh my God, Mike was gonna propose?

Rachel: Phoebe, thatâs huge!

Ross: Well, do you wanna marry him?

Phoebe: Yeah, I really do! Yes, but, after I dumped on the way he was gonna propose to me, I donât think heâs ever gonna ask again! I mean, I said no in Barbados and now this!

Chandler: She's right! If I were a guy and... (stops himself mid-sentence...everyone stares at him) Did I just say if I were a guy..?

Monica: Maybe you don't need him to propose to you, maybe you can propose to him!

Phoebe: Oh, I don't know, I don't know, isn't that a little desperate?

Monica: I proposed to Chandler! (Phoebe stops herself from laughing) Alright, moving on...

Chandler: Oh, I don't think it was desperate, I think it was amazing!

Monica: Thank you.

Phoebe: (To Rachel and Ross) Well, do you think I should propose?

Rachel: I think it could be kind of great!

Ross: Absolutely! You'll love the feeling! There's nothing like it!

Phoebe: Ok, ok, so how should I do it?

Monica: How about at a game, on the big screen?

Rachel: (Sarcastically) Uuuh!! How about at a Footlocker? (claps her hands together, faking excitement)

Monica: What? what? He obviously thinks that's a nice way to be proposed to, plus he'd never suspect it!

Phoebe: Yeah, that does make sense. Ok, now, would... would you two (points to Ross and Chandler) like that?

Chandler: Sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?

(Amy walks in carrying a phone handset)

Amy: (To Rachel) Nana is on the phone (Hands the phone over to Rachel)

Rachel: (Takes the phone) Oh! That's interesting, since she died seven years ago!!

Amy: She did? Who got her condo in Boca?

Rachel: (Into the phone) Hello? (announces to Amy) Oh, it's our nanny! (goes back to the phone conversation) Hi! Oh... God! I hope you feel better! Ok, bye! (Hangs up) (To Ross) That's Molly, she's sick. Can you watch Emma today?

Ross: No, I can't. I have back-to-back classes. Did Molly say what she had? Because my throat's been hurting?

Rachel: Menstrual cramps.

Ross: I don't think that's what this is.

Rachel: (To Monica, Chandler and Phoebe) Can any of you watch Emma?

Monica: No, sorry sweety..

Phoebe: No, I've got work and then I'm proposing..

Rachel: (To Ross) Great, shoot, what are we gonna do?

Amy: Well, I can do it.

Rachel: (Thinks for a moment) Well, actually...

Ross: (He interrupts her immediately, and drags her by her arm to the other side of the room) Well, can I talk to you for a sec.?

Rachel: Yeah.

Ross: Um, I do not want her baby-sitting our child.

Rachel: Why not?

Ross: Well, for one thing, she keeps calling her Ella!

Rachel: (Defends Amy) Wha.. well, Ella's a nice name!

Ross: Fine, we'll call the next one Ella.

Rachel: (Shocked) Wha... the next one?

Ross: (a little confused) Okay, um... I don't want her watching our baby.

Rachel: Ross, I am trying to help her become a better person. This is a huge breakthrough for her! She just offered to do something for another human being!!

Ross: I... I don't know..

Rachel: Ross, I'm telling you, she's giving up getting her eyebrows (points at her own to emphasize the word) shaped to do this alright? Do you understand how important that is in our world?

(Amy approaches from behind)

Amy: um... listen, I couldn't help but overhear... 'cause I was trying to... Listen, let me do this alright? I really wanna help you guys out, and plus Rachel's been so wonderful to me... (looks at hem pleadingly)

(Rachel looks at Ross and her agrees silently)

Rachel: Absolutely.

Amy: (very excited) Oh! Great! So how much does it pay? (Ross just gives up and leaves)

 

[Scene: Central Perk. Joey is inside, Chandler and Monica walk in.]

 

Chandler: Hey Joe! How's the second draft of the letter coming?

Joey: Great, I'm finished! In fact, I just dropped it off at the agency.

(Chandler and Monica look shocked)

Monica: You dropped it off?

Joey: Yeah.

Chandler: Can we read it? Can you print out another copy?

Joey: No can do amigo. No, I didn't use the computer. Felt more personal to hand-write it. (Chandler and Monica look even more shocked)

Monica: You hand-wrote it?

Joey: Yeah, and don't worry. I didn't try to sound smart at all! See ya later! (Leaves)

Monica: Oh my God, oh my God, that letter is gonna go in our file! We're never gonna get a kid. No, we're gonna be one of those old couples that collects orchids or has a lot of birds!

Chandler: It's ok, it's ok. You know what? (Takes out his mobile) I'll just call the agency and tell them to throw out the letter. (starts dialing)

Monica: Okay good.

Chandler: (on the phone) Hello, this is Chandler Bing. Somebody just dropped off a handwritten recommendation letter, and.. (listens) Uh-huh... Uh-huh... okay... thank you. Good-bye. (hangs up looking very confused).

Monica: Ugh, we're screwed, aren't we? You know what? Just tell me on the way to the bird store.

Chandler: (Still looks confused) They loved it.

Monica: What?

Chandler: They thought it was very smart of us to have a child write the recommendation letter.

Monica: (surprised) They thought Joey was a child?

Chandler: She guessed 8, 9, based on his drawings.

(Amy comes in with Emma in a stroller)

Amy: Hi!

Monica: Hey, what did you guys do today?

Amy: Ella wanted to go out, so we went shopping and got some sushi.

Chandler: That sounds like fun.

Amy: Yeah, not really. Babies are dull.

(Rachel comes in, sees Amy and Emma)

Rachel: (To Emma) Hey! Hi, how's my girl?

Amy: I'm fine! And, I got you a present for letting me stay with you. Ready?

Rachel: (sounds excited) Yeah!

(Amy takes off Emma's hat)

Amy: Ta-daaa!

(Rachel looks at Emma)

Rachel: (not excited anymore) You pierced her ears!?

Amy: (Very excited about it) Doesn't it make her nose look smaller?

(Rachel looks very shocked)

COMMERCIAL BREAK


Rachel: You pierced her ears? How could you do this without telling me?

Amy: Well, if I had told you, then it wouldn't have been surprise, now would it?

Chandler: I think she looks cute. (Rachel turns around and stares at him angrily) ... but I am wrong!

Rachel: Oh my God, Oh my God, here comes Ross. He's gonna flip out.

Amy: Why, did something happen to his falafel cart?

Rachel: Ugh. (takes the hat and covers Emma's head and half her face with it)

(Ross enters)

Ross: Hey guys.

Monica and Chandler: Hi Ross.

Ross: Hey Emma. Oh, why is she wearing her hat so low? She can barely see. (Wants to take the hat off, but Rachel tries to stop him).

Rachel: Nah, I don't really want her to see.

Ross: Why not?

Monica: Because there are so many terrible sights in this world.

Chandler: Like war. Or that thing in Joey's refrigerator. Remember? It was in a milk carton but it looked like meat?

Ross: Come here (Removes Emma's hat) Oh! There she is! Hi!

(Rachel looks worried)

Ross: (sees how strangely Monica, Chandler and Rachel are looking at him) What?

Rachel: Nothing.

Ross: (Back to Emma) Hi! (Looks at her) What... (Moves the stroller away from him so he can get a better look at her. He looks at her confused. Finally he realizes the difference and gasps). Please tell me those are clip-ons.

Rachel: Oh, they're real!

Ross: Did she (points at Amy) do this to her? I told you we shouldn't have left Emma with her!

Rachel: I know, I know, and you were right Ross. (To Amy) You are soo irresponsible I am never letting you baby-sit ever again!

Amy: Hey you know what, this kid needs me, okay? She needs to have a cool fun aunt!

Monica: I'm a cool, fun aunt!

Amy: (Sarcastically) O-Okay!

Chandler: Hey! Monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!

Rachel: I can't believe this. All I wanted to do was help you try to figure out what to do with your life and this is how you repay me?

Amy: Well, I don't need you to help me, because I already know what I'm going to do with my life.

Rachel: Oh yeah? Since when?

Amy: Since today... I am going to be a baby stylist.

Rachel: (looks at Ross and then at Amy again in disbelief) What?

Ross: That's not a thing!

Amy: Well, it should be. I'm gonna help babies learn how to accessorize, what colors to wear, what clothes are slimming...

Rachel: (shouting) Babies don't care if they're slim.

Amy: Enter Amy!

Ross: (very angry) Amy, I ju... I just... I just wanna...

Amy: What? What are you gonna do?

Ross: (pointing at Amy, shouting) No more falafel for you!

(Amy looks at Ross, angrily. Rachel clearly doesn't understand what he meant and looks at Ross who gestures "later".)

 

[Scene: Madison Square Garden. Phoebe and Mike are watching the game. There's cheering, but Phoebe seems distracted.]

 

Mike: Great game, huh?

Phoebe: Uhuh, uhuh... (seems distracted)

Mike: Why do you keep looking at the screen?

Phoebe: I'm not. I'm praying. (looking up) Please let the Knicks win... Thank you Thor! (Mike is standing up) Where... where are you going?

Mike: Going go to the bathroom.

Phoebe: Well, I think you should wait.

Mike: Why?

Phoebe: Well, if you don't... if you don't hold it in, you don't get all the nutrients.

Announcer: Knicks fans, please turn your attention to the big screen on the scoreboard. Someone has a special question to ask.

(We see the screen where it says: "Mike will you marry me?" and then we see Phoebe and Mike on the screen. Phoebe stands up and kneels in front of Mike.)

Phoebe: Mike Hannigan... will you marry me? (Mike looks bewildered)

Announcer: Get a load of this... She's proposing to him. Guess we know who wears the pants in that family. (people are laughing, while Mike still seems bewildered)

Phoebe: That's not very enlightened!

(There's booing around them, and Mike sinks in his chair, holding his hand in above his eyes, hoping no-one would recognize him)

Phoebe: Hey, hey! (shouting) Boo us? Boo you!

 

[Scene: Rachel and Joey's. Joey is in the kitchen and the telephone rings.]

 

Joey: (picks up the phone) Hello? Yeah, this is Joey Tribbiani... Oh, hi! Well, I'm glad you liked my letter... No my mommy and daddy aren't home right now... (looks puzzled) Okay, bye bye. (hangs up) (to himself) She was nice!

(Rachel and Amy enter)

Rachel: Joey, get Amy's bags, she is moving out!

Joey: Whoo-hoo! (and leaves for Rachel's room)

Amy: You're kicking me out?

Rachel: You put holes in my baby's ears!

Amy: Yeah well, at least now people will know she is a girl!

Rachel: (gasps) I can't believe I ever even tried to help you. You are so beyond help.

Amy: You know what? Ever since I got here, you have been nothing but negative.

Rachel: Excuse me?

Amy: You didn't want me to marry the old guy with the great apartment. Then, I tried to help your daughter to de-emphasize her flaws (frantically pointing at her nose) And suddenly I am the bad guy?

Rachel: (yelling) Joey, where are those bags?

Joey: (Yelling from Rachel's room) She has a lot of crap!

Amy: You know what? When I moved in here I thought: This is gonna be so great. Just us sisters, back together again like when we were kids, except without that stupid Jill... Oh! Who has gotten fat by the way...

Rachel: (doesn't believe what she's hearing) Seriously?

Amy: hm-mmm... Mom said she gained like fifteen pounds.

Rachel: Hips or thighs?

Amy: Ass and face.

Rachel: (gasps) Oh! Oh my God! I thought she was on Atkins.

Amy: She was. Carbs found her... See, this is what I wanted. Two sisters, talking about real stuff.

Rachel: (embarrassed) Oh, I can give you that.

Amy: You can?

Rachel: Yeah. I just, I kept trying to make you a better person, but you're... you're already a pretty perfect version of what you are.

Amy: (touched) Thank you. I've got to admit, Emma does look cute.

Rachel: Did you just say Emma?

Amy: Ugh, I'm sorry... Ella.
[Scene: Mike and Phoebe at a restaurant.]

 

Phoebe: That woman at the game didn't know what she was talking about. Mike, obviously you have balls.

Mike: But please, let's just forget the whole thing.

Phoebe: (the waiter puts a piece of cake on the table) I would love it. Consider it forgotten... But just so you know... however and whenever you decide to propose, I promise I'll say yes. Whether... whether, you know, it is in a basketball game, or in sky writing, or you know, like some lame guy in a cheesy movie who hides it in the cake.

(Mike's face changes from happy to sad, and he looks at the cake, disappointed.)

Phoebe: It's in the cake, isn't it?

Mike: (puts on a fake smile) Where else would lame Mr. No Balls hide it? (he takes the ring from the cake, and cleans it with a napkin)

Phoebe: What's the matter with me? How do I keep ruining this? I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

Mike: No! It's my fault. I keep trying to propose in these stupid ways and all I wanna do is tell you that I love you and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

(Phoebe has this weird, anxious, nervous look on her face)

Mike: I'm gonna do this now.

Phoebe: Oh my God!

(Mike starts to kneel in front of Phoebe.)

Mike: Phoebe, I...

Phoebe: Wait! Oh wait! (she takes off a ring that was already on her left ring finger. After that Mike starts to kneel again, but then...) Oh no! (She was wearing rings on all her fingers and her thumb, and takes all of these off.)

Mike: Ready?

Phoebe: Uh-huh! (and now Mike kneels properly)

Mike: Phoebe, I love you. There's no-one else in the world I would ask to marry me... three times. But I wanna take care of you, have babies with you, and grow old with you... Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

Phoebe: Yes!

(Mike puts the ring on her finger)

Mike: I love you!

Phoebe: I love you more!

Mike: Not possible! (they kiss, and then Mike says proudly...) She's gonna be Mrs. No Balls.

(They kiss again, and Phoebe looks at the ring.)

COMMERCIAL BREAK

 

[Scene: The street in front of Central Perk. Rachel and Amy are walking on the sidewalk.]

 

Rachel: So how is the uhm... baby styling business going?

Amy: Not that great. It's almost if people don't want to hear that their babies are ugly.

Rachel: That's shocking!

Amy: Oh! It's Ross... Hey Ross! (She says hey to the guy at the falafel stand, whose only similarity with Ross would be his black hair.) Hello-oo Ross! (to Rachel) He's rude!

THE END
Phoebe: (she enters) Hey...

All: Hey!

Rachel: Hi!

Ross: Pheebs, what's wrong?

Phoebe: Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this... (she shows her ring) HUGE engagement ring!

All: OH!

Rachel: My God!

Joey: Hey!

Rachel: Congratulations! Wow!!

Ross: So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or (in a tender way) did he cry? (the guys look at him) Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals!

Phoebe: Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.

Joey: Well, hey! Well... (he takes his mug to toast Phoebe) Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and... (a bit uncertain) I wanna say Mike? (pause) To Phoebe and Mike!

All: Whoo!

Phoebe: Thank you! (to Rachel) Oh, and I have something for you!

Rachel: Mmh-mmh!

Phoebe: It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated.

Rachel: Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what, I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?

Phoebe: I would, but you're the last one.

Rachel: (angrily) GIVE ME THE BOOK! (she takes it and start reading) Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"?

Phoebe: Oh, my first love!

Rachel: Oh!

Monica: What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?

Phoebe: Dead. (everyone is a bit upset) Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.

Chandler: Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.

Rachel: Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?

Phoebe: (proud of herself) Oh yes, they are.


OPENING CREDITS
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]

 

Chandler: (he enters) Hey honey!

Joey: (Looking inside the fridge, and we only see his back. Then he closes the door, and we see it's Joey.) Hi sweetie!

Chandler: Is Monica not here?

Joey: No.

Chandler: Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!

Joey: Cool!

Chandler: Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! (silence) Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!

Joey: That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?

Chandler: Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.

Joey: What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh? (he mimes an old man with a beard) I'm old! (then he yawns) I'm tired! (then he mimes someone who's hot...) Hey, I'm hot (...and cold) I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?

Chandler: First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.

Joey: I can do that! (in a deeper voice) "Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?

Chandler: Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?

Joey: (after a long pause he starts miming again) I'm cold!
 

[Scene: Central Perk. Charlie is sitting on the couch and Ross enters.]

 

Ross: (to Charlie) Hey!

Charlie: Hey!

Ross: Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.

Charlie: Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations!

Ross: Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!

Charlie: Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!

Ross: Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!

Charlie: Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?

Ross: Yeah. Why?

Charlie: Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.

Ross: Your ex-boyfriend?

Charlie: Yeah.

Ross: So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!

Charlie: No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can introduce you.

Ross: Well, if you think it would help.

Charlie: Yes, absolutely. I'll call him.

Ross: Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?

Charlie: Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.

Ross: We'll see how dinner goes.

 

[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. She is packing a few tings into boxes.]

Phoebe: (looking at Monica entering) Hey!

Monica: Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?

Phoebe: Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in.

Monica: Oh, right.

Phoebe: Yeah.

Monica: Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!

Phoebe: Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?

Monica: Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?

Phoebe: A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.

Monica: Who's Gladys? (Phoebe shows her a horrific painting with a half-a-body girl dummy coming out of the frame. Monica's frightened and she gasps.) Oh! What a tragic loss!

Phoebe: Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!

Monica: (faking happiness) Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...

Phoebe: Why, you don't like her?

Monica: Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!

Phoebe: Really? You think?

Monica: Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"

Phoebe: Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.

Monica: Damn it, I did not think this through!
[Scene: Central Perk. Rachel, Joey and Emma are there.]

 

Chandler: Hey you guys.

Rachel: Hi!

Joey: Oh! Any word on casting yet?

Chandler: Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.

Joey: What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?

Rachel: I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.

Joey (to Chandler): Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor! (he glances at his watch and sees the time) Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! (he stands, ready to go). Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in.

Chandler: Joe...

Joey: Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!

Chandler: Fine!

Joey: Thank you. (he sits down)

Chandler: Work, Joe!

Joey: Damn it! (he leaves)

Chandler (to Rachel): What am I gonna do now?

Joey: Just pass it to your boss!

Chandler: He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!

Rachel: Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.

Chandler: That's good! I liked it, they didn't. (he sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey, for God's sake, go to work! (Joey runs away).
[Scene: A restaurant. Ross and Charlie are waiting for her ex-boyfriend, Benjamin Hobart]

 


Ross: I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?

Charlie: (glances over Ross' shoulder) Sorry, looks like it's just him.

Benjamin: Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!

Ross: Well, I... I am having a good hair day.

Benjamin: So good to see you.

Charlie: Me too. (she and Benjamin are hugging for very long and Ross starts pretending to clear his throat, until they stop)

Ross: I'm ok.

Charlie: I'm sorry... (introduces them to each other) Ross Geller... Benjamin Hobart.

Ross: It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize, (he thumbs up) whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.

Benjamin: Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!

Charlie: Shall we? (they sit down and Benjamin takes Ross' chair).

Benjamin: (to Ross) Thank you! (to Charlie). I can't believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night?

Charlie: Oh my God, I completely forgot! (they laugh) Oh my God! I can't believe they let us back in this place! (they laugh more, and Ross start laughing too).

Benjamin (to Ross): You weren't there!

Ross: No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... (laughs nervously)tzz-zzz, mmm.

Charlie: Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal, while I go to the ladies room?

Benjamin: So, tell me about it.

Ross: Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.

Benjamin: M-m.

Ross: See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.

Benjamin: Break up with Charlie!

Ross: What?

Benjamin: What?

Ross: Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?

Benjamin: Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it.

Ross: Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?

Benjamin: I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her.

Ross: Are you serious?

Benjamin: If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then I'm joking!

Ross: No!

Benjamin: Joking it is!
[Scene: Monica's apartment. Phoebe enters the room.]

 

Phoebe: Hi! Sorry, I'm late.

Monica: Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?

Phoebe: No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!

Monica: Wow, what's the bad news!

Rachel: Who's Gladys?

Phoebe: Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.

Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!

Phoebe: Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!

Monica: Huh!

Rachel: Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...

Monica: You know, I would give her up, for you.

Rachel: No, I couldn't let you do that.

Monica: But I want to.

Rachel: But I don't want you to.

Monica: But I insist!

Rachel: But I insist harder!

Phoebe: Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. (she flips the coin). Tails! Monica, she's yours!

Monica: No, that landed in your food!

Rachel: (sarcastic) No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!
[Scene: Chandler walks into Joey's apartment]

 

Chandler: Hey Joe!

Joey: What's up?

Chandler: Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.

Joey: (sounds disappointed) Oh.

Chandler: (Hands the tape back to him) I'm sorry man.

Joey: (looks at him suspiciously) But, ehm... you watched the tape?

Chandler: (sounds nervous) Yeah! I... I... I liked it! (Joey continues to look at him suspiciously) But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!

Joey: (sounds confident) You didn't watch the tape.

Chandler: (looks surprised) What!? Of course I did!

Joey: Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?

Chandler: I'm not lying to you, I watched it!

Joey: Well, you lied again! (Rachel comes out of her room and is observing the conversation)

Chandler: I watched it!

Joey: Keep going Pinocchio!

Chandler: (now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) I did!

Joey: (yelling back) No you didn't! (turns and goes towards his room)

Chandler: (following him) I'm telling you, I watched the tape. (Reaches Joey's room and Joey slams the door in his face)

Rachel: Did you watch the tape?

Chandler:(In a sarcastic "of course not"!-tone) No!
[Scene: Interview room. Ross and two other professors (one man, one woman) are sitting on one side of a long desk. Benjamin Hobart is sitting on the other side]

 

Benjamin: The selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you propose to correct this problem?

Dr. Li: Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence. I plan to begin there.

Benjamin: (nods) Interesting.

Ross: (Rolls his eyes) I guess!

Benjamin: Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work. Where might that take place?

Dr. Biely: Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.

Benjamin: Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?

Ross: (shocked and confused by the question) What? I... I... (Benjamin looks at him as if to say "What's wrong? Answer the question")

Benjamin: Care to venture a guess?

Ross: (annoyed) May 12th?

Benjamin: (looks surprised and un-impressed) That's not even kinda close! (Ross looks around confused) Dr. Li, how many graduate students you'd be needing?

Dr. Li: Half a dozen.

Benjamin: I see, and Dr. Biely?

Dr. Biely: Three for excavation and two for analysis.

Benjamin: Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band?

Ross: (even more shocked) Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.

Benjamin: No! I'm sorry, we were looking for "Baby It's You". Baby It's You.

Ross: Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.

Benjamin: You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell "Boscodictiasaur".

Ross: (annoyed) um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur".

Benjamin: Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.

Ross: (stares at him angrily) Ok. (determined to spell it correctly) B - O - S ...

Benjamin: No, it starts with a silent "M".

Ross: Oh come on!!
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Chandler and Rachel are talking.]

 

Chandler: I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!

Rachel: But you are a liar.

Chandler: What did I just say?

(Joey comes out of his room)

Joey: You still here?

Chandler: Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...

Joey: Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... (loses count and begins to count the number of 'lyings' in the air but gives up.) (yelling) Stop lying!

Chandler: Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?

Joey: (very angry) You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why? (goes back into his room)

Rachel: Well, this is going well. (Chandler looks worried)

Joey: (comes out holding the tape) Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? (puts it into the vcr) If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan. (presses play and he appears on the TV screen and a TV commercial begins)

(The commercial:

Joey says "Ichiban". It displays a few girls dancing around and Joey fills most of the screen, he puts something blue on his lips and smacks them saying "Lipstick For Men!" It goes on to show him playing a guitar and putting on more blue lipstick. In the end he says seductively "Ichiban... Lipstick For Men" and "Sahiko" and it ends. Chandler and Rachel are speechless.)


Joey: (Yelling at Chandler) And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! (goes back to his room and slams the door).

(Silence)

Chandler: He really is a chameleon.
[Scene: Monica's apartment. Phoebe enters carrying the horrific 'painting' of Gladys. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]

 

Phoebe: (smiling from ear to ear) Well, Gladys say hello to your new home! (she holds out the 'painting')

Monica: (faking happiness) Oh, my!

Rachel: (surprised by how ugly it is) Wow! (sarcastic) Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly? (looks around for a spot)


Monica: (sounds desperate, knowing what Rachel is trying to do) I haven't really settled on a spot yet!

Rachel: Well, hey! How about right above the TV? (Points to the spot where her famous French poster is hanging). That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!

Phoebe: (genuinely excited about it) Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.

Monica: (offended) I like that poster!

Phoebe: Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?

Rachel: (jumps at the chance to make that happen) Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!

Monica: (Impatient with Rachel) Are you still here?

[Scene: Ross' office. Ross is pacing and Benjamin enters]



Ross: Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? (Now yelling) Aunt Margaret's pants size?

Benjamin: I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.

Ross: (Sarcastic) No! Stop!

Benjamin: Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.

Ross: (Skeptical) Really?

Benjamin: Well... there is just one small... stipulation...

Ross: I have to break up with Charlie?

Benjamin: Hey, you got one right!

(Ross shakes his head)

Ross: You're crazy.

Benjamin: Crazy, or... romantic?

Ross: Crazy!

Benjamin: Ooor...

Ross: (Yelling) Get out! (Benjamin leaves)
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.]

(Rachel enters, checking the mail, then looks up and sees Gladys placed on the barcalounger.)

Rachel: O-oh my God!

Joey: (enters from his bedroom) What?

Rachel: Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?

Joey: I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.

Rachel: Joey, we're not keeping this!

Joey: But it's an original Buffay...

Rachel: Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.

Joey: Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?

Rachel: Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.

(Joey's eyes are twice their size now, and looks nervously from Rachel to Gladys and back.)

Rachel: She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. (in a spooky, slow voice) And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.

Joey: GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!

(Joey leaves for his bedroom, and Rachel grins. She then takes Gladys and enters Monica's apartment.)

Monica: Hey! I sold that to Joey.

Rachel: Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game. (gives Gladys to Monica)

Monica: No, too late. You can't give it back! (she pushes the painting back to Rachel)

Rachel: Yes I can! (pushes her back again)

Monica: No you can't. She's yours!

Rachel: She's yours!

Monica: SHE'S YOURS!

Rachel: She's yours!

(While they are both pushing the painting towards each other, Phoebe enters)

Phoebe: Hey! (there's a pause)

Rachel: She's mine!

Monica: She's m-i-i-ne!

Rachel: She's mine!

Monica: She's mine!

Phoebe: You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous painting/collage. One of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress and orange gloves reaching out into the room. Around the head 3 small dolls are hovering.) Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis. (Rachel and Monica are gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.)

Rachel: I want Gladys!

Monica: She's mine!

Rachel: She's mine!

Monica: She's mine!

Rachel: She's mine!

[Scene: Rachel and Joey's. Joey's home alone, reading a Sports Illustrated magazine when Chandler enters.]

Chandler: Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.

Joey: That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.

Chandler: I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
[Scene: Central Perk. Monica, Phoebe and Rachel are on the couch.]

Monica: Oh my God!

(we see Joey and Chandler standing there, and Chandler is wearing the blue Ichiban lipstick!)

Rachel: Excellent!

Joey: Now, what do you say?

Chandler: Lying is wrong!

Joey: And?... AND?

Chandler: I'm a pretty little girl.

Phoebe: I knew it!
[Scene: Central Perk. Some time later that day. The group has left and Charlie is there when Ross enters.]

Ross: Your ex-boyfriend is insane.

Charlie: Did you get the grant?

Ross: No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.

Charlie: What?

Ross: Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.

Charlie: Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man.

Ross: Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of "Underdog"?

Charlie: I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.

Ross: If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.

Charlie: Seriously?

Ross: Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?

Charlie: Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O...

Ross: Damnit!
[Scene: Benjamin's office. Ross and Charlie are entering.]

Benjamin: Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here?

Ross: I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!

Benjamin: Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.

Ross: No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.

Charlie: Benji?

Benjamin: Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life.

Ross: Too little, too late, Benji!

Charlie: I can't believe this.

Benjamin: I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?

Ross: (indignant) No!

Charlie: Yes!

Ross: What?

Charlie: I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... romantic.

Ross: or...

Benjamin: Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back?

Charlie: Maybe...

Ross: Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.

Charlie: Oh God! I am so sorry, but... (she puts her hand on Ross's cheek) I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know...

Benjamin: (puts his hand on Ross's other cheek) I'm sorry too...

(Charlie and Benji both let their hands slide down Ross's face, until their hands meet, and they hold hands.)

Benjamin: I love you!

Charlie: I love you too! (and they start to kiss)

Ross: Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!


COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: Joey's bedroom. Joey's asleep with Hugsy, the penguin right next to him.]

(There are scratching and squeaking noises coming from the living room, and Joey wakes up, terrified. He pulls his blanket higher. The doorknob is turning.)

Joey: Gladys?

(The door opens, and there is Gladys, still in her frame though. Joey panics and moves frantically, screaming. Then there is laughing, and the painting is lowered. It was Rachel holding Gladys.)

Rachel: Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old.

Joey: You're mean!

Rachel: Oh, don't be such a baby!

(She closes his door again, and turns around. Then she starts screaming, terrified. There is Glynnis... And Monica holding her up, laughing.)


end
 
Phoebe: (she enters) Hey...

All: Hey!

Rachel: Hi!

Ross: Pheebs, what's wrong?

Phoebe: Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this... (she shows her ring) HUGE engagement ring!

All: OH!

Rachel: My God!

Joey: Hey!

Rachel: Congratulations! Wow!!

Ross: So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or (in a tender way) did he cry? (the guys look at him) Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals!

Phoebe: Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.

Joey: Well, hey! Well... (he takes his mug to toast Phoebe) Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and... (a bit uncertain) I wanna say Mike? (pause) To Phoebe and Mike!

All: Whoo!

Phoebe: Thank you! (to Rachel) Oh, and I have something for you!

Rachel: Mmh-mmh!

Phoebe: It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated.

Rachel: Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what, I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?

Phoebe: I would, but you're the last one.

Rachel: (angrily) GIVE ME THE BOOK! (she takes it and start reading) Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"?

Phoebe: Oh, my first love!

Rachel: Oh!

Monica: What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?

Phoebe: Dead. (everyone is a bit upset) Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.

Chandler: Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.

Rachel: Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?

Phoebe: (proud of herself) Oh yes, they are.


OPENING CREDITS
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]

 

Chandler: (he enters) Hey honey!

Joey: (Looking inside the fridge, and we only see his back. Then he closes the door, and we see it's Joey.) Hi sweetie!

Chandler: Is Monica not here?

Joey: No.

Chandler: Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!

Joey: Cool!

Chandler: Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! (silence) Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!

Joey: That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?

Chandler: Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.

Joey: What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh? (he mimes an old man with a beard) I'm old! (then he yawns) I'm tired! (then he mimes someone who's hot...) Hey, I'm hot (...and cold) I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?

Chandler: First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.

Joey: I can do that! (in a deeper voice) "Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?

Chandler: Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?

Joey: (after a long pause he starts miming again) I'm cold!
 

[Scene: Central Perk. Charlie is sitting on the couch and Ross enters.]

 

Ross: (to Charlie) Hey!

Charlie: Hey!

Ross: Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.

Charlie: Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations!

Ross: Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!

Charlie: Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!

Ross: Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!

Charlie: Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?

Ross: Yeah. Why?

Charlie: Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.

Ross: Your ex-boyfriend?

Charlie: Yeah.

Ross: So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!

Charlie: No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can introduce you.

Ross: Well, if you think it would help.

Charlie: Yes, absolutely. I'll call him.

Ross: Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?

Charlie: Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.

Ross: We'll see how dinner goes.

 

[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. She is packing a few tings into boxes.]

Phoebe: (looking at Monica entering) Hey!

Monica: Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?

Phoebe: Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in.

Monica: Oh, right.

Phoebe: Yeah.

Monica: Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!

Phoebe: Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?

Monica: Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?

Phoebe: A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.

Monica: Who's Gladys? (Phoebe shows her a horrific painting with a half-a-body girl dummy coming out of the frame. Monica's frightened and she gasps.) Oh! What a tragic loss!

Phoebe: Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!

Monica: (faking happiness) Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...

Phoebe: Why, you don't like her?

Monica: Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!

Phoebe: Really? You think?

Monica: Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"

Phoebe: Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.

Monica: Damn it, I did not think this through!
[Scene: Central Perk. Rachel, Joey and Emma are there.]

 

Chandler: Hey you guys.

Rachel: Hi!

Joey: Oh! Any word on casting yet?

Chandler: Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.

Joey: What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?

Rachel: I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.

Joey (to Chandler): Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor! (he glances at his watch and sees the time) Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! (he stands, ready to go). Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in.

Chandler: Joe...

Joey: Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!

Chandler: Fine!

Joey: Thank you. (he sits down)

Chandler: Work, Joe!

Joey: Damn it! (he leaves)

Chandler (to Rachel): What am I gonna do now?

Joey: Just pass it to your boss!

Chandler: He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!

Rachel: Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.

Chandler: That's good! I liked it, they didn't. (he sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey, for God's sake, go to work! (Joey runs away).
[Scene: A restaurant. Ross and Charlie are waiting for her ex-boyfriend, Benjamin Hobart]

 


Ross: I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?

Charlie: (glances over Ross' shoulder) Sorry, looks like it's just him.

Benjamin: Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!

Ross: Well, I... I am having a good hair day.

Benjamin: So good to see you.

Charlie: Me too. (she and Benjamin are hugging for very long and Ross starts pretending to clear his throat, until they stop)

Ross: I'm ok.

Charlie: I'm sorry... (introduces them to each other) Ross Geller... Benjamin Hobart.

Ross: It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize, (he thumbs up) whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.

Benjamin: Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!

Charlie: Shall we? (they sit down and Benjamin takes Ross' chair).

Benjamin: (to Ross) Thank you! (to Charlie). I can't believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night?

Charlie: Oh my God, I completely forgot! (they laugh) Oh my God! I can't believe they let us back in this place! (they laugh more, and Ross start laughing too).

Benjamin (to Ross): You weren't there!

Ross: No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... (laughs nervously)tzz-zzz, mmm.

Charlie: Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal, while I go to the ladies room?

Benjamin: So, tell me about it.

Ross: Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.

Benjamin: M-m.

Ross: See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.

Benjamin: Break up with Charlie!

Ross: What?

Benjamin: What?

Ross: Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?

Benjamin: Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it.

Ross: Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?

Benjamin: I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her.

Ross: Are you serious?

Benjamin: If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then I'm joking!

Ross: No!

Benjamin: Joking it is!
[Scene: Monica's apartment. Phoebe enters the room.]

 

Phoebe: Hi! Sorry, I'm late.

Monica: Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?

Phoebe: No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!

Monica: Wow, what's the bad news!

Rachel: Who's Gladys?

Phoebe: Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.

Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!

Phoebe: Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!

Monica: Huh!

Rachel: Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...

Monica: You know, I would give her up, for you.

Rachel: No, I couldn't let you do that.

Monica: But I want to.

Rachel: But I don't want you to.

Monica: But I insist!

Rachel: But I insist harder!

Phoebe: Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. (she flips the coin). Tails! Monica, she's yours!

Monica: No, that landed in your food!

Rachel: (sarcastic) No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!
[Scene: Chandler walks into Joey's apartment]

 

Chandler: Hey Joe!

Joey: What's up?

Chandler: Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.

Joey: (sounds disappointed) Oh.

Chandler: (Hands the tape back to him) I'm sorry man.

Joey: (looks at him suspiciously) But, ehm... you watched the tape?

Chandler: (sounds nervous) Yeah! I... I... I liked it! (Joey continues to look at him suspiciously) But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!

Joey: (sounds confident) You didn't watch the tape.

Chandler: (looks surprised) What!? Of course I did!

Joey: Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?

Chandler: I'm not lying to you, I watched it!

Joey: Well, you lied again! (Rachel comes out of her room and is observing the conversation)

Chandler: I watched it!

Joey: Keep going Pinocchio!

Chandler: (now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) I did!

Joey: (yelling back) No you didn't! (turns and goes towards his room)

Chandler: (following him) I'm telling you, I watched the tape. (Reaches Joey's room and Joey slams the door in his face)

Rachel: Did you watch the tape?

Chandler:(In a sarcastic "of course not"!-tone) No!
[Scene: Interview room. Ross and two other professors (one man, one woman) are sitting on one side of a long desk. Benjamin Hobart is sitting on the other side]

 

Benjamin: The selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you propose to correct this problem?

Dr. Li: Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence. I plan to begin there.

Benjamin: (nods) Interesting.

Ross: (Rolls his eyes) I guess!

Benjamin: Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work. Where might that take place?

Dr. Biely: Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.

Benjamin: Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?

Ross: (shocked and confused by the question) What? I... I... (Benjamin looks at him as if to say "What's wrong? Answer the question")

Benjamin: Care to venture a guess?

Ross: (annoyed) May 12th?

Benjamin: (looks surprised and un-impressed) That's not even kinda close! (Ross looks around confused) Dr. Li, how many graduate students you'd be needing?

Dr. Li: Half a dozen.

Benjamin: I see, and Dr. Biely?

Dr. Biely: Three for excavation and two for analysis.

Benjamin: Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band?

Ross: (even more shocked) Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.

Benjamin: No! I'm sorry, we were looking for "Baby It's You". Baby It's You.

Ross: Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.

Benjamin: You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell "Boscodictiasaur".

Ross: (annoyed) um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur".

Benjamin: Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.

Ross: (stares at him angrily) Ok. (determined to spell it correctly) B - O - S ...

Benjamin: No, it starts with a silent "M".

Ross: Oh come on!!
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Chandler and Rachel are talking.]

 

Chandler: I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!

Rachel: But you are a liar.

Chandler: What did I just say?

(Joey comes out of his room)

Joey: You still here?

Chandler: Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...

Joey: Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... (loses count and begins to count the number of 'lyings' in the air but gives up.) (yelling) Stop lying!

Chandler: Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?

Joey: (very angry) You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why? (goes back into his room)

Rachel: Well, this is going well. (Chandler looks worried)

Joey: (comes out holding the tape) Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? (puts it into the vcr) If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan. (presses play and he appears on the TV screen and a TV commercial begins)

(The commercial:

Joey says "Ichiban". It displays a few girls dancing around and Joey fills most of the screen, he puts something blue on his lips and smacks them saying "Lipstick For Men!" It goes on to show him playing a guitar and putting on more blue lipstick. In the end he says seductively "Ichiban... Lipstick For Men" and "Sahiko" and it ends. Chandler and Rachel are speechless.)


Joey: (Yelling at Chandler) And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! (goes back to his room and slams the door).

(Silence)

Chandler: He really is a chameleon.
[Scene: Monica's apartment. Phoebe enters carrying the horrific 'painting' of Gladys. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]

 

Phoebe: (smiling from ear to ear) Well, Gladys say hello to your new home! (she holds out the 'painting')

Monica: (faking happiness) Oh, my!

Rachel: (surprised by how ugly it is) Wow! (sarcastic) Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly? (looks around for a spot)


Monica: (sounds desperate, knowing what Rachel is trying to do) I haven't really settled on a spot yet!

Rachel: Well, hey! How about right above the TV? (Points to the spot where her famous French poster is hanging). That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!

Phoebe: (genuinely excited about it) Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.

Monica: (offended) I like that poster!

Phoebe: Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?

Rachel: (jumps at the chance to make that happen) Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!

Monica: (Impatient with Rachel) Are you still here?

[Scene: Ross' office. Ross is pacing and Benjamin enters]



Ross: Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? (Now yelling) Aunt Margaret's pants size?

Benjamin: I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.

Ross: (Sarcastic) No! Stop!

Benjamin: Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.

Ross: (Skeptical) Really?

Benjamin: Well... there is just one small... stipulation...

Ross: I have to break up with Charlie?

Benjamin: Hey, you got one right!

(Ross shakes his head)

Ross: You're crazy.

Benjamin: Crazy, or... romantic?

Ross: Crazy!

Benjamin: Ooor...

Ross: (Yelling) Get out! (Benjamin leaves)
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.]

(Rachel enters, checking the mail, then looks up and sees Gladys placed on the barcalounger.)

Rachel: O-oh my God!

Joey: (enters from his bedroom) What?

Rachel: Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?

Joey: I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.

Rachel: Joey, we're not keeping this!

Joey: But it's an original Buffay...

Rachel: Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.

Joey: Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?

Rachel: Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.

(Joey's eyes are twice their size now, and looks nervously from Rachel to Gladys and back.)

Rachel: She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. (in a spooky, slow voice) And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.

Joey: GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!

(Joey leaves for his bedroom, and Rachel grins. She then takes Gladys and enters Monica's apartment.)

Monica: Hey! I sold that to Joey.

Rachel: Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game. (gives Gladys to Monica)

Monica: No, too late. You can't give it back! (she pushes the painting back to Rachel)

Rachel: Yes I can! (pushes her back again)

Monica: No you can't. She's yours!

Rachel: She's yours!

Monica: SHE'S YOURS!

Rachel: She's yours!

(While they are both pushing the painting towards each other, Phoebe enters)

Phoebe: Hey! (there's a pause)

Rachel: She's mine!

Monica: She's m-i-i-ne!

Rachel: She's mine!

Monica: She's mine!

Phoebe: You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous painting/collage. One of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress and orange gloves reaching out into the room. Around the head 3 small dolls are hovering.) Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis. (Rachel and Monica are gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.)

Rachel: I want Gladys!

Monica: She's mine!

Rachel: She's mine!

Monica: She's mine!

Rachel: She's mine!

[Scene: Rachel and Joey's. Joey's home alone, reading a Sports Illustrated magazine when Chandler enters.]

Chandler: Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.

Joey: That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.

Chandler: I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
[Scene: Central Perk. Monica, Phoebe and Rachel are on the couch.]

Monica: Oh my God!

(we see Joey and Chandler standing there, and Chandler is wearing the blue Ichiban lipstick!)

Rachel: Excellent!

Joey: Now, what do you say?

Chandler: Lying is wrong!

Joey: And?... AND?

Chandler: I'm a pretty little girl.

Phoebe: I knew it!
[Scene: Central Perk. Some time later that day. The group has left and Charlie is there when Ross enters.]

Ross: Your ex-boyfriend is insane.

Charlie: Did you get the grant?

Ross: No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.

Charlie: What?

Ross: Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.

Charlie: Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man.

Ross: Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of "Underdog"?

Charlie: I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.

Ross: If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.

Charlie: Seriously?

Ross: Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?

Charlie: Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O...

Ross: Damnit!
[Scene: Benjamin's office. Ross and Charlie are entering.]

Benjamin: Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here?

Ross: I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!

Benjamin: Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.

Ross: No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.

Charlie: Benji?

Benjamin: Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life.

Ross: Too little, too late, Benji!

Charlie: I can't believe this.

Benjamin: I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?

Ross: (indignant) No!

Charlie: Yes!

Ross: What?

Charlie: I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... romantic.

Ross: or...

Benjamin: Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back?

Charlie: Maybe...

Ross: Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.

Charlie: Oh God! I am so sorry, but... (she puts her hand on Ross's cheek) I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know...

Benjamin: (puts his hand on Ross's other cheek) I'm sorry too...

(Charlie and Benji both let their hands slide down Ross's face, until their hands meet, and they hold hands.)

Benjamin: I love you!

Charlie: I love you too! (and they start to kiss)

Ross: Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!


COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: Joey's bedroom. Joey's asleep with Hugsy, the penguin right next to him.]

(There are scratching and squeaking noises coming from the living room, and Joey wakes up, terrified. He pulls his blanket higher. The doorknob is turning.)

Joey: Gladys?

(The door opens, and there is Gladys, still in her frame though. Joey panics and moves frantically, screaming. Then there is laughing, and the painting is lowered. It was Rachel holding Gladys.)

Rachel: Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old.

Joey: You're mean!

Rachel: Oh, don't be such a baby!

(She closes his door again, and turns around. Then she starts screaming, terrified. There is Glynnis... And Monica holding her up, laughing.)


end
 
Phoebe: (she enters) Hey...

All: Hey!

Rachel: Hi!

Ross: Pheebs, what's wrong?

Phoebe: Oh, I'm just so exhausted from dragging around this... (she shows her ring) HUGE engagement ring!

All: OH!

Rachel: My God!

Joey: Hey!

Rachel: Congratulations! Wow!!

Ross: So, did he get on one knee, did he have a speech prepared, or (in a tender way) did he cry? (the guys look at him) Yeah, big surprise, I like proposals!

Phoebe: Well, it was really sweet, and like the most romantic thing ever.

Joey: Well, hey! Well... (he takes his mug to toast Phoebe) Here's to Phoebe, who's found the greatest guy in the world! To Phoebe and... (a bit uncertain) I wanna say Mike? (pause) To Phoebe and Mike!

All: Whoo!

Phoebe: Thank you! (to Rachel) Oh, and I have something for you!

Rachel: Mmh-mmh!

Phoebe: It's, yes, my little black book. It's got the numbers of all the guys I've dated.

Rachel: Oh, Pheebs, baby, that's nice but, you know what, I think I'm ok. Why don't you give it to one of your other single girlfriends?

Phoebe: I would, but you're the last one.

Rachel: (angrily) GIVE ME THE BOOK! (she takes it and start reading) Pablo Diaz, Brady Smith, huh, "Guy-in-van"?

Phoebe: Oh, my first love!

Rachel: Oh!

Monica: What does the red X next to Bob Greenmore's name mean?

Phoebe: Dead. (everyone is a bit upset) Oh, it's OK, no, he was old, yeah! And he lived a full life, he was in the first wave at Omaha Beach.

Chandler: Hey, I'm sorry, I should have given you guys my black book when I got married! Although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin. With Janice's phone number on it.

Rachel: Phoebe, isn't Jethro Tull a band?

Phoebe: (proud of herself) Oh yes, they are.


OPENING CREDITS
[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]

 

Chandler: (he enters) Hey honey!

Joey: (Looking inside the fridge, and we only see his back. Then he closes the door, and we see it's Joey.) Hi sweetie!

Chandler: Is Monica not here?

Joey: No.

Chandler: Oh, then I'll tell you. My agency was bidding for a big account and they got it! It's my first national commercial!

Joey: Cool!

Chandler: Yeah, and I don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas were mine! (silence) Hell, you weren't there? All the ideas were mine!!!

Joey: That's great! Hey, can you cast me in it?

Chandler: Oh... I don't know, I really don't think you're right for the part.

Joey: What do you mean? I can do anything, I'm a chameleon! Huh? (he mimes an old man with a beard) I'm old! (then he yawns) I'm tired! (then he mimes someone who's hot...) Hey, I'm hot (...and cold) I'm cold!! Huh?? Come on! What can't I do?

Chandler: First of all. Bravo. Uh, but I really don't think you're right for this. The part calls for a stuffy college professor.

Joey: I can do that! (in a deeper voice) "Hello, I'm your professor. When I'm not busy thinking of important things or... professing. I like to use..." Oh, what's the product?

Chandler: Software that facilitates inter-business networking e-solutions?

Joey: (after a long pause he starts miming again) I'm cold!
 

[Scene: Central Perk. Charlie is sitting on the couch and Ross enters.]

 

Ross: (to Charlie) Hey!

Charlie: Hey!

Ross: Guess who's a finalist for a huge research grant! I'll give you a hint, he's looking right at you.

Charlie: Ah, well, unless it's the creepy guy with his hand up his kilt, I'm gonna say congratulations!

Ross: Oh, I'm so excited, I mean, apparently I beat out hundreds of other applicants, included five guys I went to graduate school with. Not that I'm keeping score or anything... five!

Charlie: Wow, that's great! So, tell me about the grant!

Ross: Well, ok, it's for 25 thousand dollars. And if I get it, I'll finally be able to complete my field research! And there will be an article about me in the "Paleontology Review"! Yeah! That'll be the first time my name is in there, without people raising serious questions about my work!

Charlie: Wait. Are you talking about the Dewar grant?

Ross: Yeah. Why?

Charlie: Benjamin Hobart is administering that grant.

Ross: Your ex-boyfriend?

Charlie: Yeah.

Ross: So, your ex-boyfriend is gonna determine if your new boyfriend gets this grant? Wow, your new boyfriend is screwed!

Charlie: No, no, we ended up in great terms. I mean, if anything, I think this could help you. You know what? Why don't we all go out to dinner together, and I can introduce you.

Ross: Well, if you think it would help.

Charlie: Yes, absolutely. I'll call him.

Ross: Ok, now, is there anything I can do to... you know, butter him up? Anything he really likes?

Charlie: Mmh... he does have a pretty serious latex fetish.

Ross: We'll see how dinner goes.

 

[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. She is packing a few tings into boxes.]

Phoebe: (looking at Monica entering) Hey!

Monica: Hey, you wanna go to see a movie?

Phoebe: Well, I told you I had to spend all the day clearing out stuff, so Mike could move in.

Monica: Oh, right.

Phoebe: Yeah.

Monica: Oh, well. Now that I'm here I might as well help you with the cleaning and organizing! Just happen to have my label maker!

Phoebe: Oh, it's so hard to get rid of stuff! Did you and Chandler have to make compromises when you first moved in together?

Monica: Uh, Chandler did! What does he want you to give up?

Phoebe: A bunch of stuff. And the worst one... he wants me to get rid of Gladys.

Monica: Who's Gladys? (Phoebe shows her a horrific painting with a half-a-body girl dummy coming out of the frame. Monica's frightened and she gasps.) Oh! What a tragic loss!

Phoebe: Yeah. I really hate to give her up. Oh, I know!! Oh, you should take her!

Monica: (faking happiness) Well, I-I-I-I... I don't know...

Phoebe: Why, you don't like her?

Monica: Well, of course I do. What's not to like! I'll take her in a minute! But, you know, I think that you're giving up too easy, honey. I think that you need to fight for her!

Phoebe: Really? You think?

Monica: Absolutely! Yes, you say to him "I'm sorry Mike I can't live without her, she means too much to me!"

Phoebe: Ok, I'll fight for her. Ok! Oh, wait, oh I just realized... if I do that, that means you don't get her.

Monica: Damn it, I did not think this through!
[Scene: Central Perk. Rachel, Joey and Emma are there.]

 

Chandler: Hey you guys.

Rachel: Hi!

Joey: Oh! Any word on casting yet?

Chandler: Joe, I told you, you're just not right for the part.

Joey: What do you mean? Rach, don't I seem like a professor you'd buy some kind of e-crap from?

Rachel: I'm sorry, this sounds like something I'm never gonna be interested in.

Joey (to Chandler): Look, c'mon, please? It's not like I'm asking for some crazy favour. This is what I do for a living. I am a professional actor! (he glances at his watch and sees the time) Oh, man, I'm two hours late for work! (he stands, ready to go). Look, here's a copy of my reels. It's got all the commercials that I've been in.

Chandler: Joe...

Joey: Just watch it, and if you don't like it, you don't pass it on to your bosses!

Chandler: Fine!

Joey: Thank you. (he sits down)

Chandler: Work, Joe!

Joey: Damn it! (he leaves)

Chandler (to Rachel): What am I gonna do now?

Joey: Just pass it to your boss!

Chandler: He's not right for the part. So if I suggest him, my bosses are gonna think I'm an idiot! And that's something they should learn on their own!

Rachel: Just tell Joey that you watched the tape and you liked it, but your bosses didn't. Then that way, you're the good guy and they're the bad guys.

Chandler: That's good! I liked it, they didn't. (he sees Joey out of the window hitting on a girl) Joey, for God's sake, go to work! (Joey runs away).
[Scene: A restaurant. Ross and Charlie are waiting for her ex-boyfriend, Benjamin Hobart]

 


Ross: I can't believe I'm about to meet Benjamin Hobart. I've always thought of him as one of the people I'd invite to my fantasy dinner party. Do you think there's any chance he'll bring Christie Brinkley or C3PO?

Charlie: (glances over Ross' shoulder) Sorry, looks like it's just him.

Benjamin: Charlie! My God, you look absolutely stunning!

Ross: Well, I... I am having a good hair day.

Benjamin: So good to see you.

Charlie: Me too. (she and Benjamin are hugging for very long and Ross starts pretending to clear his throat, until they stop)

Ross: I'm ok.

Charlie: I'm sorry... (introduces them to each other) Ross Geller... Benjamin Hobart.

Ross: It's an honor to meet you. I can't tell you how long I've been an admirer of your work, I mean, that Nobel prize, (he thumbs up) whoooo! I mean, I have to tell you that, you're one of the reasons I got into the field.

Benjamin: Oh, well, likewise. Actually, not likewise. I've never heard of you until this morning, but, it's nice to be nice!

Charlie: Shall we? (they sit down and Benjamin takes Ross' chair).

Benjamin: (to Ross) Thank you! (to Charlie). I can't believe that you chose this restaurant! Do you remember the night?

Charlie: Oh my God, I completely forgot! (they laugh) Oh my God! I can't believe they let us back in this place! (they laugh more, and Ross start laughing too).

Benjamin (to Ross): You weren't there!

Ross: No, but, it's, you know, it's just a funny image, you know, the two of you, in this restaurant, with... (laughs nervously)tzz-zzz, mmm.

Charlie: Ross, why don't you tell Benji about your proposal, while I go to the ladies room?

Benjamin: So, tell me about it.

Ross: Ok well, I would like to do a dig in the painted desert.

Benjamin: M-m.

Ross: See, there are still several areas that haven't been fully excavated.

Benjamin: Break up with Charlie!

Ross: What?

Benjamin: What?

Ross: Did you just say "break up with Charlie"?

Benjamin: Well, yes, and now. Yes I did say it, and no, I didn't not say it.

Ross: Kind of inappropriate, don't you think?

Benjamin: I'm sorry. I just haven't seen her for so long! All these feelings are rushing back! I'm starting to realize how much I missed her, and I'm gonna need you to break up with her.

Ross: Are you serious?

Benjamin: If you say yes then I'm serious, if you say no then I'm joking!

Ross: No!

Benjamin: Joking it is!
[Scene: Monica's apartment. Phoebe enters the room.]

 

Phoebe: Hi! Sorry, I'm late.

Monica: Hey, how did it go with Mike, is he gonna let you keep the painting?

Phoebe: No, he really hates it. But he's gonna let me keep my box of human hair! So you got to pick your battles. But the good news is, Gladys is yours!

Monica: Wow, what's the bad news!

Rachel: Who's Gladys?

Phoebe: Oh, she's that work of art I made, you know, with the woman coming out of the frame.

Rachel: (sarcastic) Oh, and Monica gets to keep her? In her house? I am so jealous!

Phoebe: Oh, I didn't know you wanted her too!

Monica: Huh!

Rachel: Well, I mean, sure, of course. But... you already gave that to Monica, so...

Monica: You know, I would give her up, for you.

Rachel: No, I couldn't let you do that.

Monica: But I want to.

Rachel: But I don't want you to.

Monica: But I insist!

Rachel: But I insist harder!

Phoebe: Girls, girls, stop, ok? We'll flip a coin. Heads, she's Rachel's, tails she's Monica's. (she flips the coin). Tails! Monica, she's yours!

Monica: No, that landed in your food!

Rachel: (sarcastic) No, no, that's ok. You won fair and square. I'm so sad!
[Scene: Chandler walks into Joey's apartment]

 

Chandler: Hey Joe!

Joey: What's up?

Chandler: Bad news. I watched the tape and passed it along to my bosses and they weren't interested.

Joey: (sounds disappointed) Oh.

Chandler: (Hands the tape back to him) I'm sorry man.

Joey: (looks at him suspiciously) But, ehm... you watched the tape?

Chandler: (sounds nervous) Yeah! I... I... I liked it! (Joey continues to look at him suspiciously) But, ehm... my bosses didn't go for it. Stupid sons of bitches!

Joey: (sounds confident) You didn't watch the tape.

Chandler: (looks surprised) What!? Of course I did!

Joey: Look, it's one thing not to cast me, but to lie to me?

Chandler: I'm not lying to you, I watched it!

Joey: Well, you lied again! (Rachel comes out of her room and is observing the conversation)

Chandler: I watched it!

Joey: Keep going Pinocchio!

Chandler: (now yelling) (pretending to look shocked) I did!

Joey: (yelling back) No you didn't! (turns and goes towards his room)

Chandler: (following him) I'm telling you, I watched the tape. (Reaches Joey's room and Joey slams the door in his face)

Rachel: Did you watch the tape?

Chandler:(In a sarcastic "of course not"!-tone) No!
[Scene: Interview room. Ross and two other professors (one man, one woman) are sitting on one side of a long desk. Benjamin Hobart is sitting on the other side]

 

Benjamin: The selection committee has chosen the three of you as our finalists today. The ultimate decision will be based upon the answers you give to the questions I ask here. I'm gonna start with Dr. Li. Dr. Li, you claim the field is too reliant on the Linnaean taxonomic system. How do you propose to correct this problem?

Dr. Li: Well, I believe that the answers lie in the osteological evidence. I plan to begin there.

Benjamin: (nods) Interesting.

Ross: (Rolls his eyes) I guess!

Benjamin: Dr. Biely, your proposal includes some field work. Where might that take place?

Dr. Biely: Primarily in the Pierre Shale region of South Dakota.

Benjamin: Certainly. Very well. And Dr. Geller, when is my birthday?

Ross: (shocked and confused by the question) What? I... I... (Benjamin looks at him as if to say "What's wrong? Answer the question")

Benjamin: Care to venture a guess?

Ross: (annoyed) May 12th?

Benjamin: (looks surprised and un-impressed) That's not even kinda close! (Ross looks around confused) Dr. Li, how many graduate students you'd be needing?

Dr. Li: Half a dozen.

Benjamin: I see, and Dr. Biely?

Dr. Biely: Three for excavation and two for analysis.

Benjamin: Certainly. Dr. Geller, which 1965 Shirelles hit was later covered by a popular British invasion band?

Ross: (even more shocked) Wha..? I need 6 graduate students.

Benjamin: No! I'm sorry, we were looking for "Baby It's You". Baby It's You.

Ross: Wha...? Wait, wait, wait, just a minute. None of my questions have anything to do with Paleontology.

Benjamin: You're right, I apologize. Scratch the last question. Spell "Boscodictiasaur".

Ross: (annoyed) um... I've never heard of a "Boscodictiasaur".

Benjamin: Yeah, I just made it up. Spell it.

Ross: (stares at him angrily) Ok. (determined to spell it correctly) B - O - S ...

Benjamin: No, it starts with a silent "M".

Ross: Oh come on!!
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment. Chandler and Rachel are talking.]

 

Chandler: I can't believe Joey. I hate being called a liar!

Rachel: But you are a liar.

Chandler: What did I just say?

(Joey comes out of his room)

Joey: You still here?

Chandler: Yes, and I have to say, I am not just hurt. I am insulted. When I tell somebody I did something...

Joey: Ok whoah-hey... Let me just stop you right there, ok? First, you lied, right? Then, you lied about lying, ok? Then you lied about lying about lying, ok? So before you lie about lying about lying about lying about... lying... (loses count and begins to count the number of 'lyings' in the air but gives up.) (yelling) Stop lying!

Chandler: Why are you so sure I didn't watch this tape?

Joey: (very angry) You wanna know wh...? You wanna know why? (goes back into his room)

Rachel: Well, this is going well. (Chandler looks worried)

Joey: (comes out holding the tape) Here's how I know you didn't watch the tape, ok? (puts it into the vcr) If you had seen what was on this tape, believe me, you would have some comments. Alright, now remember, I got paid a lot of money for this and it only aired in Japan. (presses play and he appears on the TV screen and a TV commercial begins)

(The commercial:

Joey says "Ichiban". It displays a few girls dancing around and Joey fills most of the screen, he puts something blue on his lips and smacks them saying "Lipstick For Men!" It goes on to show him playing a guitar and putting on more blue lipstick. In the end he says seductively "Ichiban... Lipstick For Men" and "Sahiko" and it ends. Chandler and Rachel are speechless.)


Joey: (Yelling at Chandler) And that's how I know you didn't watch the tape! (goes back to his room and slams the door).

(Silence)

Chandler: He really is a chameleon.
[Scene: Monica's apartment. Phoebe enters carrying the horrific 'painting' of Gladys. Monica and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]

 

Phoebe: (smiling from ear to ear) Well, Gladys say hello to your new home! (she holds out the 'painting')

Monica: (faking happiness) Oh, my!

Rachel: (surprised by how ugly it is) Wow! (sarcastic) Oh, she's so nice and big! Oh, Monica, where are you going to display Gladys oh so proudly? (looks around for a spot)


Monica: (sounds desperate, knowing what Rachel is trying to do) I haven't really settled on a spot yet!

Rachel: Well, hey! How about right above the TV? (Points to the spot where her famous French poster is hanging). That way, it will be the first thing that you see when you walk in the door!

Phoebe: (genuinely excited about it) Yeah, yeah! And you can get rid of that French poster.

Monica: (offended) I like that poster!

Phoebe: Really? It doesn't have anything coming out of it. Or maybe there is some place for her in your bedroom?

Rachel: (jumps at the chance to make that happen) Oh! There's nothing above your bed!!

Monica: (Impatient with Rachel) Are you still here?

[Scene: Ross' office. Ross is pacing and Benjamin enters]



Ross: Oh hi! Hello! Uh, have you come to ask me some more paleontology related questions? Uhm... your grandmother's nickname, perhaps? (Now yelling) Aunt Margaret's pants size?

Benjamin: I've come here to apologize. I think I may have let my feelings for Charlie interfere with the interview process.

Ross: (Sarcastic) No! Stop!

Benjamin: Anyway, I've decided to offer you the grant.

Ross: (Skeptical) Really?

Benjamin: Well... there is just one small... stipulation...

Ross: I have to break up with Charlie?

Benjamin: Hey, you got one right!

(Ross shakes his head)

Ross: You're crazy.

Benjamin: Crazy, or... romantic?

Ross: Crazy!

Benjamin: Ooor...

Ross: (Yelling) Get out! (Benjamin leaves)
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's apartment.]

(Rachel enters, checking the mail, then looks up and sees Gladys placed on the barcalounger.)

Rachel: O-oh my God!

Joey: (enters from his bedroom) What?

Rachel: Joey, what... is... this...thing... doing here?

Joey: I got it from Monica. She sold it to me for a very reasonable price.

Rachel: Joey, we're not keeping this!

Joey: But it's an original Buffay...

Rachel: Alright, fine. You can keep it. As long as you don't mind that she's haunted.

Joey: Hey? what? what? wey! whoo! what? what!?

Rachel: Well, legend has it Joey, that... she comes alive when you're asleep.

(Joey's eyes are twice their size now, and looks nervously from Rachel to Gladys and back.)

Rachel: She climbs out of the frame, and then drags her half-a-body across the floor, just looking for legs to steal. (in a spooky, slow voice) And then with her one good hand, she slo-o-owly re-e-a-aches up and turns your doorknob.

Joey: GET THAT LEGLESS WITCH OUT OF HERE!

(Joey leaves for his bedroom, and Rachel grins. She then takes Gladys and enters Monica's apartment.)

Monica: Hey! I sold that to Joey.

Rachel: Well, why I told him it's haunted. Two can play at this game. (gives Gladys to Monica)

Monica: No, too late. You can't give it back! (she pushes the painting back to Rachel)

Rachel: Yes I can! (pushes her back again)

Monica: No you can't. She's yours!

Rachel: She's yours!

Monica: SHE'S YOURS!

Rachel: She's yours!

(While they are both pushing the painting towards each other, Phoebe enters)

Phoebe: Hey! (there's a pause)

Rachel: She's mine!

Monica: She's m-i-i-ne!

Rachel: She's mine!

Monica: She's mine!

Phoebe: You guys! You guys! You don't have to fight over her anymore. (she goes out into the hallway and enters with an even more hideous painting/collage. One of those faceles mannequins heads wearing a blueish dress and orange gloves reaching out into the room. Around the head 3 small dolls are hovering.) Whoever doesn't get Gladys gets Glynnis. (Rachel and Monica are gasping for air at the sight of this monstrous piece of art.)

Rachel: I want Gladys!

Monica: She's mine!

Rachel: She's mine!

Monica: She's mine!

Rachel: She's mine!

[Scene: Rachel and Joey's. Joey's home alone, reading a Sports Illustrated magazine when Chandler enters.]

Chandler: Look, I'm sorry I didn't give them your tape. And I promise, next time to submit you whether I think you are right for the part or not.

Joey: That's not the point Chandler. The point is that you lied.

Chandler: I know. You're right. What's it gonna take for you to forgive me?
[Scene: Central Perk. Monica, Phoebe and Rachel are on the couch.]

Monica: Oh my God!

(we see Joey and Chandler standing there, and Chandler is wearing the blue Ichiban lipstick!)

Rachel: Excellent!

Joey: Now, what do you say?

Chandler: Lying is wrong!

Joey: And?... AND?

Chandler: I'm a pretty little girl.

Phoebe: I knew it!
[Scene: Central Perk. Some time later that day. The group has left and Charlie is there when Ross enters.]

Ross: Your ex-boyfriend is insane.

Charlie: Did you get the grant?

Ross: No I didn't, and you want to know why? Because your ex-boyfriend is still in love with you.

Charlie: What?

Ross: Yeah. He wouldn't give me the grant, because I wouldn't give you up.

Charlie: Benji isn't in love with me. I mean, he broke up with me. And besides, he's a very ethical man.

Ross: Really? Is it ethical to ask someone in a grant review, who was the voice of "Underdog"?

Charlie: I'm sure he was just joking, Ross.

Ross: If you don't believe me, let's go talk to him, okay? I'm telling you, he didn't ask me one paleontological question.

Charlie: Seriously?

Ross: Oh, I'm sorry, no. He did ask me one. Uhm... How do you spell Mboscodictiosaur?

Charlie: Well, if it's like the lake Mbosco in Congo, then M-B-O...

Ross: Damnit!
[Scene: Benjamin's office. Ross and Charlie are entering.]

Benjamin: Dr. Geller...? Charlie... What are you... what are you doing here?

Ross: I want you to tell her everything. About the deal you tried to make with me, about the crazy questions you... Wally Cox! That's the voice of Underdog!

Benjamin: Like I tried to tell you in the interview Ross, this grant is not based on your knowledge of pretty useless trivia.

Ross: No, no, no. Don't do that! I want you to look her in the eyes, and tell her the truth.

Charlie: Benji?

Benjamin: Alright, it's true. I behaved horribly. But it's only because I still love you. And I would do anything to have you back in my life.

Ross: Too little, too late, Benji!

Charlie: I can't believe this.

Benjamin: I never should have broken up with you. I think about you all the time. I mean, do you ever still think about me?

Ross: (indignant) No!

Charlie: Yes!

Ross: What?

Charlie: I don't know what to say, Benji. This is all so.... romantic.

Ross: or...

Benjamin: Listen, I know, I may be way out of bounds here, but is there any chance you will take me back?

Charlie: Maybe...

Ross: Sweetie, this conversation is starting to make me a little uncomfortable.

Charlie: Oh God! I am so sorry, but... (she puts her hand on Ross's cheek) I mean it's... there's so much history between us, you know...

Benjamin: (puts his hand on Ross's other cheek) I'm sorry too...

(Charlie and Benji both let their hands slide down Ross's face, until their hands meet, and they hold hands.)

Benjamin: I love you!

Charlie: I love you too! (and they start to kiss)

Ross: Okay, that's it. WE ARE SEEING OTHER PEOPLE!


COMMERCIAL BREAK
[Scene: Joey's bedroom. Joey's asleep with Hugsy, the penguin right next to him.]

(There are scratching and squeaking noises coming from the living room, and Joey wakes up, terrified. He pulls his blanket higher. The doorknob is turning.)

Joey: Gladys?

(The door opens, and there is Gladys, still in her frame though. Joey panics and moves frantically, screaming. Then there is laughing, and the painting is lowered. It was Rachel holding Gladys.)

Rachel: Ha ha ha, third time this week. Man, this does not get old.

Joey: You're mean!

Rachel: Oh, don't be such a baby!

(She closes his door again, and turns around. Then she starts screaming, terrified. There is Glynnis... And Monica holding her up, laughing.)
