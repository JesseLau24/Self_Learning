Ross: Well, it was loong. I didnât even realise how late it was, until I noticed the 5 oâclock shadow on her head. (They both start to laugh, then stop themselves quickly.) Anyway, she didnât want to stay. I called a cab; she just left.

(They kiss.)

Rachel: I wrote you a letter.

Ross: Ohh! Thank you! I like mail. (He goes to kiss her again, but she turns away.)

Rachel: (handing him the letter) Itâs just some things Iâve been thinking about. Some things about us, and before we can even think about the two of us getting back together, I just need to know how you feel about this stuff.

Ross: Okay. (He leans in to kiss her again, but she leans back preventing him from making contact.) Wow, itâs-itâs 5:30 in the morning. (Rachel laughs) So, Iâd better get cracking on this baby.

Ross: Iâm sorry.

Rachel: Does it?

Ross: Does it? Does it? Yeah, I wanted to give that whole âDoes it?â part just another glance.

Ross: (interrupting) No, Rach, no. I donât, I donât, I donât have to think about it, in fact, Iâve decided, Iâve decided that, that it.......does.

But this break-up was not all my fault, and she, she says here, (reading from the letter) âIf you accept full responsibility...â (to Chandler and Joey) Full responsibility! â...I can begin to trust you again. Does that seem like something you can do. (yells at Joey) Does it?!!â

Joey: No?

Chandler: Look, Ross, you have what you want, youâre back with Rachel. If you bring this up now youâre gonna wreck the best thing that even happened to you.

Ross: (calming down) Yeah, I know. I mean, no, youâre right. Yeah I guess Iâll let it go. But you-you understand how-how hard it is to forget about this.

Joey: Sure, itâs hard to forget! But that doesnât mean you have to talk about it! A lot of things happened on that trip that we should never, (to Chandler) ever talk about.

Joey: Thatâs right I stepped up! Sheâs my friend and she needed help! And if I had too, Iâd pee on anyone of you! Only, uhh, I couldnât. I got the stage fright. I wanted to help, but there was too much pressure. So-so I uh, I turned to Chandler.

Chandler: (wails loudly into his hands) Joey kept screaming at me, âDo it now! Do it!! Do it! Do it now!!â Sometimes late at night I can still here the screaming.

Chandler: (looks at him) Nooo.

Joey: Oh. What do you do?

Chandler: I canât believe you donât know what I do for a living!

Phoebe: Yeah, I actually donât know...

Ross: Good, so do I

Rachel: Something to do with numbers?

[Cut to someone entering Central Perk which lets a cat in. The cat then runs over to Phoebeâs guitar case and starts sniffing around.]

Phoebe: Oh my God! No! Shoo! Kitty! No! No-no-no! Shoo! Come on, you! (goes over and picks up the cat) Come on. Crazy. (looks into the catâs eyes) Oh my God.

Rachel: What?

Phoebe: Nothing. Nothing.

Joey: What? Whatâs wrong?

Phoebe: I just, I just have this really strong feeling that this cat is my Mother.

Rachel: You mean the mom you met in Montauk. She was a cat?!

Phoebe: No, no-no, she was a human lady. This is the spirit of my Mom Lily, the one who killed herself.

Ross: Are you sure sheâs in the cat, or have you been taking your grandmaâs glycoma medicine again?

Phoebe: No Dr. Skeptismo! Iâm sure. First of all, okay, thereâs the feeling. (Chandler shrugs) Okay, and for another, how about the fact that she went into my guitar case which is lined with orange felt. (Rachel nods her head in unsure agreement) My Motherâs favourite fish is Orange Roughy... (Joey thinks he understands, but then nods that he has no clue.) Cats....like....fish! (Ross and Rachel are totally lost) (to the cat) Hi, Mommy. (Rachel covers her mouth, in an âOh my God.â gesture) Oh, I havenât seen this smile in 17 years!

Joey: (to Chandler) Dude, Phoebeâs mom has got a huge peni...

Chandler: (interrupting) Let it go!!

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is working as Monica enters.]

Monica: Hey!

Rachel: Umm, when were you gonna tell me that youâre going out with Chip Matthews?

Monica: Now? Is it okay if I go out with Chip Matthews?

Rachel: Nooo! Itâs not okay! I canât believe you would want to after what he did to me!

Monica: What, that little thing at the prom?

Rachel: Monica! I couldnât find him for two hours! He was having sex with Amy Welch!

Monica: Come on, that was back in high school! How could that still bother you?

Rachel: I mean why, of all people would you want to go out with Chip?!

Monica: Look, you and I went to different high schools...

Rachel: Okay, that doesnât help me, because we went to the same high school.

Monica: You went to one where you were popular, and you got to ride off Chipâs motorcycle, and wear his letterman jacket. I went to one where I wore a band uniform they had to have specially made.

Rachel: (shocked) They had to have that specially made?!

Monica: It was a project for one of the Home Ec classes.

Rachel: (stunned) Oh my God, they told us that was for the mascot!

Monica: Back then, I thought that I would never, ever get the chance to go out with a Chip Matthews, and now heâs-heâs called me up and asked me out. And the fat girl inside of me really wants to go. I-I owe her this. I never let her eat.

Rachel: Oh, you go out with him. (goes over and hugs her)

Monica: Oh, really?!

Rachel: Yeah. Just, if itâs possible, could you leave him somewhere and go have sex with another guy?

Monica: Iâll try.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, they are all there eating breakfast.]

Ross: So you guys having any luck getting rid of the entertainment center?

Joey: Well, there were a couple of calls last night, but ah, I donât think any of them are gonna work out.

Chandler: Yes, Joey has a very careful screening process. Apparently, not everyone is qualified to own wood and nails.

Phoebe: (is struggling with the cat) Stop it! Stop it! She keeps squirming, trying to get away! Just like when she was alive.

Ross: So Pheebs, how long is your mom gonna be with us?

Phoebe: Well, Iâm not sure. I mean, I guess until she y'know, gets used to the fact that thereâs y'know, a new mom. Y'know, I think sheâs worried that y'know, sheâs gonna, sheâs gonna be replaced. (to the cat, in a funny voice) Well, thatâs not gonna happen is it? Noo. (gets up) Okay, I have to return a call in the other room.

Monica: Why canât you use the phone in here?

Phoebe: Well, Iâm returning a call from a certain mom at the B-E-A-C-H. I just spelled the wrong word. (goes into Monicaâs room)

Ross: So, guys, am I crazy, or does Phoebeâs mom remind anyone of a cat?

Monica: Ross, donât start.

Ross: Come on, you-you canât tell me you actually believe that-that thereâs a woman inside that cat!

Rachel: I believe it.

Ross: No you donât.

Rachel: Yes, I do.

Ross: No you doây'know what, youâre not gonna suck me into this.

Rachel: Oh sure I am, because you always have to be right.

Ross: I do not always have to beâokay, okay. (starts to leave)

Rachel: Jurassic Park could happen.

(Ross wants to say something, but just smiles and leaves.)

Tony: Wow! Thatâs ah, thatâs pretty nice!

Joey: Pretty nice?

Chandler: Youâll have to pardon my roommate, he wanted to marry this.

Tony: We donât have 50 bucks, but would you be willing to trade for it? Weâve got a canoe.

(Joey jumps up in excitement and without turning around Chandler holds out his hand stopping him, and ushering him back into his seat. Joey sits down, dejected.)

Chandler: Y'know, I, I really donât think we need a canoe.

Tony: You gotta take the canoe!

Chandler: All right, just, just take the entertainment center, and then when you get home, throw the canoe away!

Peter: Weâre not throwing it away! I built that canoe! (starts to leave as Tony chases after him)

Joey: (to Peter) Good for you!!

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Monica, and Ross are there.]

Ross: (taking the flyer) Apparently Phoebeâs mother also goes by the name Julio.

Rachel: You guys, thereâs a little girl in Soho looking for this cat. I mean, you know what that means?!

Joey: (looking at the flyer) Yeah-eah! 200 dollar reward, split five ways!!

Rachel: Do we have to tell her?

Ross: Yes, we have to tell her!

Monica: Oh, but itâs made her so happy.

Ross: (holds up a hand) Little girl misses her cat. (hold up the other hand) Crazy lady thinks her mother is in a cat. (gets up) Okay, y'know what, I have to go have dinner with my son, can I trust that when you see Phoebe, you will tell her.

All: (disappointed) Yeah.

Ross: Thank you.

Rachel: I hate when Ross is right!

Monica: He is right, isnât he?

Chandler: Y'know what, I think this might be one of the times heâs wrong.

All: You think?

Chandler: Oh-no, heâs right.

Guy: What?!

Joey: Oh yeah! I got in there myself once. My roommate bet me five bucks that I couldnât, and then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me in. Yeah. It was funny âtil I started feeling like I was in a coffin.

Guy: No, you, you canât fit in that thing. Thatâs not deep enough.

Joey: Oh yeah? (opens up the center and takes out the stereo) If I canât, Iâll knock five bucks off the price off the unit.

Guy: All right, you have yourself a deal. (shakes his hand)

Joey: Okay. (he gets in the unit and closes the door) See?! I told ya!

Phoebe: (she turns around and puts the cat on the entertainment center) Ross, how many parents have you lost?

Ross: None.

Phoebe: Okay, then you donât know what it feels like when one of them comes back. Do you? I believe this is my Mother. Even if Iâm wrong, who cares? Just be a friend. Okay? Be supportive.

Ross: Iâm sorry.

Phoebe: Okay.

Ross: I donât know what to say.

Rachel: You could.... say youâre sorry to her mom.

Phoebe: I think she would like that.

Ross: (goes over to Julio) Come here, here, come here, come here, (pause) Mrs. Buffay. Sorry, about what I said, umm, it was, it was insensitive of me to say that you were just a cat. When clearly you are also the reincarnated spirit, of my friendâs mother.

Phoebe: Thank you. We both forgive you.

Rachel: So honey, what are you gonna do about the little girl?

Phoebe: Yeah, okay, listen, umm, Mom, I hope you know you still mean a lot to me. And youâre welcome to come back anytime.

Rachel: Oh! Good thing Chandlerâs not here, he always wins at this game.

Monica: I just told my Mom Iâd cater a party for her.

Phoebe: How come?

Monica: Because I need the money, and I thought that itâd be a great way to get rid of that last little schmidgen of self-respect.

Ross: Come on, I think this is a good thing. I donât think Mom wouldâve hired you if she didnât think you were good at what you do.

Chandler: Well, not at first.

Rachel: What is she doing here?

(Joey makes a sound like a creaking bed.)

Rachel: I donât understand! Last time you went out with her you said she was a âbig, dull dud.â

Chandler: Well, I think I judged her too quickly, and this time we were able to take the relationship to the next level.

(Joey creaks louder)

Rachel: Well, last time I almost got fired. You must end it, you must end it now!

Chandler: Oh, come on! Itâs not like this is an everyday occurrence for me! I mean usually Iâm pretty much just in there by myself.

Rachel: Chandler!! (He turns around quickly) Promise me, you will end it.

Chandler: Okay, I promise, Iâll end it.

Rachel: Thank you.

Chandler: I hope you know what Iâm giving up for ya, because sheâs not just the boss in your office, if you know what I mean.

Monica: Let me ask you a question.

Mrs. Geller: Hmm.

Monica: Why did you hire me?

Mrs. Geller: Oh, well Richard raved about the food at his party, of course you were sleeping with him. Then I heard the food at that lesbian wedding was very nice, I assume you werenât sleeping with anybody there. Though, at least that would be something. (Leaves)

Monica: (to Phoebe) Oh my God! Did you hear that? She hired me because she thinks Iâm good.

Phoebe: Okay, I didnât hear that.

Monica: Oh yeah, she didnât hire me out of pity, it wasnât so she could pick on me in front of her friends, she actually thinks Iâm good.

Joey: No! No. But ah, try the classifieds, people sell everything in there.

Monica: (Looks at her nails) Oh my God. Wait a minute, I had them putâ¦ (realises) Oh my God! Itâs in the quiche! Oh My God!

Phoebe: Okay, donât panic. Iâm gonna go to the store, Iâm gonna get you another set of nails, no oneâs gonna know, and youâre gonna look great. (She runs over to get her coat.) Oh! Oh, itâs âcause theyâre gonna eatâthatâs the problem.

Mrs. Geller: (entering) (to Monica) Honey, donât bite your nails.

Monica: Okay ah, please donât freak out. Umm, but ah, thereâs a blue fingernail in one of the quiche cups, and thereâs no way to know which one.

Phoebe: And! Whoever finds it wins the prize!

Mrs. Geller: (laughs) Iâm not freaking out.

Monica: Then why are you laughing?

Mrs. Geller: Itâs nothing, itâs just that now your Father owes me five dollars.

Monica: What? You bet Iâd lose a nail?

Mrs. Geller: Oh no, donât be silly. I just bet Iâd need these. (Opens the freezer to revealâ¦)

Monica: Frozen lasagnas?

Mrs. Geller: Um-hmm.

Monica: You bet that Iâd screw up?! So all that stuff about hiring me because I was good wasâ¦

Mrs. Geller: No-no-no, that was all true. This was just in case you pulled a Monica.

Monica: You promised Dr. Weinburg, youâd never use that phrase.

Mrs. Geller: Oh honey, come on, have a sense of humour, youâve never been able to laugh at yourself.

Monica: (laughs) Thatâs right. My Mom doesnât have any faith in me! Oh, thatâs hilarious! Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

Phoebe: I donât get it.

Mrs. Geller: No, I have faithâ¦

Joanna: Why?

Chandler: When I walk outside naked people throw garbage at me.

Joanna: Wait. I wanna show you something.

Chandler: What is it?

Joanna: Just a little gag gift somebody gave me. (Sheâs holding a pair of handcuffs) Put your hands together.

Chandler: Ah-ha, youâre not the boss of me. (She kisses him) Yeah, you are! (She handcuffs him to the chair) Ooh, saucy.

Joanna: (kisses him) Iâll be back in ten minutes. (Starts to leave)

Chandler: You are, youâre gonna leave me like this?

Joanna: Knowing youâre here, waiting for me I think itâs kinda exciting.

Chandler: Okay. But if you donât come back soon, (She leaves and closes the door) thereâs pretty much nothing I can do about it!

[Cut to Joannaâs outer office, where Rachel and Sophie work. They are both coming back from lunch.]

Joanna: (locking her door) Oh.

Sophie: Hi! I brought you back a macaroon!

Joanna: Oh great! Iâll keep it in my butt with your nose. (She grabs the cookie and walks out.)

Rachel: Thatâs weird, she locked the door.

Sophie: Yâknow why? Sheâs got the Christmas bonus list in there. I saw her working on it this morning.

Rachel: Okay, swear you wonât tell, but when Mark left he gave me a key to Joannaâs office. Do you wanna see the list?

Sophie: Yeah!

(Rachel unlocks and opens the door to reveal a half-naked Chandler handcuffed to the chair. They both gasp and Chandler stares at them in shock and surprise.)

Chandler: (in a serious, businesslike tone) Rachel, could I see you for a moment?

(Rachel goes into talk to Chandler.)

Chandler: Okay, hereâs the situation. The keys to the cuffs are on the back of the door. Could you be a doll and grab them and scoot on over and unlock me? And on a totally different subject, that is a lovely pantsuit.

Rachel: You promised you would break up with her!

Chandler: I did break up with her! She just took it really, really well!

Rachel: And the fact that you were jeopardising my career never entered your mind?!

Chandler: It did enter my mind! But then something happened that made it, shoot right out.

Rachel: Y'know what Chandler, you got yourself into those cuffs, you get yourself out of them.

Chandler: No-no-no-no-no-no-no!! I canât get myself right out of them! You must have me confused with the Amazing Chandler!! Come on, you have to unlock me, she could be gone for hours, and Iâm cold, and (Stops and looks up the skirt on a statue behind Joannaâs desk.)

Chandler: Never!

Rachel: You never come into this office again!

Chandler: Fine!

Chandler: You got it! Here we go! Come on! This is great! (Rachel goes over and unlocks the handcuffs) Ahhh! (He starts rubbing his wrist)

Rachel: Does it hurt?

Chandler: No, I just always see guys doing this when they get handcuffs taken off them. (He runs over to where his pants are hanging) Hello sweet pants!

Rachel: Wait a minute! What are you gonna tell Joanna?

Chandler: About what?

Rachel: When she sees that youâre gone, sheâs gonna know that I let you out, and that I was in here, and Iâm gonna get fired!

Chandler: Iâll make something up! Iâm good at lying, I actually did borrow your Walkman!

Rachel: No, thereâs nothing to make up, sheâs gonna know that I have a key to her office, Iâve got to get you locked up back the way you were! (She tries to drag him over to the chair, but Chandler stops her.)

Chandler: Oh-ho-ho, I donât think so!

(He starts to put his pants on, but Rachel manages to drag him to the chair. When they get to the chair, Chandler drops his pants and knocks the chair away. Rachel then backs him up and locks him to the top drawer of a filing cabinet.)

Chandler: Well, this is much better.

The Salesman: And?

Joey: Iâm out.

The Salesman: He painted that. (Points to one of his paintings in the book)

Phoebe: Well, who cares what your Mom thinks? So you pulled a Monica.

Monica: Oh good, Iâm glad thatâs catching on.

Phoebe: No but, why does that have to be a bad thing. Just change what it means. Y'know? Go down there and prove your Mother wrong. Finish the job you were hired to do, and weâll call that pulling a Monica.

Monica: What?

Phoebe: Okay, umm, if a kid gets straight Aâs, his parents would say, "Yeah, he pulled a Monica." Y'know? Or a fireman saves a baby, and they go, "Yeah I know, he pulled a Monica." Or someone hits a homerun and the announcer says, "Yeah, that oneâs outta here." Though some things donât change.

Monica: (getting up) All right, Iâll go down there. But, Iâm not gonna serve the lasagna. Iâm gonna serve something I make.

(She exits and Phoebe goes over and sits down at the machine that works your shoulders and tries to do one, which she does, easily.)

Chandler: Hey, look, youâre in trouble either way! Okay? If she comes back and sees me locked to this instead of the chair, sheâs gonna know you were in here. So you might as well just let me go.

Rachel: What if I clean your bathroom for a month?

Chandler: It still wouldnât be clean. (Rachel makes an âEww, disgusting!â face) All I want is my freedom.

The Salesman: So, what do you say, Joey? You get the whole set of encyclopedias for twelve hundred dollars, which works out to just 50 bucks a book!

Joey: Twelve hundred dollars? You think I have $1200? Iâm home in the middle of the day, and I got patio furniture in my living room. I guess thereâs a few things you donât get from book learninâ.

The Salesman: Well ah, what can you swing?

Joey: How about zero down and zero a month for a long, long time?

The Salesman: You donât have, anything?

Joey: You wanna see what I got? (He gets up to empty out his pockets) Okay? Iâve got a baby Tootsie Roll, a movie stub, keys, a Kleenex, a rock, and an army man. Hey!

Phoebe: But, I need your germs! I want my cold back! I miss my sexy voice.

Monica: Sorry, Phoebe.

Phoebe: It's okay. How's the soup?

Monica: Umm. (nodding her head, "Good.")

(Monica sets the soup down and Phoebe picks it up and licks the rim.)

Monica: Ohhhh!! Gross!!

[Scene: A nightclub, Chandler is having dinner with Kathy and Joey.]

Kathy: Ohh, God, guys, check it out, you can see that girl's underwear!

Joey: Is she great or what?

Kathy: (to Chandler) So? Huh? What do you think?

Chandler: Ohh, she's-she's not really my type.

Kathy: Not your type?! She's gorgeous!

Chandler: Y'know what I think it is? It's the fishnet stockings. Y'know? Whenever I see a girl in fishnet stockings it reminds me of my father in fishnet stockings.

Kathy: Okay. Understanding a little more why you're single. Ohh! Y'know, I have a friend you would like, she's really pretty. And then we could double date!

Chandler: Uhh, no-no thanks.

Kathy: Okay, I've got some ugly friends, and they're all available too.

Chandler: Listen, I-I'm gonna grab a beer. (Leaves)

Joey: (to Kathy) I'll be right back. (to Chandler) What was that?

Chandler: What?

Joey: Kathy was being really nice and you just walked away. I thought we had a deal.

Chandler: Hey, look, what do you want from me?

Joey: I want you to like her! But if that's too damned difficult for you, then the least you can do is pretend.

Chandler: I am pretending.

Joey: Well then, do it better!

Chandler: Okay, what do you saw I go over there and say how much I like her? (Joey gives him a thumbs up) No-no it'll be good, I can tell her much I've been thinking about her. That I haven't stopped thinking about her since the moment I met her. That I'm so fantastically, over-the-top, wanna-slit-my-own-throat in love with her, that for every minute of every hour of every day I can't believe my own damn bad luck that you met her first!!

Joey: Well, that's pretty good. But you might wanna tone it down a little.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are there.]

Ross: (entering) Hey! So, uhh, Amanda just-just dropped me off. Yeah, that's one of the things I love about her, she's...uh, she's old enough to drive. (to Monica) So uhh, I guess you're not going to mom and dad's tonight?

Monica: No, sorry.

Rachel: Well where's Amanda?

Monica: Hey Rach, could you get me some cough drops?

Rachel: I mean y'know, I'm thinking. You could bring her, and you guys could go up to your old room, and not make out.

Monica: Ross, cough drops, please?

Ross: At least I know she's not going out with me to get into R rated movies.

Rachel: Why don't you just marry her? Oh no, wait a minute you can't, I'm sorry I forgot, she's not a lesbian.

Ross: You see Amanda and I have a very special...

Monica: (interrupting) You have nothing! You're not even going out! You're her baby sitter! You have a 12-year-old girl's job!

Rachel: (laughing) Ohh, that is soo sad.

Monica: And what are you laughing at, Miss `My-keg-sucking-boyfriend-is-stealing-from-me!'

(Ross starts laughing)

Rachel: Hey, so he stole a couple bucks from me! At least he bought me something with it! (Shows her, her ring)

Monica: That's mine!! Now, would you both please start acting like adults? And get me my cough drops!

Ross: Fine.

Rachel: Sorry.

Ross: Here. (Hands her, her cough drops) (to Rachel) At least I made ten bucks in my relationship.

Rachel: Y'know...

(She does Ross's little gesture. In response Ross puts his hands behind his neck with his arms sticking straight out and starts flapping them together.)

[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there with her guitar.]

Phoebe: (singing) Platting goats are platting. Platting down the street. Platting goats are platting, leaving little treats. (to Gunther) Does it even work without my sexy voice?

Gunther: I like it. (sneezes)

Phoebe: Gunther, kiss me.

Gunther: What?

(Phoebe grabs Gunther and kisses him. He then falls to the couch in shock.)

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching TV as Joey and Kathy are laughing in Joey's bedroom. They get to be pretty loud so Chandler turns the TV way up.]

Joey: (opening the door wearing nothing but a sock, and holding a dart board over the `Little General.') Hey! (Chandler turns down the TV) Now, we're not actually gonna be sleeping in her, but do you mind?

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, with a blanket draped over her shoulders, opens the door to a similarly clad Chandler.]

Chandler: Can I sleep on your couch?

(Monica nods `Yes.' And they both walk to the couch looking all depressed.)

Closing Credits

[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is singing, with everyone else present.]

Phoebe: (singing) And I'm still waiting for my paper mache man. Thank you my babies.

(applause)

Gunther: Rachel?

Rachel: Yeah.

Gunther: I don't know if you heard about what happened between me and Phoebe the other day_

Rachel: No!

Gunther: Well, we kissed. I-I-I didn't initiate the kiss, but-but I also didn't stop it, and I've been feeling guilty.

Rachel: (confused) Okay.

Gunther: So umm, are we cool?

Rachel: (really confused) Okay.

Gunther: I knew you'd understand.

(Gunther walks away, leaving Rachel with a `What just happened?' look on her face.)
[Scene: Central Perk, Ross and a beautiful blonde (Cheryl) are standing outside. The rest of the gang is watching from inside.]

Cheryl: So, thank you for the delicious dinner.

Ross: You're welcome for a delicious dinner.

[inside]

Phoebe: Hey what are you guys looking at?

Chandler: Ross and the most beautiful girl in the world.

Phoebe: Yeah, come to papa.

[Cheryl walks away and Ross walks inside. Everyone stares at him in disbelief.]

Ross: I know!

Monica: Probably the only time I'll ever say this, but did you see the ass on her?

Chandler: Where did you, when did you, how did you... (Joey hits the back of Chandler's head) How did you get a girl like that?

Rachel: Yeah, so what is she, like a... like a spokesmodel, or an aerobics instructor, what?

Ross: Actually she's a paleontology doctoral candidate, specializing in the centazoic era.

Chandler: Okay, but that's, like, the easiest era.

Ross: I've seen her at work, but I always figured, ah-huh? But, uh, I made her dinner. We had a great time. And we're going out again tomorrow.

Rachel: Well maybe she and her friends are just having a contest to see who can bring home the biggest geek.

Ross: Fine by me; hope she wins.

Opening Credits

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's. Ross, Rachel, and Phoebe are there. Chandler enters.]

Chandler: Hi. You guys have any wrapping paper?

Phoebe: Oo! Is it for my birthday present?

Chandler: Phebes, it was your birthday, like, months ago.

Phoebe: Yeah, but remember you said you ordered something special, and it just hasn't come yet?

Chandler: Well, I have a call in about that.

Phoebe: 'Kay.

Chandler: Actually, this is for Kathy's birthday. It's an early edition of her favorite book.

Rachel: Oh, The Velveteen Rabbit! Oh my God, when the boy's love makes the rabbit real!

Chandler: Okay, but don't touch it, because you fingers have destructive oils.

Rachel: Huh. Well, then you'd better keep it away from Ross's hair. So this is pretty rare. How did you get that?

Chandler: Oh, it wasn't a big deal. I just went to a couple of bookstores, talked to a couple of dealers... called a couple of the author's grandchildren.

Rachel: Oh, honey, that's so sweet.

Phoebe: Yeah, and what a great way to say, "I secretly love you, roommate's girlfriend!"

Chandler: It doesn't say that. Does it?

Ross: How do you think it's gonna look when you get her something incredibly meaningful and expensive and her boyfriend Joey gives her an orange?

Chandler: Okay, all right, I'll just uh, make sure that uh, Joey gets her something really great.

Phoebe: It's gotta be better than that book. Oo! Like a crossbow!

Monica: (Entering from her bedroom, talking on the phone) Yeah, once again, I am sorry. Thank you. Bye. (To the gang) I just had to turn down a job catering a funeral for sixty people.

Rachel: Oh my God! What happened?

Monica: Sixty guests.

Ross: So, uh, why did you have to turn it down?

Monica: Because I don't have the money or the equipment to handle something that big on such short notice. I mean there's no way.

Phoebe: Wow, what is with all the negativity? You sound like Monican't , not Monican... (Monica looks almost puzzled) ...Monica. Look, you know, you have been playing around with this catering thing for over three years. Do you want to be a caterer or not?

Monica: I don't know.

Phoebe: There you go, that's the spirit! Okay! Now, if you need money, I will lend you money, but just get moving!

Monica: Really? Cause I'd need like $500 for all the food and the supplies and stuff.

Phoebe: Okay! It's worth it, if it will get you moving. You haven't worked in months.

Monica: Well, you're not working either.

Phoebe: Yes, but I'm doing this.

Monica: Yeah, that'd be great! Thank you!

[Joey enters]

Joey: Hey!

Everyone: Hey.

Kathy: Can I borrow the keys to your apartment?

Joey: Why?

[Kathy whispers something in Joey's ear]

Joey: You can pee here!

Kathy: Ahahaha... haha.. yes I can, of course. Excuse me.

Chandler: It's okay, the duck's using our bathroom anyway. (Kathy goes into the bathroom.) Hey Joe! What are you getting Kathy for her birthday?

Joey: We've only been going out for a couple of weeks, do you think I gotta get her something?

Everyone: Yeah!

Rachel: Yes, you have to get her something, and it should be something really nice.

Joey: Oh, I know...

Rachel: And not one of your coupons for an hour of "Joey Love."

[cut to a new scene, also in Monica and Rachel's apartment. Rachel is sitting, Phoebe is nearby.]

Phoebe: Ooo, a crossword! Can I help?

Rachel: No! I'm sorry, honey, it's just that last week I got all but three answers and I really want to finish a whole one without any help.

Phoebe: Fine. But you can't help me develop my new universal language.

[Monica enters]

Monica: Hey!

Rachel: Hey, how'd it go?

Monica: Oh my God, it was the best funeral ever! I mean, everyone loved the food, and guess what? I even got another funeral for tomorrowâthe dead-guy-from-today's best friend. I mean, it is like I am the official caterer for that accident!

Phoebe: Mon! I'm so happy for you!

Monica: Thanks. Like, check out my new catering stuff. (Picks up two frying pans) Look at this! I'm an omelet station! Omelet? Made to order!

Phoebe: I'll have one, please. Plus my money.

Monica: Oh. Well, I didn't realize that you needed it back right away. I mean, you told me to go and be a caterer. So I went. I beed. I mean, I... I used it to buy all this stuff. But lookâI've got another job tomorrow, so I'll pay you back with the money I make from that.

Phoebe: Oh. Okay. Oo, sorry I acted like a bank.

Monica: Okay.

[Scene: Outside Cheryl's apartment, Ross and Cheryl are kissing]

Ross: (moved by the kiss) Huh...

Cheryl: Um, would you like to come in?

Ross: Did homo-erectus hunt with wooden tools?

Cheryl: According to recent findings!

[They go into the apartment. Inside the apartment it looks like a sewage dump exploded and landed in her living room. There are clothes and food and junk covering every square inch of space. I mean pigs have nicer pens. Ross is completely shocked.]

Cheryl: (throwing food around the room) Here Mitzi! Here Mitzi!

Ross: Mitzi is.....

Cheryl: My hamster. I hope she's okay, I haven't seen her in a while. Have a seat.

Ross: (mouths "where?") Uh... Oh hey, do you, uh (steps on some garbage and falters) ...do you have any, um, Cinnamon Fruit Toasties?

Cheryl: What?

Ross: Well, I do! Why don't we go back to my place, light a couple of candles, break open a box of Cinnamon Fruit Toasties, uh...

Cheryl: I'd rather not.

Ross: Oh, yeah, why not?

Cheryl: Okay, um, don't take this the wrong way, but your place kinda has a weird smell.

[Scene: A kitchen where Phoebe and Monica are finishing up a catering job]

Monica: Oh, is everything in the car?

Phoebe: Yes. Did you settle the bill?

Monica: No. I hate this part.

Phoebe: Oh, look what we almost left. (Picks up a coffee maker)

Monica: No, that's not mine.

Phoebe: Oh, all right. Oh! Look what we almost took!

[cut to the living room of the same dwelling, where the funeral guests are mingling. Monica enters.]

Monica: Excuse me, Mrs. Burkart? Well, we're all cleaned up in the kitchen.

Mrs. Burkart: Oh, good. Thank you.

Monica: Um, and, well there's the.. the the small matter of...

Mrs. Burkart: Dear?

Monica: Just the matter of ...payment?

Mrs. Burkart: (in grief) Jack used to handle the finances! (Breaks into tears)

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is on the couch still doing the crossword. Chandler is in the kitchen.]

Rachel: You know what we should all do? Go see a musical.

Chandler: (confused) Sure...

Rachel: And you know which one we should see? The 1996 Tony award winner. Do you happen to know the name of that one?

Chandler: I don't know... um, Grease?

Rachel: No....

Chandler: Rent?

Rachel: Yes! Rent!

Chandler: Okay, so when do you want to go?

Rachel: What? Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I'm busy.

Joey: (entering the apartment) Hey. Man, it is so hard to shop for girls.

Chandler: Yes, it is, at Office Max.

Rachel: What did you get her? (Joey opens up a rectangular black box and holds up a pen.)

Chandler: A pen.

Joey: It's two gifts in one. It's a pen that's also a clock! Huh?

Chandler: Huh-huh! You can't give her that.

Joey: Why not?

Chandler: Because she's not eleven! And it's not the seventh night of Hanukkah!

Rachel: Okay, honey, what he means by that, is ...while this is a very nice gift, maybe it's just not something a boyfriend gives?

Joey: Sure it is! She needs a pen for work, she's writing, she turns it over.... "Whoa! It's time for my date with Joey!"

Chandler: All right, look, look. What did... what did you get for Angela Delveccio for her birthday?

Joey: She didn't have a birthday while we were going out.

Chandler: For three years?

Joey: (whining and heading toward the door) Look, it's too late, and I got an audition. I can't shop anymore! I...

Chandler: All right. I will go out and I will try to find something for her, okay?

Joey: Thanks, man. And oh, while you're at it, could you get her a card?

Chandler: Would you like me to write her a little poem as well?

Joey: Or... just get a card that has a poem already in it.

[Scene: Back in the kitchen at the funeral. Phoebe is there, Monica enters.]

Phoebe: But Mon, you have to get our money!

Monica: Oh, Phoebe, she couldn't stop crying! With those thick glasses, her tears looked giant.

Phoebe: I know, it's tough. You know what the first thing I did after my mother's funeral was?

Monica: What?

Phoebe: Pay the caterer! Look, I've had a lot of jobs, okay, and there are some people who just always try to get out of paying. It's either, you know, "that massage wasn't long enough, or, "I don't recognize any of those songs," or, you know, "these sombreros aren't big enough. Bad little white girl!"

Monica: Okay. So what do you.... you think she's faking?

Phoebe: Well, it seems like there weren't any tears 'til you showed her the bill.

Monica: Phoebe, she sounded pretty upset to me.

[cut to the living room where Mrs. Burkart is now performing.]

Mrs. Burkart: (singing) You're a grand ol' flag, you're a high-flying flag, and forever in peace may you wave....

Phoebe: She seems fine now.

Mrs. Burkart: (singing) ...emblem of the land I love. The home of....

Commercial Break

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Joey are standing and talking, Ross is tying a tie.]

Joey: So, you just left? Her place was really that bad?

Ross: You know how you throw your jacket on a chair at the end of the day?

Joey: Yeah.

Ross: Well, like that, only instead of a chair, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of a jacket, it's a pile of garbage. And instead of the end of the day, it's the end of time, and garbage is all that has survived! (Ross takes the loosely tied tie off and hands it to Joey who puts it on.) Here.

Joey: Wow. Thanks. So, uh, what happened?

Ross: What do you mean? Nothing happened! I had to get out of there.

Joey: All right, so... next time, you take her to your place.

Ross: No, I tried that. She says it has a weird smell.

Joey: What kind of smell?

Ross: I don't know. Soap?

Joey: All right, listen, Ross... you like this girl, right?

Ross: Yeah.

Joey: You wanna see her again, right?

Ross: Yeah.

Joey: So you're gonna have to do it in the mess!

Ross: Yeah, okay you're right.

Joey: Yeah.

Ross: I mean, uh, who... who cares about a little sloppiness?

Joey: Yeah!

Ross: It's, uh... it's endearing, really.

Joey: All right! Now you go get that beautiful pig! (Ross hesitates, looks unsure) Oink!

[Scene: Monica and Rachel, Rachel is there, Chandler enters.]

Chandler: Okay, all right. I just spent the entire afternoon looking for a present for Kathy that would be better than the rabbit.

Rachel: Any luck?

Chandler: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I found this great place called "Invisible things for Kathy." (Motions to an imaginary pile of presents next to him.) Can you give me a hand with all this stuff?

Rachel: All right, look. Why don't you just return the book, let Joey give her the clock pen, and you give her something worse than that. Like... a regular pen.

Chandler: She's really going to love this, you know? The bottom line is I want her to have it, even if I don't get to be the one who gives it to her.

Rachel: Aw, honey, that's so sweet.

Chandler: Yeah? You don't think it's just pathetic?

Rachel: Oh! Pathetic! (Grabs the crossword puzzle and starts writing.)

Joey: (entering) Hey! I'm meeting Kathy in ten minutes! I've been looking all over for you!

Chandler: Where?

Joey: Our place, the hall! I...

Chandler: I got something for her. (Joey picks up the package, shakes it next to his ear, can't hear anything, switches ears, shakes it again.) It's a book!

Joey: (Unimpressed) A book? (Suddenly interested) Is it like a book that's also a safe?

Chandler: No, it's a book that's just a book, okay? It's an early edition of the Velveteen Rabbit. It was her favorite book as a kid. So, uh, just... let me know if she likes it, okay?

Joey: You got it. Thanks man. Thanks for doing this, I owe you one. (Joey leaves, comes back in.) Oh, hey! There wasn't any change from that twenty, was there?

Chandler: No, it came out to an even twenty.

Joey: Wow. That's almost as much as a new book.

[Scene: In the living room at the funeral]

Mrs. Burkart: (singing) Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those peepers? Jeepers, creepers, where'd you get those eyes?

[cut to Monica and Phoebe in the kitchen]

Phoebe: You didn't get the money, did you?

Monica: Maybe I can try at intermission? Phoebe, come on... you know what? Let's just go!

Phoebe: No! Hey, we're not leaving until we get paid! I don't know who she thinks she is! Enough is enough! (Phoebe goes into the living room.) Hey, widow?

Mrs. Burkart: (Singing) Come on along and listen to...

Phoebe: Okay, Widow!

Mrs. Burkart: (Singing) ...the lullabye of...

Phoebe: Excuse me. Excuse me! (Mrs. Bukart stops singing) Thanks. Um, clearly this is a very, very hard time for you. Um, but, um, we provided a service, and we deserve to be paid because you ate that service, and, um, we are not leaving here until we're paid every penny. 'Cause you know what, lady? We're part time caterers, and we have no place else to go.

Mrs. Burkart: All right. I'll get my bag.

Phoebe: Good. (Phoebe and Mrs. Burkart go into the other room, leaving Monica with everyone staring at her.)

Monica: I'm gonna leave some cards here. Please think of us for you next event.

[Scene: Outside Cheryl's apartment.]

Cheryl: So you want to come inside?

Ross: (mustering up courage) Yes. Yes I do. (They go inside.)

Cheryl: I'll be right back. Make yourself comfortable. (Ross attempts to clear a place for his coat and fold it small enough to fit. Then hit sits on the couch. Something falls on him from above and he brushes his neck off frantically.)

Cheryl: (sneaking up behind Ross) Guess who?

Ross: Department of Sanitation?

Cheryl: It's me!

Ross: Oh! (She kisses him) Ah. (They kiss more, and move down onto the couch. Ross's hand moves under some garbage) Aw! (His hand is covered with something brown and gooey.)

Cheryl: What?

Ross: (trying to make his disgust into lust) Ah, Cheryl!

Cheryl: Oh, Ross!

[They sit up, moaning in excitement, and Cheryl straddles Ross. Ross finds a slice of bologna and moans higher and louder, then a bag of potato chips on the coffee table starts to move. Ross throws Cheryl off his lap, grabs a tennis racket and a toilet brush and starts pounding the bag.]

Cheryl: Wait! No! No! It's my hamster! It's Mitzi!

Ross: Oh my god! I'm so sorry, Cheryl. I must have freaked out.

Cheryl: (looking in the bag) Oh, thank god, it's not Mitzi. It's just a rat.

[Scene: Central Perk. Rachel is sitting on the couch alone working on a crossword puzzle. Gunther is there, going into the back room.]

Rachel: I did it! Oh! I finished it! I did it all by myself! And there's nobody to hug!

[From the background we hear a crash and Gunther comes running out of the back room, pushing people aside, reaching for Rachel.]

Gunther: Move!

[Gunther slips and falls just before reaching the back of the couch. Monica and Phoebe come into Central Perk.]

Rachel: Hey! Hey, you guys, I finished the crossword all by myself! Hug me!

[Gunther gets up slowly from behind the couch and walks away sadly]

Phoebe: Uh... yay!

Rachel: Thanks!

Monica: Oh, that's great! Congratulations!

Rachel: Thank you! Hey, how'd the catering go?

Monica: Oh, it was great! The widow wouldn't pay, so Phoebe yelled at her 'til she did.

Phoebe: Yeah. I'm a hard ass.

Monica: And I'm a wuss. And we should be partners.

Phoebe: Yeah. Hard Ass and Wuss. We could fight crime!

Monica: Wait a minute, Phoebe! We should be partners. We should be catering partners. I mean, think about it! You're not working right now, and we have such a great time together!

Phoebe: Okay!

Monica: I can cook and you can take care of the money.

Phoebe: Yeah. Oh! It'll be like I have a wife in the fifties!

Both: (screaming with excitement) Aah!

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is there, Joey enters.]

Chandler: Hey, how'd it go? How'd she like the gift?

Joey: Oh, man, she loved it! She's over there showing Monica and Rachel right now.

Chandler: Oh yeah? That's great!

Joey: Hey, listen, I gotta tell ya, I feel kinda bad taking credit for this, because man, am I gonna get a lot of credit for this!

Chandler: [nodding, with mixed feelings] Aahhuuhhh....

[Kathy enters]

Kathy: Hey.

Joey: Hey!

Chandler: No he didn't. [Moving it back.]

Joey: Yeah, he did, look... look, it's right there on the counter! Ha-ho-ho!

Chandler: Happy birthday! I'm sorry.

Kathy: You really didn't have to. (Opens the box) Wow.

Chandler: See, you think it's just a pen, but then you turn it over and it's also a clock.

Kathy: Yeah. No, this is great. Thank you, Chandler. (They hug).

Chandler: Oh, yeah... yeah.

Joey: Ah. Hm. (To Kathy) Wanna go to bed?

Kathy: I'll be in in a minute.

Joey: Oh, uh... don't forget your coupon. (Tries to strike a sexy pose up against the doorway to his room. Then goes inside).

Chandler: [to Kathy] Goodnight.

Kathy: Um, thank you for the gift.

Chandler: Oh, uh, yeah... I just knew that sometimes when you're writing, you... you don't always know the exact time.

Kathy: No, I... I didn't mean the pen. Thank you for the book.

Chandler: Uh, the book?

Kathy: The Velveteen Rabbit. I kinda have the feeling you had something to do with it.

Chandler: What do you mean?

Kathy: Well, uh, when Joey gave it to me, he said, "This is 'cause I know ya like Rabbits, and I know ya like cheese." Thanks. I love it. And I know how hard it must have been for you to find.

Chandler: (tongue-tied) Uhl..ell. By the way, in case you missed that, that sound was, "Uhl, ell."

Kathy: You must really like... Joey... to go to all that trouble for him.

Chandler: Oh, yeah, he's my... he's my best friend.

Kathy: Well....

Chandler: Goodnight. (Goes to his room.)

Joey: (opening bedroom door) Hey, that coupon expires, you know.

[Scene: Outside Cheryl's apartment, Monica knocks on Cheryl's door]

Monica: Hi. Uh, you... you don't know me, I'm Monica Geller... Ross's sister.

Cheryl: Oh, yeah. Oh, you know, that's too bad that didn't work out.

Monica: Yeah. Anyway, he told me about your apartment. And, um, I couldn't sleep, thinking about it. So, uh, would it be okay if I cleaned it?

[Cheryl shrugs, shuts the door, looking puzzled]

Monica: No?

[Monica looks around the hallway, pulls out a sponge and starts scrubbing the door frame.]
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, everyone except Joey and Chandler are there eating breakfast.]

Chandler: (entering in a bathrobe) I just walked in the bathroom and saw Kathy naked! It was like torture!

Ross: Y'know if we ever go to war and youâre captured, youâre in for a big surprise.

Chandler: It just keeps getting worse and worse! Y'know? I mean itâs bad enough that Iâm in love with my roommates girlfriendâwhich by the way, I think she knows. Because every time weâre in the room together thereâs this weird like energy between us. And call me crazy, but I think she likes me too. And now I have seen her naked. I mean at least when Iâve seen her with clothes on, I could imagine her body was like covered in boles or something. But there are no boles, sheâs smooth! Smooth! (leaves)

(Pause)

Phoebe: Wow! Could everyone totally see up his robe?

All: Yeah! Oh my God!

Opening Credits

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is getting a phone number from a woman (Casey) as Chandler watches from the doorway.]

Casey: Here you go.

Joey: Great! All right, so Iâll call you later.

Casey: Great! (leaves)

Chandler: (rushing up) Hey-Hey-Hey! Who was that?

Joey: That would be Casey. Weâre going out tonight.

Chandler: Goinâ out, huh? Wow! Wow! (Does a little celebration dance) So things didnât work out with Kathy, huh? Bummer.

Joey: No, things are fine with Kathy. Iâm having a late dinner with her tonight, right after my early dinner with Casey.

Chandler: (shocked) What?

Joey: Yeah-yeah. And the craziest thing is that I just ate a whole pizza by myself! (Laughs)

Chandler: Wait! Youâre going out with Kathy!

Joey: Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?

Chandler: Well, Iâm upsetâfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you. (He canât believe he just sad that.)

Joey: What is the big deal? Itâs not like weâre exclusive.

Chandler: Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs. But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that sheâs-sheâs smart, and funny, and gets you.

Joey: You got all that from the back of her head?

Chandler: All right look, I think itâs time for you to settle down. Y'know? Make a choice, pick a lane.

Joey: Whoâs Elaine?

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross and Monica are sitting on the couch playing cards, and Phoebe is working on a new song.]

Phoebe: (singing) "Little, tiny Tarzan, swinging on a nose hair. Swinging with the greatest of easeâ¦" Darn it! Now, I donât know who to get to the next verse.

Ross: Oh, you could just go uh, "greatest of easeâ¦ (plays air guitar) BAH-bah-bha-bhannn." Then go right into it.

Phoebe: Yeah, ooh, I like that! Yeah. Wait! How do you know about âbah-bah-bha-bhan?â

Ross: Well umm, yâknow, I used to play.

Phoebe: Oh yeah, thatâs right, the keyboards, huh?

Ross: Yeah, just a little in high school, but then I really got into it in college. I mean thatâs-thatâs when I really found my sound.

(Monica is taking a drink as Ross says that, laughs, and snorts her drink.)

Monica: Oh God! Orange juice just came out of my nose, but it was totally worth it. Oh my God, I completely forgot about your sound.

Ross: Yeah.

Monica: He used to lock himself in the basement for hours. No one was every allowed to hear, "The Sound."

Phoebe: I wanna hear "The Sound."

Ross: Really? No. I mean, nah, I havenât played in so long, and-and, well itâs-itâs really personal stuff, yâknow?

Phoebe: Come on, play that funky music white boy.

Monica: Yeah!

Ross: No, you guys, I mean my keyboards are all the way up inâNo, yeah, okay. (Runs out.)

[Cut to later that same day, Ross has retrieved his keyboard and is about to debut, "The Sound."]

Ross: Okay, guys.

Chandler: All right! Bring it on, youâ¦

Ross: Here we go. (Plays one note) Yâknow, Iâve-Iâve never played my stuff for anyone before, so itâs important that-that you understand itâs about communicating very private emotions. (Plays another note) Yâknow, umm, you should-you should think of umm, my work as wordless sound poems. Thatâs what Iâmâ¦

Chandler: (interrupting) Oh my God! Play!

(Ross starts to play. He plays a key that has a back beat sound attached to it. Over the background music he plays the sound of a barking dog, a mooing cow, a laser beam, someone coughing, a jackhammer, a doorbell, a police siren, a ray gun, breaking dishes, and for a closer he plays the sound of a loud crash. Basically, the music sucks.)

Monica: (At a loss for words) Boy, that was-that was, ummâ¦ terrific.

Chandler: Really, bitchinâ!

Phoebe: Wow, it was soâwow!

Ross: Really?! I mean, really?!!

Rachel: Yeah, I mean, you should play in public!

Ross: Wow! Thanks, you guys. Thatâs uhâohhh, I wanna, I wanna play you another piece! Umm! Uh-oh! I left my uh, helicopter sounds on another disk. Iâll be right back! Okay? (Runs to fetch them) This is so nice, IâmâI am soâ¦ (starts to break up and leaves)

Monica: Oh God bless my dad sound proofing the basement!

Rachel: Oh, I canât believe I ever let him touch me with those fingers.

Phoebe: What are you guys talking about, I loved it! It was soo moving. Oh, plus itâs just, itâs so different from the stuff you usually hear.

Chandler: You mean like, music?

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching Yasmein Bleeth running on TV, and the duck starts quacking.]

Chandler: Yeah, I know what youâre thinkinâ! Yes, yes, your breasts are just as firm and juicy.

(Thereâs a knock on the door.)

Chandler: Come in!

Kathy: (entering) Hey! (sees whatâs on TV) Oh God, is that Baywatch?

Chandler: Uh yes, but uh, I just watch it for the articles.

Kathy: So is Joey around?

Chandler: No-no, heâs not back yet, but heâll be here any minute. So uh, come on in. Have a seat. Bow or stern?

Kathy: I uh, donât really have a preference. You?

Chandler: I like it in the stern. (Realizes what he just said.) â¦of the boat. (The phone rings, and he answers it.) (on phone) Hello.

Joey: (on the other end at a pay phone) Hey, itâs me. Listen Casey and I were on our way back and had a little car trouble.

Chandler: What happened?

Joey: We broke down on the Parkway, so I have to walk back and get some transmission fluid. And hey, listen could you please tell Kathy that Iâll be there as soon as I can.

Chandler: Why canât you tell her?

Joey: âCause I only have one quarter, and I think my time is about toâ(he stops talking suddenly)

Chandler: Joey! Joey!!

Joey: Yeah?

Chandler: I thought your time ran out.

Joey: Me too, but I guess I do have a couple of moreâ(his time runs out for real)

Chandler: (to Kathy) Uhh, that was Joey. Heâs running a little late, he says heâs sorry.

Kathy: Oh.

Chandler: So I guess itâs just uh, you and me then.

Kathy: Oh, okay.

Chandler: Yeah, I think it is!

Kathy: So what did you do today?

Chandler: Oh, I had an appointment to get my haircutâ¦

Kathy: (interrupting) Oh, it looks great!

Chandler: â¦and then it got canceled.

Kathy: Well, I could cut it.

Chandler: Really?! You do that?

Kathy: Yeah, I do. Of course, I learned at my auntâs dog grooming shop, but hey, what do you say?

Chandler: Dog grooming huh? Okay, just donât make my tail too poofy.

[Cut to later, Kathy is cutting Chandlerâs hair.]

Kathy: You have really great hair.

Chandler: Well, thanks. I grow it myself. (Kathy is running her fingers through his hair, and Chandler catches himself enjoying it too much.) Yâknow who also has great hair is Joey!

Kathy: Yes! Yeah! Joey has great hair! Umm, Iâm basically done here. Just let me get this off your neck.

(Kathy leans in really close and Chandler mouths "Oh my God." She moves around in front of him and kneels at his feet.)

Chandler: What-what âcha doinâ?

Kathy: Checking to see if itâs even.

Chandler: âKay.

Kathy: Looks good.

(They lean in to kiss and are interrupted by the phone.)

Chandler: (jumping up to answer the phone) Oh the phone! The phoneâs making sounds! (On phone) Hello!

Joey: (on phone) Hey dude, itâs me.

Chandler: Hey itâs Joey!

Joey: Listen uh, Iâm really sorry, it looks like Iâm gonna be stuck here for a while. I got the transmission fluid, but when I went to put it in the car, the transmission wasnât there!

Chandler: What?

Joey: Yeah, it mustâve fallen out a few blocks back. I just figured we hit a dog.

Chandler: Okay.

Joey: Listen uh, could you put Kathy on, I wanna apologize.

Chandler: Oh yeah man. (to Kathy) Joey. (Hands her the phone.)

Kathy: (on phone) Hey. (listens) Oh no itâs fine, donât worry about it. (listens) Yeah-no, stop apologizing, itâs okay. (listens) Yeah! Iâll talk to you tomorrow. (hangs up) (to Chandler) I should uh, probably go.

Chandler: Yeah. Yes! Yeah.

(Kathy leaves and Chandler groans in agony. Kathy knocks on the door and Chandler opens it.)

Kathy: I forgot my purse.

Chandler: Oh.

(They kiss, passionately.)

Kathy: No, I really did forget my purse.

(They kiss again.)

Kathy: Horrible!

Chandler: Wait the uh, the kiss or the situation?

Kathy: No-no-no, the kiss was good.

Chandler: Okay!

Kathy: No, but thatâs bad!

Chandler: Ooh! Yes! Okay! Hereâs what we do, we-we forget it happened.

Kathy: What?!

Chandler: Okay, we-we swallow our feelings. Even if it means weâre unhappy forever. Sound good?

Kathy: Can you really do that?

Chandler: I have to; heâs my best friend, and youâre seeing him.

Kathy: Chandler, I like Joey a lot, but with youâ¦

Chandler: (interrupting) Oh-no-no-no! Donât! Donât! See-see, youâre getting me confused, Iâm starting to urn.

Kathy: Iâm sorry. If you wanna pretend that nothing happened, I can try.

Chandler: I-I think we have too.

Kathy: Okay. Bye.

Chandler: Bye. (Kathy leaves and Chandler wonders over to and leans up against the door.) Are you still out there?

Kathy: (outside the door) No. (Chandler opens the door and they kiss again.)

[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is performing, his music hasnât improved.]

Monica: (to Rachel and Phoebe) Y'know, thereâs a Starbucks about three blocks down.

Phoebe: (pushing Monica back onto the couch) Itâs so inspired! Look at him! Look at him go!

Ross: (with the altered voice) Thank you guys-guys-guysâ¦

Monica: (to Phoebe) Hey, arenât you up next?

Phoebe: Oh no, Iâm not playing tonight.

Rachel: Why not?

Phoebe: I canât follow Ross! Itâd be like those bicycle ridding chimps that followed The Beetles. No.

Monica: Phoebe, Ross sucks!

Rachel: Phoebe, the place has emptied because of him.

Phoebe: Oh my God, heâs not even appreciated in his own time. I would give anything to not be appreciated in my own time!

(Rachel and Monica look at each other, and agree on something without saying anything.)

Monica: Okay. Umm, Phoebe, you suck too.

Rachel: Yeah, Phoebe youâreâ¦ awful!

Phoebe: You guys. You suck too. (She hugs them both.)

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is opening the door, but Chandler has the chain on it.]

Joey: Aww man! I canât believe I locked myself out again! (He knocks on the door.)

Chandler: Hang on buddy! (He goes over and unlocks the door and opens it to reveal a fully furnished apartment.)

Joey: (rushing in) Oh my God! What happened here? Did you do all this?

Chandler: I sure did.

Joey: Why?

Chandler: Well, I just thought itâd make me feel good to do something nice for my friend.

Joey: Well, youâre amazing.

Chandler: Oh no-no-no. This is amazing. (He goes over and presses a button on a remote control that opens the entertainment center doors revealing the TV.)

Joey: (very excited) A TV as if it appears from nowhere! Thatâs the dream! Man, how did you afford this stuff?

Chandler: Well, yâknow Iâm 29. I mean who needs a savings account.

Joey: Oh, you are the best friends anyone has ever had.

Chandler: Oh, I donât know.

Joey: Oh-no-no-no, you are! You do this, you give me the great advice, and hey listen, I was thinking about what you said yesterday about focusing on one woman, Iâm gonna do that.

Chandler: You mean with Casey.

Joey: No-no-no, I think Iâm gonna see how things go with Kathy. Sheâs pretty cool.

Chandler: Or Casey.

Joey: No-no, Kathy.

Chandler: Could be Casey.

Joey: No. No, Kathy.

Chandler: Consider Casey.

Joey: Yâknow what I think? I think somebodyâs got a little crush on Casey. How âbout I fix you two up? What do you think?

Chandler: That all the pieces of my life are falling right into place!

[Scene: Central Perk, Ross has just finished playing.]

Ross: (to Phoebe) Hey!

Phoebe: Hey! You were really great! You were really, really great!

Ross: Oh, thanks, thanks. So Monica tells me that uh, you donât want to play anymore because me and y'know my talent. Is that true?

Phoebe: Well, kinda. Yeah. Yeah.

Ross: Pheebsâ¦

Phoebe: Yeah, I-I canâtâI mean yâknow I was trying to be really y'know okay and upbeat about it, I justâI feel so dwarfed by your musical gift. Iâ¦

Ross: See but, Pheebs that-that is the exact opposite intent of my music. Yâknow my music is-is meant to inspire, and if it bothers you this much, then Iâ¦ I wonât play anymore.

Phoebe: Oh no. No-no-no, donât do that! How could I live with myself if I knew I was depriving the world of your music.

Ross: Yeah, okay.

[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel and Monica are sitting on the couch and Phoebe is getting coffee as Chandler enters. Ross is also there.]

Ross: Hey Chandler! Saw the new furniture. Very nice.

Monica: Yeah! Joey has the best boyfriend ever!

Chandler: I kissed Kathy.

Ross: What?

Monica: Are you serious?

Phoebe: Does Joey know?

Chandler: No. Is there anyway, anyway you think heâll understand this?

Monica: You obviously havenât screwed over a lot of your friends. (They all look at her) Which we all appreciate.

Ross: No the-the sad thing is, if you had told him how you felt before you kissed her, knowing Joey, he probably just wouldâve just stepped aside.

Chandler: Oh, donât say that! Donât say that. Thatâs not true. Is it?

Phoebe: I think maybe, yeah.

Monica: He loves you.

Chandler: Then why didnât you tell me to do that?!!

Ross: Well, I said-I said something to Phoebe.

Phoebe: Yeah! No, thatâs right. And I thought it was a really good idea.

Rachel: I know, I remember that!

Monica: I remember you did.

Chandler: God!! (Sits down in disgust.) What am I gonna do?!

Rachel: Well, Chandler, youâre gonna have to tell him.

Chandler: Why?! Why do I have to tell him?!

Rachel: Because you do.

Chandler: Yeah, I know.

Ross: Hey, would it be okay if I wrote a song about this.

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is watching TV as Chandler enters.]

Chandler: Hey!

Joey: Hey! Samboucha Margarita?

Chandler: Is that a real thing?

Joey: Well, we only had samboucha, so it is now.

Chandler: Listen ah, Joe, I-I need to, I need to talk to you about something.

Joey: Whatâs up?

Chandler: Itâs-itâs about Kathy. Umm, uh, I like her. I like her a lot actually.

Joey: You do?

Chandler: Yeah.

Joey: Well, youâre timing couldnât be better. Sheâs not my girlfriend anymore.

Chandler: What?

Joey: Yeah, she broke up with me.

Chandler: Oh uh, when?

Joey: Just now, after acting class. At first I thought she was doing some kind of scene, thatâs why I let people watch.

Chandler: Oh man, I am so sorry. Are, are you okay?

Joey: Well, Iâve been better. But, Iâm all right. So you like her huh?

Chandler: Yes, but I-I uh, donât have too.

Joey: No-no-no, no itâs uh, itâs okay.

Chandler: Yeah?

Joey: Yeah. You know why? âCause you came to me first.

Chandler: Well, I thought that would be the best thing to do.

Joey: But hey, listen just so you know, you might have youâre work cut out for you. âCause when I talked to her, I kinda got the feeling that sheâs into some other guy. Soâ¦

Chandler: See uh, thatâs-thatâs actually what I wanted to talk to you about. I-I think I know who the other guy is.

Joey: Who?

Chandler: Itâs me. Iâm the other guy.

Joey: What?

Chandler: Yeah, I mean when you were late last night, Kathy and I got to talking, and one thing to another andâ¦

Joey: And what?! Did you sleep with her?!

Chandler: No! No! No! I just kissed her.

Joey: What?!! Thatâs even worse!!

Chandler: How is that worse?!

Joey: I donât know! But itâs the same!

Chandler: Look, Iâm sorry! But thereâs nothing I can do, I think Iâm in love with her!

Joey: Who cares?! You went behind my back! I would never do that to you!

Chandler: Youâre right, I have no excuses! I was totally over the line.

Joey: Over the line?! You-youâre-youâre so far past the line, that you-you canât even see the line! The line is a dot to you!

Chandler: Yes. Yes! Right! And I feel horrible. You have to believe me!

Joey: Is that why you bought all this stuff?! (Chandler makes a face like "Well, kinda.") Well, yâknow what I will not watch your TV, I will not listen to your stereo, and thereâs a cinnamon raisin loaf in the new bread maker that Iâm not gonna eat! You know why?!

Chandler: Probably becauseâ¦

Joey: Because itâs all tainted with your betrayal. From now on this apartment is empty for me! And Iâm not happy about you either. (The bread maker dings) Oh, and just so you know, I made that bread for you. (Joey walks into his bedroom and slams the door.)

Chandler: (entering) Aww, turkey! Aww, giving thanks! Aww!

Phoebe: Look everyone, itâs the spirit of Thanksgiving!

Rachel: So are things with you and Joey any better?

Chandler: They couldnât be worse. I spent eight hours calling him last night, just trying to get him to talk to me.

Rachel: Oh wow, eight hours? So you could probably really use one of those plug-in telephone headsets huh?

Ross: Should we all expect Christmas gifts that can be stolen from your office?

Rachel: You shouldnât.

Phoebe: Speaking of Christmas, umm since Monica and I are starting a new business and have like no money, umm, this year maybe we could do secret Santa, and then we each only buy one gift. And-and thereâs the added mystery of who gets who.

Ross: Who gets whom. (They all look at him.) I donât know why I do that.

[Cut to later, the gang, minus Joey, is watching the Thanksgiving Day parade.]

Rachel: Well, Iâm gonna take a nap, turkey makes me sleepy.

Chandler: Hey, by any chance did either of pick uh Rachel for your secret Santa, âcause I wanna trade for her.

Phoebe: I picked her! Oh thank God you want her! Ooh!

Chandler: Wow! Why do you want to get rid of her so badly?

Phoebe: Because she exchanges every gift she ever gets, itâs like impossible to get her something she likes. Come on, letâs trade!

Chandler: Oh thatâs not true! Thatâs not true! I got her that backpack and she loved it! I remember how much she was crying the day when that big dog ran off with itâ¦ (notices the look on Monica and Phoebeâs faces.) Oh, there was no big dog. All right this sucks! I already got her this briefcase, and I had R.G. put on itâ¦ (Phoebe looks confused.) Her initialsâ¦

Phoebe: Ohh.

Monica: Well, maybe you could give to somebody else. Ooh, like Ross Geller.

Chandler: Op, y'know what though, itâs kindâve a girlie briefcase.

Monica: Who cares? He works in a museum!

Chandler: Hey, what time is it? The big game is about to start!

Phoebe: You donât have to do that, Ross and Joey arenât here, you can watch the parade if you want.

Chandler: Thanks.

Monica: What is wrong with this freezer?! (She jabs her arm into the freezer and a piece of ice flies into her eye.) Ow! Ow!!

Phoebe: God, what happened?!

Monica: Oh my God, ice just got in my eye!

Rachel: (standing in her doorway) People are trying to sleep in here!

Chandler: Monica got ice in her eye, and it hurts.

Phoebe: Open it up, let me see.

Monica: Oh, yâknow what, I canât, it really kills.

Chandler: Well maybe you should put some ice on it.

Phoebe: Ooh, God it looks bad.

Rachel: Honey, maybe we should take you to a doctor.

Monica: No, my eye doctor is Richard! I canât go to him when I donât have a boyfriend!

Chandler: Heâs really picky about his patients.

Phoebe: Honey, youâve got to go. Whatâs his office number?

Monica: Like I remember his office number! (Pause) Speed dial 7.

Phoebe: (on phone) Hi! Yeah, Iâm calling on behalf of Monica Gellerâs eye, and is um, is Richard Burke in today. (Listens) (to Monica) Heâs out of town, but does she want to see the on-call doctor?

Monica: Yes!!

Phoebe: Yes! Sheâs very excited about that.

[Cut to later, Phoebe is adding butter to something and Ross is watching.]

Phoebe: This is so cool, âtil Monica gets back, itâs like Iâm head chef and I get to make all the decisions. (She looks at the remaining butter, and then decides to add it to the dish.)

Ross: Hey-hey, I thought she told you to follow the recipe exactly!

Phoebe: Okay, get out of my kitchen!

Chandler: (entering) All right! Okay! I think I am making some progress with Joey, when I went into the apartment he went straight into his bedroom but he only slammed the door once! (Ross is pleased.) I mean yeah, he gave me the finger while doing it.

Phoebe: All right Iâ¦ I gotta call my mom and ask her a left handed cooking question.

Ross: So listen ah, I picked Monica for secret Santa, but Iâm already getting her something for Chanukah, I was wondering if you wanna switch.

Chandler: Oh yâknow what, I was already trying to trade for ah, well, you.

Ross: Really?! Wow! Thatâs-thatâs so nice, what are you gonna get me?

Chandler: I donât know R.G., I was thinking something girlie for your office.

Ross: Yeah, well maybe Phoebe will switch with me.

Chandler: Oh no-no-no, you donât want to do that, then youâre gonna get stuck with Rachel and she exchanges every gift she ever gets.

Ross: Oh, thatâs not true! Iâve got her lots of stuff she never took back.

Chandler: Like?

Ross: Like uh, that gold necklace I got her last year.

Chandler: When was the last time you saw her wear it?

Ross: Well, she wore it all Christmas day, and then uhâ¦

Chandler: Big dog?

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is repacking the furniture into boxes to return it.]

Ross: (entering) Hey!

Joey: Hey!

Ross: What are you doing?

Joey: Iâm sending back all this stuff that Chandler bought out of guilt.

Ross: Everything? Even the TV?

Joey: No! Iâm putting that in my room.

Ross: Listen, Joey, I know what he did was wrong but donât you think you could at least hear the guy out?

Joey: Back when you and Rachel were together, if Chandler had kissed her, would you hear him out?

Ross: Thatâs a good point. So uh, how long are you gonna punish him?

Joey: Five years.

Ross: Youâve sentenced him?!

Joey: Hey! Donât do the crime if you canât do the time.

Ross: Joey, the guyâs your best friend.

Joey: No, was my best friend. Anyway, I donât know why youâre pushing for him so hard. With him out of the way as my best friend, thereâs a spot open.

Ross: Oh, who? Me?

Joey: Yeah!

Ross: Wow! Iâm honored! And yâknow what Iâm gonna do as my first act as your best friend?

Joey: What?

Ross: Iâm gonna get you to talk to Chandler.

Joey: All right. But if you werenât my best friend.

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Kathy are sitting at a table and talking about Joey.]

Kathy: Oh my God, is it really that bad?

Chandler: I walk into a room and he wonât even talk to me, he just mumbles something in Italian. And I know he only knows the bad words.

Joey: (entering) Hey Gunther, have you uh, have you seen Chandler?

Gunther: I thought you were Chandler. But umm, one of who is over there.

(Joey turns around and sees them kissing.)

Kathy: Oh.

Chandler: Hey Joe.

Joey: (Something in Italian.) (Storms out.)

[Scene: Dr. Burkeâs office, Rachel and Monica are waiting as the doctor arrives.]

Doctor: Iâll be right with you. Okay? (to the nurse) Thanks, Wendy.

Monica: Oh my God! How cute is the on-call doctor?

Rachel: Ooh, so cute, that Iâm thinking about jamming this pen in my eye.

(The intercom buzzes.)

Nurse: Dr. Burke will see you know.

Monica: Oh no-no-no, not Dr. Burke. Dr. Burke is out of town. The-the on-call doctor will see me now.

Nurse: Dr. Richard Burke is out of town. Dr. Timothy Burke, his son, will see you now.

Dr. Timothy Burke: Ready?

(Monica looks at Rachel, who gives her the thumbs up.)

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is packing as Chandler rushes in.]

Chandler: Hey! Iâm sorry! Thatâ(sees that Joey is about to leave) where are you going?

Joey: My folks.

Chandler: Oh, uh, when-when are you coming back?

Joey: I donât know. I might stay there for a few days while I look for an apartment.

Chandler: What?!

Joey: Yeah, yâknow at first I thought we could talk about this yâknow, work it out, but uh, seeing you two together I donât think Iâ¦

Chandler: Hey, look, what do you want me to say? Do you want me to say that Iâll stop seeing her?

Joey: Look, itâs not about her. Okay? But seeing you two together just reminds me of what you did. And I donât want to live with some one who doesnât know what it is to be a friend. So, Iâll see ya. (He starts to leave, but Chandler grabs his bag and stops him.)

Chandler: Hey, look, I know what it is to be a friend, I just-I just screwed up!

Joey: Yeah! You did! And thatâs why Iâm leaving.

(The chick and the duck walk into the living room.)

Chandler: All right look, if youâre not gonna stay for me, then at least stay for them! Okay, they have had a very difficult year! What with the robbery and all!

Joey: When that guy was robbing us, and I was locked in the entertainment unit for like six hours, you know what I was doing in there all that time? I was thinking about how I let you down!

Chandler: What?

Joey: Yeah! But if wouldâve know what kind of friend you were gonna turn out to be, I wouldnât have worried about it so much! See you around!

Chandler: All right, wait! Come on! Just wait one second! There has to be something that I can do! Something! If we still had that entertainment unit I would get in it for six hours and think about how I let you down. (Joey looks intrigued) What?

Joey: Weâve got a box. (Motions to a large wooden box next to him.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: Dr. Burkeâs office, Tim is examining Monica.]

Tim: Last time I saw you, it was the morning I left for college. And you were just standing outside The Dairy Queen.

Monica: I was probably waiting for it to open.

Tim: I gotta tell you, you look great now.

Monica: You look great too.

Tim: Youâre an excellent patient!

Monica: So how does it look?

Tim: Well, youâve got a little scratch on your cornea, your gonna have to wear a patch for a couple of days.

Monica: Like a pirate?!

Tim: If that helps you.

Monica: Umm, so how long have you been working with your dad? (He looks at her) Come on, one of us had to mention him.

Tim: I moved back here a couple of months ago.

Monica: Oh. Big family dinner tonight?

Tim: Uh. (He holds up a brown lunch bag.)

Monica: No way!

Tim: I was gonna have Thanksgiving at my girlfriendâs.

Monica: (disappointed) Oh.

Tim: But we broke up.

Monica: (happy) Oh.

Tim: She-she wasnât ready for a serious commitment.

Monica: (sympathetic) Oh. (in a pirateâs voice) So you made her walk the plank? Aye, matie?

Tim: Youâre not wearing the patch yet.

Monica: I know.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Itâs closer to dinner. Monica has just told everyone that Tim is coming to dinner.]

Ross: Heâs coming here for Thanksgiving!

Rachel: I know, itâs sick.

Monica: Why is it sick?

Rachel: Because itâs Richardâs son! Itâs like inviting Greek tragedy over for dinner!

Monica: Hey, come on, Phoebe, you understand donât you?

Phoebe: Yeah, I can see where Iâd be your best shot but, no. Iâm sorry, but I think itâs twisted.

Ross: Yeah.

Joey: (coming out of the bathroom) Whatâs twisted?

Monica: Me going out with Richardâs son.

Joey: Ewwwww!! Ew! Ew! Ew!

Chandler: (He is now in the box, in their living room.) Sounds like a really bad idea to me.

Rachel: Is he okay in there?

Joey: Heâs fine!

Ross: Hey, y'know, Mon, if things wrong out between you and Richardâs son, youâd be able to tell your kids, that you slept with their grandfather.

Monica: Fine! Judge all you want to but, (points to Ross) married a lesbian, (points to Rachel) left a man at the altar, (points to Phoebe) fell in love with a gay ice dancer, (points to Joey) threw a girlâs wooden leg in a fire, (points to Chandler) livinâ in a box!! (goes to her room)

Rachel: So now, what exactly is the point of the box?

Joey: Chandler?

Chandler: The meaning of the box is three fold. One (holds a finger up through the air hole), it gives me the time to think about what I did. Two (holds up another finger), it proves how much I care about my friendship with Joey. And three (holds up a third finger), it hurts!

Ross: (to Rachel) Oh hey! Hey uh, you remember the necklace I gave you last year? Can I see it?

Rachel: (worried) Why?

Ross: I just wanna check something.

Rachel: Okay. (She goes into her bedroom)

Ross: (He puts his hand over the hole on the box.) (to Chandler) Now, weâll see.

Chandler: Air hole! Air hole!! (Ross retracts his hand quickly.)

Rachel: (coming out of her bedroom with a necklace) Here it is! I love it. I wear it all the time.

Ross: (grabbing the necklace) The necklace I got you was gold, this one is silver.

Rachel: Huh, well maybe it uh, it changed.

Ross: Oh my God! You actually exchanged it!

Rachel: Well isnât it better that I exchanged it for something that I enjoy and that I can get a lot of use out of?

Ross: What did you get?

Rachel: Credit.

(Thereâs a knock on the door.)

Monica: (running in from her bedroom) Iâll get it! Iâll get it! Iâll get it! Iâll get it! Iâll get it! Iâll get it! Iâll get it! Iâll get it! Iâll get it! Iâll get it! Iâll get it! Iâll get it! Iâll get it! Iâll get it! (opens the door) Hi, Tim.

Tim: Hi. (gives her a bottle of wine)

Monica: Thank you. Come meet my friends. This is uh, Phoebe.

Tim: Hi, nice to meet you.

Monica: And Joey.

Joey: Hey!

Tim: Hi, Joey.

Monica: My brother, Ross.

Ross: Hey.

Monica: And Rachel. (Chandler clears his voice loudly) And thatâs Chandler.

Chandler: How do ya do.

Tim: Whatâsâ¦

Monica: Umm, well, heâsâ¦

Joey: Heâs doinâ some thinkinâ!

[cut to later, Joey, Rachel, Ross, and Tim are watching the football game, and they all cheer loudly.]

Chandler: What happened? What happened?!

Joey: You kissed my girlfriend!

(A commercial for sunglasses comes on.)

Rachel: Ooh, I like those sunglasses.

Ross: Like âem, like âem? Or, Iâd like to get store credit for that amount like âem?

Rachel: (Swears in Italian, itâs the same term used by Joey earlier and Joey nods his approval.)

Monica: All right everybody, this turkey is ready!

Tim: Where can I wash up?

Monica: Here, let me show you. Okay, the towels are hanging next to the sink, and umm, you can use the fancy soap.

Tim: Thank you.

Rachel: Fancy soap? I thought we were savinâ that for the Pope!

Monica: See heâs nice. Right?

Phoebe: Yeah, but Monica, do you actually want to be in a relationship where you can actually use the phrase, "Thatâs not how your dad used to do it."

Tim: Wow! Everything looks great! Where should I sit?

Monica: I saved you a seat. (Motions to the one next to her.)

Rachel: (pouring the wine) Sick-sick-sick-sick.

(Thereâs a loud knocking.)

Phoebe: Oh, Iâll get it. (goes over to the door.)

Chandler: Gotcha! (laughs)

Joey: That doesnât sound like thinking to me!

Chandler: Sorry!

Joey: Yâknow I donât think you should be talking at all in there! I think youâve got to much thinking to do to be talking and making jokes!

Chandler: Okay, okay, you got it!

Rachel: Ross, can you pass me the yams?

Ross: Sure! Oh, and Joeyâs got the mashed potatoes if you want to exchange them.

Rachel: Would you stop?! What is the matter with you?!

Monica: Oh-ho-ho, weâve got company.

Ross: Thereâs nothing the matter with me. See, Iâm not completely devoid of sentiment, see I have feelings.

Rachel: Okay, fine. (She gets up and walks into her bedroom)

(an awkward silence follows)

Chandler: You canât tell, but Iâm trying to break the tension by mooning you guys!

Joey: All right, look! If this is just a big joke to you, then forget about it, all right?! This means something to me! And if it doesnât mean anything to you, then you should get out of there, otherwise youâre just an idiot in a box!

Chandler: Youâre right, and Iâm sorry! This means a lot to me! I want you to be my friend again! I swear, I wonât say another word tonight.

Joey: So are you gonna start taking this thing seriously?

Chandler: Absolutely!

Joey: That sounds like another word to me! Are you gonna take this seriously? (Thereâs no response from Chandler.) Okay.

(Rachel comes back carrying a shoe box.)

Rachel: Donât say that I have no sentiment! (Starts to show Ross whatâs in the box.) This is a movie stub from our first date! This is an eggshell from the first time you made me breakfast in bed! (Holds up a bone) This is from the museum from the first time weâ¦ were together. Okay, maybe I exchange gifts sometimes, but I keep the things that matter!

Ross: I donât know what to say, Iâm sorry. Though, youâre not supposed to take these. (Points to the bone) Itâs like a million years old, we, we actually, we had people looking for that.

(Rachel glares at him.)

[Cut to the balcony with Monica and Tim.]

Monica: (putting off her coat) Ooh, this always happens. (Her coat gets stuck.)

Tim: Here, let me help. (Does so.)

Monica: Thank you.

Tim: You-you have a very beautifulâ¦ eye.

Monica: Yâknow all my friends think this is weird.

Tim: Yâknow I-I thought it was gonna be weird, I mean I almost called and canceled, but it really isnât.

Monica: I know! I mean itâs like me and your dad, thatâs a totally separate thing.

Tim: Oh, I totally agree.

Monica: Weâre just two people who find each other very attractive. Right?

(Tim leans in to kiss her. They stop, and when he tries to kiss her again, Monica pulls away.)

Tim: What?

Monica: Nothing. Nothing.

Tim: No-no really, was-was that not okay?

Monica: No-no-no that was good, it was, that was uh, that was a goood kissâ¦

Tim: Oh my God! It didnât remind you ofâ¦

Monica: (interrupting) Donât say it!

Tim: No, but it did! Didnât it?!

Monica: Yeah!

Tim: Oh man!!

Monica: I know!

(They both shiver in horror.)

[cut to later, Tim has left. Monica is still shivering. Thereâs a knock on the door.]

Joey: Iâll get it. (Itâs Kathy.)

Kathy: (sees itâs Joey) Oh.

Joey: Hey.

Kathy: Hey. Listen, I want you to know how sorry I amâ¦

Joey: Thatâs okay. Chandlerâs the one Iâm mad at.

Kathy: Well, Iâm still sorry. Is he here?

Joey: In the box.

Kathy: (going over to the box) Chandler?

Phoebe: Oh, he-he canât talk right now.

Kathy: Why not? Whatâs going on?

Phoebe: Heâs just trying to show Joey how much he means to him.

Kathy: By being in a box?

Rachel: Joey, had reasons.

Phoebe: They were threefold.

Kathy: Oh. Well uh, (to Chandler) you not being able to talk may make this easier. Listen ummâ¦ (She looks at the gang who are watching, they take the hint and leave them alone.) Listen I donât wanna be someone who comes between two best friends. I just, I canât stand seeing what this is doing to you guys, and I donât wanna be the cause of that. So, I donât think we can see each other anymore. Iâm gonna go to my momâs in Chicago, Iâm gonna stay there for awhile. I think this couldâve be something really amazing, but yâknow this is probably for the best. Yâknow? Iâm gonna miss you. Good-bye, Chandler.

(She gets up and leaves, Chandler waves good-bye with one finger extended through the air hole. Ross glares at Joey.)

Joey: (starting to cry) Open the box!! (Runs over to do so.)

Rachel: What?!

Joey: He can still catch her! Come on, get out of there! (He opens the box) Get out of there!

Chandler: So?

Joey: Yeah, weâre gonna be fine! Get out!

Chandler: Yeah?

Joey: Yeah, you did some real good thinkinâ in there.

Chandler: Man, this isâ¦

(Joey says something unintelligible and they hug.)

Joey: Now go! âCause you can still catch her! And Merry Christmas from youâre secret Santa! (Chandler runs out and closes the door.)

(After heâs gone.)

Joey: All right, who got Chandler? âCause I uh, need to trade.

Ross: Joey, you are gonna love this guy. Gandolf is like the party wizard!

Joey: Well, why do you call him Gandolf?

Joey: No, I had sex in high school.

Rachel: Oh, uh, Joanna I was wondering if I could ask you something. Thereâs an opening for an assistant buyer in Junior Missâ¦

Joanna: (interrupting) Okay, but that would actually be a big step down for me.

Rachel: Well, actually, I meant for me. The hiring committee is meeting people all day andâ¦

Joanna: Oh. Well, I wish I could say no, but you canât stay my assistant forever. Neither can you Sophie, but for different reasons.

Rachel: God, I am so glad you donât have a problem with this, because if you did, I wouldnât even consider applying.

Joanna: Really? Well, in that caseâ¦

Rachel: (interrupting) And thatâs Iâm so gladâ¦ thereâs no problem.

Joanna: Thatâs fine, actually Iâm on the hiring committee, so thereâll be at least one friendly face.

Rachel: Ohh! Thatâs great!

Joanna: You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the ugliest guy to get that job.

Rachel: Really?!

Joanna: No-ho-ho! (pause) Yeah. (pause) I mean, no-no-no-no-no, donât you worry, Iâm sure with your qualifications you wonât need to sleep with some guy to get that job. Although, I might need some convincing.

Rachel: Well, I, ummâ¦

Ross: Somewhere maybe along the equator?

Joey: Okay. (leaves as the phone rings)

Chandler: (answering it) Hello. (listens) (to Ross) Itâs Gandolf!!! (on phone) So, are you in town? (listens) (disappointed) Oh, well, well maybe next time then. (Hangs up)

Ross: What happened?

Chandler: Heâs not gonna make it, heâs stuck in Chicago.

Ross: Ohh, man! Chicago, is sooo lucky!

Chandler: Stupid, useless Canadian money!

[Scene: Bloomingdaleâs, Rachel is meeting with Mr. Posner, Mrs. Lynch, and Joanna the hiring committee.]

Mr. Posner: You have a very impressive resume, Ms. Green. I especially like what I see here about implementing a new filing system.

Rachel: Thank you.

Joanna: Filing system? Oh-oh! You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders? (to the committee) It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.

Rachel: Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.

Mrs. Lynch: I notice that youâve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.

Rachel: Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.

Joanna: Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. Itâs amazing how she gets it right almost every time!

Rachel: I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.

Joanna: Oh yes, well thereâs the coffee too. (to the committee) Rachel can carry two things at once!

Mr. Posner: Yes, thatâs very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.

Rachel: Yes, I realize thatâ¦

Joanna: (interrupting) And Rachel shouldnât have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.

Rachel: I love working with designers!

Joanna: With them, under them, whatâs the difference? Eh, Rach?

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is there as Monica enters carrying a huge stack of newspapers.]

Monica: Hey! My first review is out!

Phoebe: Ohh! Oh, the Chelsea Reporter, ohh, this used to keep me so warm.

Monica: All right, look at my on the back page.

Phoebe: Oh, okay! (reading) "Would I go back to Allesandroâs? Sure, but Iâd have to order two meals, one for me and one for the guy pointing the gun to my head." (to Monica) Wow! You really laid into this place.

Monica: Hey, they donât pay me a penny a word to make friends.

Phoebe: Ooh, I gotta go. I found a guy that who could fix up the van for catering.

Monica: Oh! Do you need me to go with you?

Phoebe: No-no, itâs okay. But are we sure we donât want the waterbed?

Monica: Havenât we made this decision?

Phoebe: Yeah, all right. (starts to leave)

Monica: Bye!

Phoebe: Bye!

(The intercom buzzes.)

Monica: (answering it) Who is it?

Allesandro: Itâs Allesandro, from Allesandroâs.

Monica: Oh my God.

Allesandro: I want to talk to you about your review.

Monica: Oh my God, oh my God. (on intercom) Call me on the phone!

Allesandro: Why? So you could hang up on me?

Monica: Look, I-Iâm never gonna let you up so you may as well just go away.

Allesandro: Just give me a chance tooâ¦

Phoebe: (on intercom) Hey, do you need to get in? Here you go.

Monica: No! Phoebe!

Phoebe: Hey, Monica!

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier.]

Allesandro: (entering) I want a retraction! Our food is not inedible swill!

Monica: I couldnât eat it! I had five friends who couldnât eat it, and one of them eats books.

Allesandro: Well our service is not grossly incompetent.

Monica: The waiter carried the breadsticks in his pants!

Allesandro: Well, you said that we except the Discover Card, which we do not!

Monica: All right, that Iâll retract. But I stand by my review, I know food and that wasnât it. Youâre marinara sauce tasted like tomato juice! You should serve it with vodka and a piece of celery.

Allesandro: Hey! Iâm proud of that sauce, itâs delicious.

Monica: Oh my God! You own an Italian restaurant and you think that tastes good?! Where are you even from?

Allesandro: (shyly) Lebanon.

Monica: Hand me those tomatoes, Iâm gonna show you what it should taste like! Come on, hand me them.

Allesandro: How long is this gonna take? âCause I got another critic to go yell at.

[Scene: Rachelâs office, Rachel is confronting Joanna about her interview.]

Rachel: (entering Joannaâs office) Umm, Joanna? I wanna talk about that interview.

Joanna: I thought it went very well.

Rachel: No! It didnât! Thatâs what I want to talk to you about. (starts to break up) Now, just to brief youâ¦ (starts to cry) I may cry, but they are not tears of sadness or of anger, but just of me having this discussion with you.

Joanna: Rachel, please, donât make a scene.

Rachel: Thereâs nobody here!

Joanna: Sophie, get in here! (Sophie enters) You see! Now youâre making Sophie uncomfortable!

Sophie: Sheâs not making me uncomfortable.

Joanna: Congratulations! You now just crossed the line into completely useless. Get out. (Sophie starts to cry and leaves)

Rachel: Do you want me to quit?

Joanna: What?! What would make you think that?

Rachel: Well of those things that you said in the interview, I mean if you believe any of them, I must not be a very good assistant. Yâknow what? I am just gonna pack up my desk, (She goes over to get all of her belongings from the desk, which amount to a muffin and a pen) and I will be gone by the end of the day! (Realizes she has nothing.) Well, I guess thereâs no use to me sticking around âtil the end of the day! (Starts to leave.)

Joanna: Wait-wait-wait-wait! You can put your sad little muffin back in itâs drawer. If you must know the truth, I didnât want to lose a perfectly good assistant.

Rachel: What?

Joanna: Thatâs why I said all those things about your flirting and your drinkingâ¦

Rachel: My drinking?

Joanna: Oh, I mustâve said that after you left.

Rachel: Said what? Exactly.

Joanna: That you enjoyed the occasional drinkâ¦ing binge.

Rachel: Oh my God!! Ohh, that is it! Iâm leaving! You are just a horrible person!

Joanna: Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!! If youâre gonna get all sensitive about it! I donât want to lose you. What if I, create a position for you? Iâll make you an assistant buyer in this department.

Rachel: Say more things like that.

Joanna: You can have your own office, and a raise! Effective tomorrow.

Rachel: Iâd need an expense account.

Joanna: Done!

Rachel: And an assistant.

Joanna: Sophie, get in here! (Sophie peeks in around the corner)

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Ross and Chandler are watching TV as Joey enters.]

Joey: Hey! What are you guys doing here? I thought youâd be out partying with Gandel-worf.

Ross: Itâs Gandolf, and heâs not coming.

Joey: So youâve been sittinâ around here all morninâ?

Ross: No! I balanced my checkbook.

Chandler: Yeah, and I-I gave first names to all of the foosball players.

Ross: I canât believe he didnât come!

Joey: So what if he didnât come! We can still go out and party ourselves!

Chandler: Oh-no, yâknow with Gandolf weâd be out all night!

Ross: Yeah! Weâd meet, weâd meet total strangers, and hang out with them!

Joey: Well, we could do that!

Ross: Thereâs other stuff too.

Joey: Weâll do it all, and better! Look, after tonight, Gandolf will want to party with us, dude! Come on!

Ross: Yeah!

Joey: Yeah!

Ross: Yeah!!

Joey: Yeah!!

Ross: Itâs not like we donât know how to party!!

Joey: Yeah! All right? Letâs go!

Chandler: And may-maybe we could end up on a boat again?

Joey and Ross: Yeah!!!

Chandler: All right!!

Ross: (to Chandler) Hey-hey-hey, when uh, when were we on a boat?

Chandler: Remember that really cold morning, you woke up and those dogs were licking your face?

Ross: Yeah.

Chandler: Well, those were seals, man.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is entering, excited.]

Rachel: Hey Mon, little question for ya! How do you think this suit will look on an assistant buyer?

Monica: Okay, the owner of Allesandroâs came over to yell at me, but instead I made him some sauce, and he offered me the job as head chef!!

Rachel: Oh my God!! You just ruined the thing I was practicing the whole way home, but Iâm soo happy!

Monica: Can you believe it? I finally get to run my own kitchen!

Rachel: Ohh, youâve waited soo long.

Phoebe: (entering) Hey!

Rachel: Hey, Pheebs, quick question for ya.

Phoebe: Yeah.

Rachel: How do you think this suit would look on an assistant buyer at Bloomingdaleâs?

Phoebe: I donât know, it would totally depend on her coloring andâ¦ (realizes) You got the job!!

Rachel: Yes!!!

Monica: You got the job?! Why didnât you tell me?

Rachel: Ohh, itâs gonna be so great! Iâm gonna get to help decide what we sell, Iâm gonna have an office with walls and everything. (turns to Monica) Iâm gonna have walls!

Phoebe: Okay, is this the day of good news or what? I got us a job! The wedding reception.

Monica: Ohh! Umm, Phoebe, I kinda need to talk to you about that. (Rachel excuses herself) Umm, well I-I-I think it might be time for me to take a step back from catering.

Phoebe: But weâve only had one job.

Monica: I know, but now we have this second one and it just, it feels like itâs snowballing, yâknow?

Phoebe: Yeah! What are you saying?

Monica: I got offered the head chef job at Allesandroâs.

Phoebe: What?

Monica: Itâs okay, âcause y'know what? You donât really need me for the business.

Phoebe: Youâre the cook! With out you itâs just me driving up to peopleâs houses with empty trays and asking for money!

Monica: All right. But umm, I-I-Iâll pay you back all the money you invested, and you can keep the van.

Phoebe: For what? I canât believe this! I gotta get out of here. (leaves)

Monica: Phoebe, wait a minute! (runs after her, leaving Rachel alone)

Rachel: Iâm an assistant buyer!!

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Ross, and Chandler are making a pit stop on their party tour.]

Chandler: Yeah, all right.

Ross: Okay.

Joey: So, weâre having fun, right?

Chandler and Ross: Yeah.

Joey: We donât need that wizard guy. We hit a couple of clubs, talked to some strangers, and uh, after this, weâll head down to the docks and see about that boat thing.

Ross: Iâm kinda beat.

Chandler: Actually, me too.

Joey: Are you serious?!

Chandler and Ross: Yeah.

Joey: Thank God! Iâm exhausted!

Gunther: So you guys want coffees?

Joey: Yeah, but uh, I donât want to be up too late, so uh, Iâll have a decaf.

Ross: Yeah, me too.

Chandler: Actually, can I get some hot water with a little lemon? I think I strained my voice screaming in there. Does it have to be so loud?

Joey: I canât hear a word youâre saying, my ears are ringing so bad.

Ross: Iâm just glad I brought that extra pair of socks, yâknow? I used them as mittens, I didnât want to touch a thing in that last place.

(pause)

Ross: How sad are we?

Joey: Yeah, I know.

Chandler: Yâknow what? Weâre not sad, weâre not sad, weâre just not 21 anymore. Yâknow? Iâm 29 years old, damnit! And I want to sit in a comfortable chair, and watch television and go to bed at a reasonable hour!

Joey and Ross: Yeah!

Joey: Yeah! And I like to hang out in a quiet place where I can talk to my friends.

Chandler and Ross: Yeah!

Ross: And so what if I like to go home, throw on some Kenny G, and take a bath!

Joey: Weâre 29, weâre not women.

[Scene: Central Perk, the next day, Phoebe is there.]

Monica: (entering) Ohh, here you are. Yâknow, Iâm-Iâm glad you decided to hear me out.

Phoebe: Okay, Iâm hearing.

Monica: Iâve been doing a lot of thinking. A lot! And umm, well, I came up with a whole bunch of businesses you can do with your van. Okay umm, you could be flower delivery person.

Phoebe: What?!

Monica: Or! A bakery delivery person.

Phoebe: I wa-I wa-I waâ¦

Monica: Pizza?!

Phoebe: Monica!

Monica: All right, Iâve got a whole bunch of uh-uh, stuff in this area, but umm, Iâm getting the feeling that you donât want to deliver.

Phoebe: No.

Monica: Okay. Iâm guessing that if you donât want to deliver, you probably donât want to pick stuff up either.

Phoebe: No.

Monica: Yâknow what, letâs do the catering business.

Phoebe: Really?! Are you sure?

Monica: Yeah, y'know I-I made a commitment to you. Yâknow what, itâd be, itâd be fun.

Phoebe: Oh! It will be fun! Ohh! Yay! Oh! Okay, ooh, letâs plan the wedding reception. (She grabs the notebook which Monica used for her ideas and starts flipping page after page after page after page after page to find a blank one.) Wow! You really wanted me to do something with this van. (pause) Yâknow what, I want you to take the chef job.

Monica: Really?!

Phoebe: Yeah. Thatâs what you really want. Yeah, I donât want to be the reason youâre unhappy, that would just make me unhappy, and I really donât want to be the reason Iâm unhappy.

Monica: Thank you.

Phoebe: Besides, it might be kinda fun to form the new A-Team.

[Scene: Rachelâs office, she is coming in for the day carrying a picture for her new office. Mrs. Lynch is coming out of Joannaâs office, carrying a box.]

Rachel: Oh, hi Mrs. Lynch! Is Joanna in already?

Mrs. Lynch: Oh my goodness! You havenât heard!

Rachel: Heard what?

Mrs. Lynch: Joanna passed away last night.

Rachel: Oh my God! How?!

Mrs. Lynch: Well, she was leaving work and she was hit by a cab.

Rachel: Oh my God! Oh, I cannot believe it!

Mrs. Lynch: I know!

Rachel: Oh, God. Oh, God. (gets worried) Oh God.

Mrs. Lynch: I didnât realize that she was so close.

Rachel: Yes, so close. Mrs. Lynch, I know that this is an emotional and difficult time, for all of us. But by any chance did Joanna send any paperwork your way beforeâ¦ it happened.

Mrs. Lynch: No. Nothing. Imagine, if she had just stepped off that curb a few seconds later.

Rachel: Yes-yes, just a few seconds and sheâd still be with usânothing about an assistant buyer?

Mrs. Lynch: (starting to cry) No, Iâm sorry. I have to go. (She leaves as Sophie arrives.)

Sophie: (happily) Good morning!

Rachel: Oh, Sophie, I guess you didnât hear about Joannaâ¦

Sophie: I sure did! (smiles)

Closing Credits

[Scene: Monicaâs new kitchen, Allesandro is introducing her to her new employees.]

Allesandro: Iâm so excited about having Monica come on board with us. Although I do feel bad about having fired chef Emillio, itâs like losing a member of the family. Of course, that literally is the case for several of you. Tony, Carlos, Marie, please, tell your father how much weâre gonna miss him. Now, I know that Monica has a lot of great ideas for this place, well, you all read the review. So without much further ado, I present to you our new head chef.

Monica:  Umm, I just wanna say, uh (reads from a 3 X 5 card) that with a pinch of exictement, a dash of hard work, a dollup of cooperation, we can have the recipe... (Looks up and sees eveyone glaring at her) Are you gonna kill me?
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Chandler, and Phoebe are there as Ross enters.]

Ross: Hey!

Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe: Hey!

Ross: Iâm sorry Iâm late, did I miss anything?

Phoebe: Joey stuffing 15 Oreos in his mouth. (Joey, with an obvious mouth full, nods yes.)

Ross: 15? (Joey nods again) Your personal best! (Ross takes an Oreo and Joey mumbles, no!)

Phoebe: Where were you?

Ross: Oh, on a date. Yeah, I met this girl on the train going to a museum upstate.

(simultaneously)

Chandler: Oh, yeah! How did you meet her?

Phoebe: Oh, which museum?

Phoebe: (just Phoebe) No, answer his.

Ross: Okay, it was just me and her at the back of the train, and I sat near the door, so sheâd have to pass by me if she wanted to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy.

Chandler: Were you so late because you were burring this woman?

Ross: No, Iâm getting back down âcause she lives in Poughkeepsie. She seems really great, but sheâs like totally great, but she lives two and a half hours away.

Chandler: How can she be great if sheâs from Poughkeepsie? (laughs, at they all look at him) That joke wouldâve killed in Albany.

Joey: Done! I did it! Heh, whoâs stupid now? (He smiles and has cookie remains all over his teeth.)

Opening Credits

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.]

Chandler: Hey, look at this! (Holding a newspaper) Theyâre lighting the big Christmas tree tonight.

Phoebe: Umm, that paperâs two weeks old.

Chandler: All right, who keeps leaving old newspapers in the trash?! I really wanted to take Kathy to this, I canât believe I missed it.

Rachel: Hey, yâknow, at least you have somebody to miss that stuff with! I hate being alone this time of year! Next thing you know itâll be Valentineâs Day, then my birthday, then bang!âbefore you know it, theyâre lighting that damn tree again. Ohh, I want somebody! (hearing this, Gunther moves in) Yâknow, I want a man!! (Gunther leaves depressed) I mean, it doesnât even have to be a big relationship, yâknow, just like a fling would be great.

Chandler: Really?! I didnât think girls ever just wanted a fling.

Rachel: Well, believe me, itâs been a long time since Iâve been flung.

Joey: Well, I know what Iâm giving you for Christmas.

Chandler: Yâknow what? Thereâs some nice guys at my office, do you want me to set you up?

Rachel: Yeah! Wait a minute, itâs been a long time that Iâve been single. How come you never offered this before?

Chandler: Well, I have a girlfriend, Iâm-Iâm happy. So, I no longer feel the need to go out of my way to stop others from being happy.

Rachel: Okay! No accountants. Oh, and no one from like legal. I donât like guys with boring jobs.

Chandler: Oh and Ross was like what? A lion tamer?

(Monica enters)

All: Hey!

Phoebe: Whatâs wrong Mon?

Monica: Ohh, everybody at the restaurant still hates me.

Phoebe: Oh.

Monica: I thought I was making headway, everyone was smiling at me all day, I get off work and I find out that they wrote this (puts on her chef hat) on my chefâs hat. (The hat says âQuit, bitchâ)

Phoebe: Hey, maybe they meant to write, âQuiet, bitch.â

Rachel: Hey, honey! Whatâs the matter? (Monica shows her, her hat.) Fine, I was just trying to be nice! Whoa!

Monica: I mean I have not been picked on this much since kindergarten and they had to bring in someone from junior high to do the see-saw with me. (Joey laughs and Monica glares at him.)

Joey: Ohhh!

Monica: I mean theyâre trying to do everything they can to make me quit, and if there were any other job, I would. But this is something Iâve been waiting for my whole life.

Rachel: Well, wait a minute, youâre the boss! Why donât you just yell at them? Or, fire them?

Monica: I would love too, but I canât! I mean I just canât, you know that Iâm not good at confrontation.

Chandler: Hey, you know what you can do? I remember reading about this director, I think it was Orson Wells, who at the beginning of the movie would hire somebody, just so he could fire them in front of everybody. Then they would all know, whoâs boss.

Joey: Hey, Mon! Iâm not doing anything, why donât you fire me?

Monica: Thatâs a good idea! Wait, do you know how to waiter?

Joey: Good enough to get fired.

Monica: All right, youâre hired!

Joey: Hey! That must be why I got fired last week! Does this Orson Wells guy direct Burger King commercials?

Chandler: (he glares at him for a while) Yes.

[Scene: Chandlerâs office, he is trying to find Rachel a date.]

Chandler: I say, Drew! Are you seeing anybody right now? (Drew looks at him) Og-ee-op, Iâm not asking for me, Iâmâ¦ I meanâ¦ No, Iâm-Iâm not gay, Iâm not asking you out. Iâm not-Iâm not-Iâm not gay!

Drew: I didnât think you were gay. I do now.

Chandler: See my friend-my friend, Rachel, she wants to be set up.

Drew: Ahh, I just got out of a big relationship, Iâm not looking for any thing serious.

Chandler: Oh, yâknow what, that might be okay even if it was just kind of a fling, that might be all right with Rachel.

Mike: Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa! Is this, hot Rachel, that you took to the Christmas party, Rachel?

Chandler: (to Drew) Oh, by the way, that is her full name.

Mike: Oh wow! Iâm free for her!

Drew: Oh, wait a second! I didnât say I wasnât free!

Mike: Hey, Chandler, why donât we talk this over at the Ranger game tomorrow?

Drew: Hold on, yâknow I just got a box of Cubans, maybe I bring them by your office around uh, five?

Chandler: Oh well, thatâs uh, a little later than I uh, generally care to stay, but sure!

Mike: Maybe, before the game we could enjoy some eight year old some small batch Basel Hadens.

Chandler: Well, I donât really know what that is, but letâs!!

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is working on a new song.]

Rachel: Pheebs, thatâs great!

Phoebe: Oh, yay!

Rachel: But yâknow umm, Rachel doesnât rhyme with draddle.

Phoebe: I know but itâs so hard! Nothing rhymes with your stupid name!

Joey: What are you talking about? Lots of things rhyme with Rachel. Bagel. Mail. Jail. Bail. Able. May-pole.

Phoebe: All good, thanks. (to Rachel) Do you maybe have a nickname have like a nickname thatâs easier to rhyme?

Monica: Didnât your dad used to call you Pumpkin?

Rachel: Oh yeah!

Phoebe: Pumpkin? Yeah. But did he ever call you like, Budolph?

Rachel: Ohh, I like swimmerâs bodies!

Chandler: Yes, and his father invented that magnetic strip on the back of credit cards.

Rachel: Op, I like credit cards!

Chandler: See, Iâm not bad at this fixing up thing, huh?

Rachel: Well, so what does he do?

Chandler: Oh, he works in the Fine Foods division.

Rachel: Your company has a fine foods division?

Chandler: Itâs a big company, I donâtâif youâIâ¦

Joey: Now, wait a second! You make food and robots?

Phoebe: No! No, the robots just work for them.

Monica: (getting up) All right, Iâm gonna go to work. Does anybody have a problem with that?

Joey: Yeah, lady, I do! I got a problem with that!

Monica: You want a problem? Iâll give you a problem!

Joey: Oh, what are you gonna do? Youâre gonna fire me?

Monica: You bet your ass, Iâm gonna fire you! Thank you.

[Scene: Central Perk, Ross, Phoebe, and Chandler are there.]

Ross: Oh, wow! I should get going. I-I got a date tonight.

Chandler: Oh yeah! With who?

Ross: You know that girl I told you about who lives up in Poughkeepsie?

Chandler: Yeah.

Ross: Not her. Yeah, this is someone else I meet, and I-I canât decide between the two of them. Yâknow the one from Poughkeepsie, even though sheâs a two hour train ride away, is really pretty, really smart, and-and a lot of fun. But this other girl, well, she lives right uptown. Yâknow sheâs, well sheâs-sheâs just as pretty, I guess sheâs smart, sheâs not fun.

Phoebe: If sheâs no fun, why do you want to date her at all?

Ross: Well, I-I want to give her another chance, yâknow? She lives so close. And, at the end of the date, the other time, she-she said something that wasâif she was kidding was very funny. On the other hand, if she wasnât kidding, sheâs not fun, sheâs stupid, and kind of a racist.

Joey: (entering) Hey!

Ross: Hey!

Chandler: Hey, man!

Phoebe: Hey! Ooh, how was your first day working at the restaurant?

Joey: (checks his watch) Damn! (runs out to work)

[Scene: Allesandroâs, Monica is cooking.]

Joey: (entering from the dining room) Hey.

Monica: Hey.

Joey: Hey, what happened to your fancy chefâs jacket? (sees thereâs a burn spot on it)

Monica: They baked it. I canât take this anymore. Iâm gonna call a meeting tonight, Iâm gonna fire you tonight.

Joey: You got it! Oh-oh! (He starts patting the burned spot, which just happens to be over her breast.)

Monica: What are you doing?!

Joey: Itâs still a tiny bit on fire there.

Monica: Thanks. (Joeyâs still patting the burn spot) I think you got it!

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is there.]

Rachel: (entering) Chandler!! You have the best taste in men!

Chandler: Well, like father, like son.

Rachel: Patrick and I had such a great time last night! I mean I think this could maybe turn into something serious.

Chandler: Really?! I-I thought you werenât looking for something serious? I thought you were looking for some kind of a fling.

Rachel: Well, y'know, possibly. (pause) You didnât tell him that, though? Right?

Chandler: Ummmmmmmm, no.

Rachel: You told this guy that I was looking for a fling?! You donât tell the guy that!

Chandler: Why not?! Iâd be thrilled if I heard that some hot girl was just looking to getâoh I see.

Rachel: Oh, between you telling him that I wanted to have a fling and me putting out on the first dateâoh, heâs so gonna get the wrong idea.

[Scene: Allesandroâs, Joey is eating some cheese.]

Monica: Hey, Joey, could you pass the cheese?

Joey: Yeah. Listen uh, Iâd prefer it if you didnât call me Joey. Since I donât know anyone here, I thought itâd be cool to try out a cool work nickname.

A Waiter: (entering) Hey, dragon! Hereâs your tips from Monday and Tuesday. (hands him two envelopes)

Joey: (opening an envelope) Thereâs like-thereâs like 300 bucks in this one!

The Waiter: Yeah, people get pretty generous around the holidays. And it never hurts to wear tight trousers.

Monica: Okay. Could the waiters gather around to hear tonightâs specials? Okay, first there is a Chilean Sea Bass prepared with a Mango relish on a bagâWhy is nobody writing these down?

The Waiter: Because we can remember them.

Monica: Because your all gonna make up fake specials and make me cook them like you did the other night?

The Waiter: Well, sure, that too.

Monica: Okay, forget the specials for a minute. Umm, all right hereâs the thing, for the last two weeks I have umm, (quietly) tried really hard to create a positive atmosphereâ¦

The Waiter: Canât hear you!

Monica: (louder) A positive atmosphere! But I-I-I have had it up to here. (She holds her hand over her head as an afterthought.) From now on, it is gonna be my way, or the highway! All right? Does anybody have a problem with that?!! (Joey looks at the money heâs holding, and doesnât speak up.) Hey new guy! I said, does anybody have a problem with that?!

Joey: No maâam.

The Waiter: Hey! He has a name, itâs Dragon. Do you wanna know your name? Check your hat. (to another waiter) We did the hat right? (The other waiter nods yes.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: Allesandroâs, continued from earlier. The other waiters are gone and Monica is confronting Joey about his not speaking up.]

Monica: What the hell happened?!

Joey: I am so-so-so sorry. I was gonna do it! Really! But I was standing there with 327 dollars in one hand and 238 dollars in the other hand, and I was thinking, "Wow! Itâs been a long time since I hadâ¦ (tries to do the math in his head, but canât) 327 + 238 dollars!"

Monica: Joey, we had a deal. That-thatâs why youâre here! Iâve got to fire you!

Joey: And I gotta pay rent! Look, how-how about this? You donât fire me, instead I stay here, I gain their trust, and theyâll start listening to all the nice things Iâve been saying about you.

Monica: What kinda things have you been saying?

Joey: Well nothing yet, they really hate you and I want to fit in.

Chandler: (interrupting) Oh, yâknow, yâknow what Pheebs?

Phoebe: What?

Chandler: Iâm not Jewish, soâ¦

Phoebe: So! Ross doesnât really decorate his tree with floss, but you donât hear him complaining do you? God! (Phoebe hits her guitar which wakes up Ross with a start.)

Chandler: Bad dream?

Ross: I wasnât sleeping.

Chandler: Oh yeah, then uh, what was Phoebeâs song about?

Ross: The one with the cat. I gotta go, Iâve got another date.

Phoebe: So, did you pick one yet?

Ross: No, it turns out that the one from uptown was making a joke. But it was a different joke than I thoughtâit wasnât that funny. So Iâm still torn.

Phoebe: Well look, you donât really like the one from uptown and youâre too exhausted from dating the one up in Poughkeepsie, so I say you just end them both. Okay? You take a train up to Poughkeepsie and break up with her, and on your way back you break up with uptown. And then by the time you get home tonight, youâre done!

Ross: Yâknow, youâre right. Thank you.

Phoebe: Umm, well I had a similar problem when I lived in Prague.

Chandler: Prague?

Phoebe: Thereâs sooo much you donât know.

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is playing living room golf as Rachel enters. Rachel sees this and holds the door open until Chandler is ready to start his swing, when he is, she slams the door shut which causes the club to fly from his hands. He turns around, shocked.]

Rachel: Chandler! Patrick just uh, ended things with me. Did you or did you not tell him that I was looking for a serious relationship?

Chandler: I did! I absolutely did!

Rachel: You idiot!!

Chandler: Iâm sure youâre right, but why?

Rachel: You donât tell a guy that youâre looking for a serious relationship! You donât tell the guy that! Now you scared him away!

Chandler: Oh, man. Iâm sorry, Iâm so-so sorry.

Rachel: Yâknow, you should never be allowed to talk to people!

Chandler: I know! I know!

Rachel: Oh! See just Iâm right back where I started! Aww, this sucks! Being alone, sucks! (She sits down heavily in one of the new chairs)

Chandler: Well, yâknow, youâre-youâre gonna meet somebody! Youâre a great catch! Yâknow when I was telling all those guys about you, I didnât have to lie once. (He sits down on the arm of her chair)

Rachel: Really?

Chandler: Yeah! You graduated Magma Ku Laude, right?

Rachel: No.

Chandler: Oh, it doesnât matter. (Kisses her on the top of her head.) Hey, yâknow what, Iâve got two tickets to tonightâs Rangers game, you wanna come with me?

Rachel: Cute guys in little shorts? Sure.

Chandler: Well, actually itâs a hockey team, so itâs angry Canadians with no teeth.

Rachel: Well that sounds fun too. (They hug.)

(pause)

Chandler: Have you ever been with a woman?

Rachel: What?! Chandler, what is the matter with you?!

Chandler: So there is no good time to ask that question.

The Waiter: You found that handle, did ya?

Monica: Thatâs not funny.

The Waiter: Well thatâs not true.

Monica: (starting to cry) Iâm a good person. And Iâm a good chef, and I donât deserve to have marinara sauce all over me! Yâknow what, if you want me to quit this bad, then all you have to do isâ¦

Joey: (interrupting) Hey! Chef Geller! Yâknow that little speech you made the other day? Well I got a problem with it!

Monica: You do?

Joey: You bet I do! I just ah, wasnât listening then, thatâs all.

Monica: Well if you want a problem? Iâll give you a problem!

Joey: What are you gonna do? Youâre gonna fire me?

Monica: You bet your ass Iâm gonna fire you! Get out of my kitchen! Get out!! (Joey leaves) All right! Anybody else got a problem? How âbout you Chuckles? You think this is funny now?

The Waiter: No.

Monica: How about if I dance around all covered in sauce? Huh? You think itâs funny now?

The Waiter: No, itâs really good.

Woman On Train: I made a bet with myself that you have beautiful eyes. Now that I see them, I win.

Ross: What?

Woman On Train: Weâre at my stop. But would you like to have coffee?

Ross: (now fully awake) Are we really in Montreal?!

Woman On Train: Yes we are. So, coffee?

[Scene: Allesandroâs, Joey is coming back in with his coat on.]

Frank: Oh I know!! (Both he and Alice squeal hysterically)

Phoebe: You guys, why didnât you tell me you were eloping?

Frank: âCause it just sorta happened, yâknow we were at the courthouse, we were having lunchâ¦

Phoebe: Wait, wait, why were you at the courthouse?

Frank: We were having lunch. Yeah and then all of the sudden we were like, "Hey! Y'know, weâre here, having lunch letâs get married!

Frank: Uhh, yeah.

Alice: Weâve been trying to get pregnant, uh pretty much ever since we got engaged, we thought weâd get a jump on things, yâknow no oneâs getting any younger.

Frank: See the thing is umm, weâre not able to yâknow, uh, conceive.

Alice: And weâve tried everything, weâve seen a bunch of doctors.

Frank: Yeah, and they-and they say that our-that our only chance to have a baby is that if they take my sperm, her egg and put it together in a dish and then put it into another girl. So we were wondering if you could be the girl that we could put it into.

Phoebe: (shocked) Thatâs a really nice gift. I was thinking of like a gravy boat.

Opening Credits

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Rachel, and Chandler are trying to throw cards into a vase.]

Joey: (entering with Ross) Hey! You guys! Check it out, check it out! (Heâs wearing a blue blazer) Guess which job I got.

Chandler: I donât know, but Donald Trump wants his blue blazer black.

(The gang is stunned.)

Ross: What?

Chandler: Blue blazer back. He-he wants it back.

Rachel: But you-you said black. Why would he want his blue blazer black?

Chandler: Well, you-you know what I meant.

Monica: No, you messed it up. Youâre stupid.

Chandler: So what job did you get Joe?

Joey: Oh, ah, tour guide at the museum. Yeah, Ross got it for me.

Rachel: Well, how can you be a tour guide, donât you have to be a dinosaur expert or something?

Joey: No, not really. They give you all the information, itâs uh, itâs like memorizing a script. (Making like a tour guide) "And on your left, you have Tyrannosaurus Rex, a carnivore from the Jurassic period.

Chandler, Monica, and Rachel:  Great!! Thatâs great!

Ross: Uh actually Joey, itâs the Cretasous period.

Joey: Yeah but, I can pronounce Jurassic.

Phoebe: (entering) Hey!!

All: Hey!

Phoebe: Guess what. Frank Jr., and Alice got married!

All: Oh my God!!

Phoebe: And! And, theyâre gonna have a baby! (The gang is shocked.) And! And, they want me to grow it for them in my uterus. (The gang is stunned into silence.)

Ross: My God!

Monica: Are you serious?

Phoebe: Yeah

Joey: Youâre really thinking about having sex with your brother?!

Phoebe: Ewww! And "Oh no!" Itâsâthey just want me to be the surrogate. Itâs her-itâs her egg and her sperm, and Iâm-Iâm just the oven, itâs totally their bun.

Joey: Huh.

Monica: What did you tell them?

Phoebe: Well, they said that I had to think about it first, but what is there to think about? Iâm gonna be giving them the greatest gift you can possibly give.

Chandler: Youâre gonna be carrying their baby and give them a Sony Play Station?

Rachel: Honey, this really is an incredible thing to do for them, but there are things to think about.

Monica: Yeah, like youâre gonna be pregnant. I mean pregnant.

Phoebe: I know!

Ross: Pheebs, youâre talking about putting your body through an awful lot, I mean morning sickness, uhh, labour, and itâs all for somebody else!

Phoebe: Yeah, whatâs your point?

Ross: Well, the stuff I just mentioned.

Rachel: Wow! I donât know if I could ever do that. I always figured the first time I had a baby was with somebody I love and that baby would be aâ¦keeper.

Phoebe: Y'know you guys were a lot more supportive when I wanted to make denim furniture.

Joey: No, Pheebs, listen, if you decide to do this, weâll be supportive like crazy.

All: Yeah.

Monica: We just want you to think it through.

Rachel: Yeah, honey, maybe you can talk to somebody whoâs had a baby. Like your mom?

Phoebe: My mom never gave birth. Oh! But my birth mom did.

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Kathy are kissing.]

Kathy: Umm, (moves her handâs down to his butt) I love this touchy. Can I take it to work with me?

Chandler: Oh, yeah, sure, itâs not mine anyway. It can with the pants.

Kathy: Oh! (They kiss and she leaves)

Monica: I am so jealous.

Rachel: You guys are really rightâ¦there arenât you?

Chandler: Yes. Right where?

Monica: In the beginning where yâknow itâs all sex and talking and sex and talking andâ¦

Chandler: Yeah, you-you gotta love the talking.

Monica: And the sex?

Chandler: All right, we havenât had sex yet. Okay, whatâs the big deal? Yâknow? This is special, and I want our love to grow until we move on to the next level.

Rachel: Oh, Chandler that is so nice.

Ross: That is really niceâ¦lying! No way is that the reason!

Rachel: Why? Just because youâre not mature enough to understand something like that?!

Chandler: No, heâs right, Iâm totally lying.

(Ross makes an "I was right, and you werenât face." And Rachel does Rossâs little Iâm-flicking-you-off-but-Iâm-not-giving-you-the-finger banging of the fists.)

Monica: Then what is it?

Chandler: Well, Kathyâs last boyfriend was Joey.

Ross: And youâre afraid you wonât be able toâ¦fill his shoes.

Chandler: No, Iâm afraid I wonât be able to make love as well as him.

Ross: Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.

Chandler: Yes, and I was saying the actual words.

Monica: So big deal, so Joeyâs had a lot of girlfriends, it doesnât mean heâs great in bed.

Chandler: We share a wall! So either heâs great in bed, or she just likes to agree with him a lot.

Monica: Sweetie, with you itâs gonna be different. The sex is gonna be great, âcause you-you guys are in love.

Chandler: Yeah?

Rachel: Yeah!

Ross: Just go for it Chandler.

Monica: Yeah, you should.

Rachel: Yeah, you should, really.

Monica: Go on.

Chandler: All right, all right, Iâll go sleep with my girlfriend. But Iâm just doing it for you guys.

[Scene: The museum, Joey is giving a tour to a bunch of school kids.]

Joey: Okay, now the Mastodon is from the semi-late Jurassic period.

Smart Kid: Isnât the Mastodon from the Pliocene Epic?

Joey: Shhh! This is a museum, no talking. Right down here, (Motions to a fossilised dinosaur foot.) we have a large foot. (Sees Ross working in one of the display cases.) Uhh, and over here we have Ross Geller. (Knocks on the glass) Everyone wave âHiâ to Ross. Ross is one of our most important scientists, look at him, hard at work. (Ross does the old "Putting a cigarette in your ear and pulling it out of your mouth trick.") Okay, moving right along. Come on.

[Scene: Phoebe Sr.âs house, thereâs a knock on the door.]

Phoebe Sr: Itâs open! Come in!

Phoebe: Hi!

Phoebe Sr: Hi!

Phoebe: Iâm sorry, Iâm late.

Phoebe Sr: Oh, thatâs okay, it gave me time to finish glazing my nipples.

Phoebe: Wow! You really go all out when youâre expecting company.

Phoebe Sr: No, I was working on my pottery.

Phoebe: Oh! Ooh! Oh, I didnât know that you didâ¦pot.

Phoebe Sr: Well, yeah, mostly nudes. It combines my two passions, pottery and erotica.

Phoebe: Ooh, erotiery!

Phoebe Sr: Hey! Okay! Well thanks for coming out to see me. I just-I just thought it would be a very good idea to talk about this baby stuff in person. Yâknowâ¦

Phoebe: Okay.

Phoebe Sr: I really donât think itâs a very good idea, Phoebe.

Phoebe: Why not?

Phoebe Sr: Well, because youâd be giving up a baby, and I-I really donâtâI donât know if thereâs anything I can say that could make you understand the pain of giving up a baby. So, umm, (Picks up a puppy in the box next to the couch.)

Phoebe: Oh no! No-no! I understand the pain! Donât-donât hurt the puppy.

Phoebe Sr: No-no-no, the-the puppyâs yours.

Phoebe: Oh, I get a puppy!!

Phoebe Sr: Well, yeah! I mean yeah, but only for three days.

Phoebe: Why?

Phoebe Sr: I realise I donât have any right to start get all parenty on you and everything now, but umm, (Sees that Phoebe isnât paying attention and is busy mimicking the puppy.) uhhâ¦ Phoebe, would you please look at me and not the puppy, itâs very important.

Phoebe: Okay.

Phoebe Sr: I mean, I know what Iâm talking about. I gave up two babies, and I only wish I had someone there that had given up babies, that could tell me how terrible it is to give up babies. I just think that, it would be something you will regret every single day for the rest of your life. So, how ever hard it is to give up this puppy, it would be like a million times harder to give up a child. (Phoebe is playing with the puppy again, and not listening) I really shouldnât have given you the puppy first.

Phoebe: All right, Iâm sorry.

[Scene: The museumâs worker cafeteria, Joey is eating lunch with the rest of the tour guides. Another tour guide tries to sit down in a seat Joey saved for Ross.]

Joey: Uhh, do you mind sitting there. Iâm-Iâm saving this for my friend Ross.

Tour Guide: You mean Dr. Geller?

Joey: Doctor? Wow! I didnât know he had a nickname.

Tour Guide: Oh, he wonât sit here. Only the people in the white coats sit over there, (Points to there table) and only the people in the blue blazers sit here.

Joey: Well, how-how come?

Tour Guide: Thatâs just the way it is.

Joey: Thatâs crazy.

Tour Guide: Maybe itâs crazy in a perfect world, a world without lab coats and blazers, but you not in a perfect world, you in a museum now. See that scientist in the classes, he and I used to play together all the time in grade school, but nowâ¦(Turns around) Peter! Hey, Peter! Itâs me Rhonda! From PS-129! I shared my puddinâ which you man! I gave you my Snack Pack! (to Joey) See, he pretend he donât even here me!

Joey: I-I think everybodyâs pretending they donât hear you. Anyway, look, I donât know about you and your jackets and your separate tables, but Ross is one of my best friends, and if I save him a seat, Iâm telling you, he will sit in it! (Ross enters and goes over to the white table) Ross! Ross! Over here, man! I-I saved you seat.

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey is eating dinner, Monica and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]

Ross: (entering) Hey, uh, Iâm really, really sorry about what happened in the cafeteria today.

Joey: Itâs no big deal. Hey, yâknow, you do what you gotta do. Right?

Ross: But hey, itâs not just me, I mean the scientists and the tour guides never sit together.

Joey: Whatever.

Ross: Itâs like that everywhere, Joey! Okay, Mon, back me up here. Where you work the uh, waiters eat with the waiters, right? And the chefs eat with the other chefs, right?

Monica: I eat by myself in the alley because everybody hates me.

Joey: Look, Ross, really itâs-itâs no big deal. Yâknow you wear a white coat, I wear a blue blazer, if that means we canât be friends at work, then so be it. Yâknow, hey I understand. Yâknow? Hey, when Iâm in a play and youâre in the audience, I donât talk to you, right? So itâs yâknow, itâs uh, itâs cool. Iâll see you tomorrow. (Leaves)

Rachel: Yeah, when weâre in the audience he doesnât talk to us, but he does wave.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next morning, Phoebe is there with her puppy and is trying to sing it to sleep as Chandler enters.]

Chandler: Hi.

Monica: Hey!

Chandler: Why is Phoebe singing to Carl Mulden?

Phoebe: Ooh, yâknow what, I think itâs time for puppy to go out again. Come on, letâs go to the balcony.

Monica: What?!

Phoebe: Umm, the street. Come on, letâs go to the street. Ooh, listen, donât go onto the balcony until after I get back. (Leaves)

Monica: (to Chandler) So, did you do it?

Chandler: Yes, yes, we had the sex.

Monica: Uh-oh, it was bad?

Chandler: It was fine, yâknow? But she didnât agree with me as strongly as she agreed with Joey. She was more like, "I see you point, Iâm all right with it."

Monica: Well, it was the first time. Yâknow, thereâs not always a lot of agreement the first time.

Rachel: Yeah, not girls anyway, guys agree (snaps her fingers) like that.

Chandler: Look, you have to help me! Okay? I mean, I know what to do with a woman, yâknow, I know where everything goes, itâs always nice. But I need to know what makes it go from nice to, "My God! Somebodyâs killing her in there!"

Monica: All right, Iâm gonna show you something a lot of guys donât know. Rach, give me that pad, please? (She does so and Monica starts drawing on it) All right. Nowâ¦

Chandler: Look, you donât have to draw an actual woâwhoa! Sheâs hot!

Monica: Now everybody knows the basic erogenous zones. (She starts labelling them) You got one, two three, four (Chandler is shocked to find out thereâs more than three), five, six, and seven!

Chandler: (shocked) There are seven?!

Rachel: Let me see that. (Monica shows her) Oh, yeah.

Chandler: (Points to one) Thatâs one?

Monica: Itâs kind of an important one!

Chandler: Oh, yâknow-yâknow what, I was looking at it upside down.

Rachel: Well, yâknow, sometimes that helps. (She realises what that couldâve meant.)

Monica: (continuing) Now, most guys will hit uh, 1-2-3 and then go to 7 and set up camp.

Chandler: That-thatâs bad?

Rachel: Well if you go to Disneyland, you donât spend the whole day on the Materhorn.

Chandler: Well you might if it were anything like 7!

Monica: All right uh, the important thing is to take your time, you want to hit âem all, and you mix âem up. You gotta keep them on their toes.

Rachel: Oo, toes!! Well, for some people. (Chandler eyes her and her toes.)

Monica: All right. Umm, you could uh start out with a little 1, a 2, a 1-2-3, 3, 5, a 4, a 3-2, 2, a 2-4-6, 2-4-6, 4, (Rachel starts getting worked up) 2, 2, 4-7, 5-7, 6-7, 7, â¦7..â¦7â¦7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7-7â¦(mouths 7)! (They both lean back on the couch satisfied.)

Older Scientist: Dr. Geller, thereâs a seat over here. (Motions to an empty chair at the âwhiteâ table.)

Ross: Thank you, Dr. Phillips, but Iâm having my lunch at this table, here in the middle. Iâm having lunch right here, with my good friend Joey, if heâll sit with me.

Joey: (standing up) I will sit with you Dr. Geller. (He goes over to his table and they shake hands.)

Ross: Y'know, we work in a museum of natural history, and yet there is something unnatural about the way we eat lunch. Now, I look around this cafeteria, and yâknow what I see, I see-I see division. Division, between people in white coats and people in blue blazers, and I ask myself, "My God why?!" Now, I say we shed these-these coats that separate us, and we get to know the people underneath. (He takes off his coat and throws it down.) Iâm Ross! Iâm divorced, and I have a kid!

Joey: (stands up, and throws his coat on the floor) Iâm Joey! Iâm an actor! I donât know squat about dinosaurs!

Another Tour Guide: (standing up and removing his coat) Iâm Ted, and I just moved here a month ago, and New York really scares me.

Ross: All right, there you go!

Joey: Yeah, you hang in there Teddy!

Older Scientist: Iâm Andrew, and I didnât pay for this pear.

Ross: Okay, good-good for you.

Tour Guide: Iâm Rhonda, (motions to her breasts) and these arenât real! (Joey and Ross look at each other, shocked)

Ross: Wow, Rhonda.

Another Scientist: Iâm Scott.

Ross: Yeah, okay, Scott!

Another Scientist: And I need to flip the light switch on and off 17 times before I leave a room or my family will die.

[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe, with the puppy, Monica, and Rachel are sitting on the couch.]

Phoebe: My momâs gonna be here any minute. I canât do this, I canât give him up. Yesâno, I can. I donât want to. But I can. No.

Rachel: Oo, I canât watch this, itâs like Sophieâs Choice.

Monica: Yâknow, I never saw that.

Rachel: Ooh, it was only okay.

Phoebe: Ooh, I canât do this. My mom was right. If I canât-if I canât give him up, then thereâs no way I can give up a baby. Ohh, God, Frank and Alice are gonna be so crushed. What-what else, what else can I give âemâa kidney!

Alice: (entering with Frank) Hi!

Frank: Hi!

Alice: Uhh, we were just in the neighbourhood, soâ¦

Frank: Yeah, so we just thought weâd stop by and let you know thereâs still no pressure.

Alice: None. But if there was something you wanted to tell us, weâre just gonna be right over there (points to the counter) having coffee.

Phoebe: Okay.

Frank: (noticing the puppy) Oh, whoâs this little guy?! (Grabs the puppy)

Phoebe: Oh! Ooh! Umm!

Frank: Oh, heâs so cute, he reminds me of my old dog, Tumour.

Alice: You are so precious, I could just take you home.

Phoebe: Hey, why donât you?

Frank: Are you serious?

Phoebe: Uh-huh, yeah!

Frank: Oh, thanks.

Monica: What are you doing?

Phoebe: No, Iâm really okay with this. Yâknow why? âCause look at them, and I made that, soâ¦ I know itâs gonna be like a million times harder to give up a baby but, oh my God, itâs gonna feel like a million times better, right? I wanna do this. (To Frank and Alice) I wanna carry your baby.

Alice: (shocked) Oh! Oh! Oh! Thank you so much! You donât know what this means to us! Oh!

Frank: Oh my God, I think Iâm gonna cry!

Monica: Itâs gonna be so great.

Phoebe Sr: (entering) Hi! Whatâs going on?

Phoebe: Oh, I-I gave them the puppy and it made them so happy that I decided Iâm gonna carry their baby.

Phoebe Sr: But Phoebeâ¦

Phoebe: No-no-no, I know, but you and I are different people though, and this is a totally different situation, and I know that I am not gonna regret this.

Phoebe Sr: Oh, I-I-I understand all that, but itâs justâthat was my puppy.

Phoebe: Oh!

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, itâs 0-Dark:30, in other words itâs really, really early. Everyoneâs asleep, and all through the apartments not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. That is except for the chick, who turns out to be a rooster and is crowing in the sun. Needless to say, this awakens Monica and Rachel who rush into their living room, searching for the cause of the sound.]

Rachel: What the hell is that?!! (to Monica) What the hell is that? Is that you? (Monica nods her head no, and Rachel realizes what is making that sound.) Ohhhhhhh! (storms over to Chandler and Joeyâs with Monica in trail.)

Monica: Boy, you are really not a morning person.

Rachel: (angrily) BACK OFF!!! (She starts banging on their door.) Get up! Get up! Get up! God damn it! Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up!!

Rachel: What is that noise?

Chandler: You!

Joey: Itâs the chick! Sheâsâ¦going through some changes.

Monica: What kind of changes?

Chandler: Well the vet seems to think thatâs sheâs becoming a rooster. (The rooster crows.) Weâre getting a second opinion.

Dr. Zane: Um-hmm, five actually.

Phoebe: Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?

Dr. Zane: We do five because that gives you a 25% chance that at least one will attach.

Phoebe: Thatâs it! 25 percent? That means thatâs itâs like 75 percent chance of no baby at all!

Frank: Hey, yâknow I was thinking, what are the odds like if-if, if you stuff like 200 of them in there?

Alice: Sweety, now, sheâs a woman, not a gumball machine.

Phoebe: Okay, well yâknow what, donât worry you guys, âcause Iâm-Iâm gonna do this as many times as it takes to get it right.

Frank: Well, you see, the-the thing is, we-we only got, we kinda have one shot to make it right.

Alice: Umm, it costs $16,000 each time you do this. So, umm, weâre kinda using all the money we have to do it just this one time.

(Ross stops the clock, signifying the end of the lightning round.)

Monica: NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

Rachel: Oh my God.

Chandler and Joey: YEAH!!! YES!!!

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler and Joey are carrying in the foosball table.]

Joey: I call Monicaâs room!

Chandler: You canât just call Monicaâs room.

Joey: Sure I can, standard shotgun rules, Iâm sight of the room and I called it.

(Chandler grunts and turns around, sees that heâs in sight of the room, and mouths damn!)

Monica: Man, I feel like Iâm coming down with something.

Joey: What?

Monica: Yeah. (to Chandler) I bet you canât guess what color my tonsils are? Iâll bet the apartment!

Chandler: Oh, I would never bet this apartment. Itâs too nice.

Phoebe: (entering) Hey!

Chandler: Hey!

Joey: Heyâooh Pheebs, are they in there?

Phoebe: Umm, yeah, uh-huh, theyâre implanted.

Monica: How do you feel?

Phoebe: Well, freaked. âCause it turns out that the odds are really sucky. And! This is Frank and Aliceâs like only shot. Like, they are literally putting all of their eggs in my basket.

Chandler: Yeah, but I bet it works.

Monica: Really?! How much?!

Phoebe: All right, Iâm gonna go take a pregnancy test, right now.

Joey: Oh wow! You can tell this soon.

Phoebe: Well the doctor says it takes a couple days, but my bodyâs always been a little faster than Western medicine.

Rachel: (entering from Chandlerâs bedroom, I guess, and sees the foosball table.) Oh my God! I canât believe you guys are actually think youâre moving in here!

Chandler: Well believe it baby!

Rachel: Well I-I-Iâm not moving.

Joey: What?!

Rachel: No, it was a stupid bet! We were just playing a game!

Joey: You canât just ignore the bet! Itâs a bet! You bet and you bet and if you lose, you lose the bet!

Monica: Look Rach, we have to move. I mean if they had lost, we wouldâve made them get rid of the birds. Right?

Rachel: Noooo.

Monica: All right, look, I hate this as much as you, but if it makes you feel better, itâs all your fault.

Rachel: What?!

Monica: Chinadolor Bong, come on, we steal that TV Guide every week!

Chandler: I knew it!

Rachel: I donât care, Iâm not going anywhere.

Chandler: Cool, girl roommate.

(Phoebe comes in from the bathroom as Rachel sits down in disgust.)

Monica: Well?

Phoebe: Nope, not knocked up yet.

Monica: Itâs only been a couple of hours, so just give it some time.

Phoebe: Yeah, all right. Meanwhile, Iâm gonna do whatever I can to help this so, Iâm just gonna yâknow, lie it your chair, (She climbs into the chair and drapes her feet over the back of the chair.) Y'know? Yeah, good, Iâm let gravity yâknow, do its jobs.

[Cut too later, the moving process is progressing steadily. Monica is trying to lift a heavy box, as Rachel comes in from Chandlerâs bedroom.]

Monica: Hey, Rach, can you give me a hand with this box?

Rachel: No! Put that box down! We are not going anywhere! This is my apartment and I like it! This is a girlâs apartment! That is a boyâs apartment, itâs dirty and it smells. This is pretty. Itâs-itâs so pretty! And look, and itâs-itâs purple! And Iâm telling you, you with the steady hand, I am not moving, and now I have got the steady hand. (She holds out her hand, which is shaking uncontrollably.)

Monica: Iâll take care of it.

Rachel: Thatâs right! You do what the hand says!

[Cut to later, Phoebe is still in the chair and Rachel is laying down as Monica enters.]

Rachel: How did it go?

Monica: I lost our mattresses.

[Cut to still later, Rachel has now resigned herself to move and is now helping Monica. Phoebe is still on the chair.]

Phoebe: (singing) "Are you in there little fetus?
                             In nine will you come great us?
                             I will buy you some Adidas."

(Thereâs a knock on the door and Monica answers it.)

Monica: Hey!

Frank and Alice: (entering) Hi!

Alice: Hi, Phoebe! We were just at the drugstore and we got you a little present.

Phoebe: Oh. Oh.

Frank: Umm, itâs a lollipop and a uh, a home pregnancy test.

Monica: Hey, donât mix those up, you could really ruin that lollipop.

Alice: So umm, you feel like taking a test? Thereâs only one question.

Phoebe: All right, I will. No, I will. But umm, yâknow just remember that itâs still really early, okay so, if it says that Iâm not pregnant, that doesnât mean that Iâm not gonna get pregnant, okay and, and just please, just so I donât go completely nuts, just try not put all your hopes on this.

Alice: Okay.

Frank: Okay. (They both squeal in expectation.)

Phoebe: Great. (Goes to take the test.)

(The door opens and Joey and Chandler ride in on the big, fake dog in triumph)

Rachel: Yâknow what, you are mean boys, who are just being mean!

Joey: Hey, donât get mad at us! No one forced you to raise the stakes!

Rachel: That is not true. She did! She forced me!

Monica: Hey, we would still be living here if hadnât gotten the question wrong!

Rachel: Well it stupid, unfair question!

Ross: Donât blame the questions!

Chandler: Would you all stop yelling in our apartment! You are ruining moving day for us!

Rachel: Will you stop calling it your apartment!

Joey: But it is our apartment!

Rachel: No itâs not!

(They all decay into massive bickering as Phoebe returns from the bathroom.)

Phoebe: You guys! You guys! Youâre gonna have a baby! Theyâre gonna have a baby!

Frank: MY SISTERâS GONNA HAVE MY BABY!!!!!!!

(They all go over and hug Phoebe.)

Phoebe: Okay, but this canât be good for the baby.

All: Oh! (They stop hugging her to let her out and resume the hug without her.)

Closing Credits

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are busy unpacking.]

Monica: I canât find garbage bags!

Rachel: Oh, I think I saw some in here.

(She opens a door and they both scream at horror at whatâs inside of it.)

Monica: What is it?!

Rachel: I donât know! But maybe if we keep that drawer shut, itâll die.

Monica: I canât believe weâre living here!

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, theyâre both unpacked. The big ceramic dog has found a new home in front of the window. Joey screams and runs into the living room.]

Chandler: What?! What-what is it?!

Joey: Did you see the size of the closets?!

Chandler: I canât believe we live here!

(They both sit down on the chairs and put up the foot rest.)

Chandler and Joey: Awwwww!! (They lean back all the way.) Awwwwwww!!!
[Scene: A Theatre, Chandler and Ross are there to watch the premiere of Kathyâs play.]

Chandler: Okay, she is the star of the play. And she is my girlfriend! I get to have sex with the star of the play!

Ross: People can hear you.

Chandler: I know!!

(The play starts.)

Chandler: Wow! She looks great. Doesnât she?

Ross: Yeah.

(Onstage thereâs a knock on the door and Kathy opens it. We donât see whatâs going on, only hear it.)

Kathy's Co-Star: Hi!

Kathy: Hi!

Ross: That is one good looking man!

Chandler: Is it just me, or can you actually see his abs through his overcoat?!

Kathy's Co-Star: Sooo, youâve been doing this long?

Kathy: No, youâre my first. Put the money on the table.

(Ross and Chandler have stunned looks on their faces as Kathy and her co-star start making out.)

Kathy's Co-Star: Oh, yeah! Ooh, thatâs nice. (They start making out harder.)

Ross: Dude!

Kathy's Co-Star: Is that an expensive blouse?

Kathy: If you want it to be.

(Kathyâs co-star rips her blouse off and buttons go flying into the audience, and one hits Ross. Chandlerâs mouth is on the floor.)

Ross: Hereâs your girlfriendâs button. (Holding the button.)

Opening Credits

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica is still unpacking after the move, and Phoebe is their also.]

Phoebe: Oh, hey, Mon, do you still have your like old blouses and dresses from high school?

Monica: Yeah, I think I have some around here somewhere. Why?

Phoebe: Well, itâs just that maternity clothes are so expensive.

(Rachel enters)

Monica: Hey, Rach! I made a pile of your stuff over on this side of the room. If you could justâ¦(Rachel grunts and throws her purse at it)â¦throw your purses at it.

Rachel: Bloomingdaleâs eliminated my department. (Phoebe gasps)

Monica: Oh my God, are you out of a job?

Rachel: No, but they stuck me in personal shopping. Which is just a huge step down!

Phoebe: Personal shopping? What is that? Like where you walk around with snooty rich people and tell them what to buy?

Rachel: Uh-huh.

Phoebe: That sounds great!

Joey: (entering) Hey! (Goes to the fridge.)

Monica: Umm, excuse me, we switched apartments. You canât eat are food anymore, that-that gravy train had ended.

Joey: (Holding a turkey leg) Thereâs gravy?

Monica: If you have the big apartment you have to deal with people coming over all the time. That fridge has got to be stocked, okay, thatâs your department now. (She takes back the turkey leg)

(Joey climbs up on the counter and starts looking at the top of the cabinets.)

Monica: What are you doing?

Joey: I think I left a donut up here.

[Scene: Central Perk, Ross and Chandler are entering after the play. Phoebe and Joey are already there.]

Ross: Hey!

Phoebe: Hey!

Joey: Hey!

Phoebe: Ooh! How was Kathyâs play?

Ross: Well, Kathy gets half-naked and simulates sex with a real good lookinâ guy.

Chandler: Yeah, itâs like someone literally wrote down my worst nightmare and then charged me $32 to see it!

Phoebe: Thatâs a good idea for a business!

Chandler: Iâm totally screwed. Okay, they are gonna be hot and heavy on stage every night, and then theyâre gonna go to their cast parties and heâs gonna try to undermine me. Y'know itâll be like, "So whereâs your boyfriend, whatâs-his-name, Chester?" And sheâll go, "No-no-no, itâs Chandler." And heâll go, "Whatever. Ha-ha-ha-ha!"

Joey: (to Ross) That-that is a good trick.

Chandler: All right, look, look, what am I gonna do?

Joey: Chandler, look theyâre actors. Theyâre there to do a job, just âcause they work together, doesnât mean theyâre gonna get together. I mean just âcause it happened with Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins, it doesnât mean itâs gonna happen with them.

Ross: Oh-oh, Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger.

Joey: Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.

Ross: Yeah.

Phoebe: Hey, Mel Gibson and Clint Eastwood.

Ross: Theyâre not a couple!

Phoebe: Oh-okay, I get the game now.

Joey: Okay look, look, let me ask you a question, when they were doing it on stage, was it like really hot?

Ross: Oh yeah!

Joey: Well okay, so then youâre fine. The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone. Okay? So as long as itâs hot onstage you got nothing to worry about. Itâs when the heat goes away, thatâs when youâre in trouble.

Chandler: Really?

Joey: Look, you guys have been to every play Iâve ever been in, have I ever had chemistry on stage?

Ross: No.

Joey: Noooo!!

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, the gang minus Monica and Rachel are eating breakfast. Ross and Chandler are sitting at the foosball table and eating.]

Chandler: So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?

Ross: Yâknow what, I donât know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend.

Chandler: Yeah, I know butâ¦

Ross: Oh no-no-no, Iâm there.

Monica: (entering) Hey!

Joey: Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?

Monica: You made pancakes?

Joey: Yep! Grab a plate.

Monica: Okay. (She does so and starts to walk towards Joey to receive her pancakes.)

Joey: No-no, stay right there. (Monica stops and Joey flips her a pancake, which flies over her head and lands in the living room.) Gettinâ closer.

Chandler: Okay, okay, but donât worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles, and, jams, jellies, and marmalades. Which Iâm fairly certain are the same thing.

Joey: Listen also weâre uh, weâre watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over.

Ross: Oh yeah!

Monica: Oh, I was thinking about having people over for the game.

Joey: Oh yeah, whoâs playing?

Monica: The players.

Ross: Somebody seems to be missing being the hostess.

Monica: (laughs) Please, itâs a relief is what it is, is what it is.

Joey: All right Pheebs, stick out your plate!

Phoebe: Oh. (Joey flips the pancake and Phoebe catches it and throws it on her plate.)

[Scene: Bloomingdaleâs, Rachelâs new job.]

Rachel: (on the phone) Monica, Iâm quitting! I just helped an 81 year old woman put on a thong and she didnât even buy it! (Pause) Iâm telling you Iâm quitting! Thatâs it! Iâm talking to my boss right now! (Pause) Yes I am! (Pause) Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Yes I am! Okay bye, call me when you get this message. (Hangs up as her boss, Mr. Waltham, walks in.) Oh! Mr. Waltham, I ah really need to talk to you.

Mr. Waltham: In a moment, please, Iâm in the middle of a task. And you have a customer.

(Itâs a really good-looking man, Joshua, that Rachel has an instant crush on. Well actually itâs Tate Donovan, so itâs not like sheâs really testing her acting skills.)

Rachel: Hi!

Joshua: Hi, Iâm Joshua.

Rachel: Hi, Iâm Rachel Green. What can I do for you Joshua?

Joshua: Well, I need a whole new wardrobe. My wife, well my ex-wifeâ¦

Rachel: Oh, Iâm so sorry.

(He walks over to look and some clothes and Rachel quickly turns around and adjusts her bra, trying to show off her assets.)

Joshua: Anyway, she burned all of my clothes. I got away with two things. This suit and what turned out to be a skirt.

Rachel: Well, at least thatâs a great suit.

Joshua: Yeah, but it wasnât much fun dropping it off at the dry cleaners in the skirt. (Rachel laughs) So I need everything down to underwear, so if youâre willing, Iâm all yours.

Rachel: Okay.

Mr. Waltham: Rachel, you needed to speak to me?

Rachel: No-no, that wasnât me! (To Joshua) Well, we should get started. Let me show you my underwear. (Joshua turns at that) The selection of underwear we carry.

(He walks out and Rachel stares at his butt as he leaves. He makes a wrong turn.)

Rachel: Oh-oh, sorry, itâs this way, itâs this way. (Motions to the correct way.)

Joshua: Itâs this way? Sorry. (He walks past her and she again admires his butt.)

[Scene: Kathyâs play, Ross and Chandler are waiting for her in the lobby after the play.]

Chandler: Iâm right! Right? There was like no chemistry between them. Before they had heat, and now thereâs no heat! Now you know what this means, Joey told us what this means!

Ross: All right, letâs not jump to any conclusions. All right? There was some sexual chemistry between them.

Chandler: Come on, it was like cousins having sex up there!

Ross: Here she comes. Donât say a word, okay? Just be cool, donât beâ¦y'know you.

Kathy: Hey you guys!

Ross: Hey!

Kathy: Hi! (Kisses Chandler) Thank you so much for coming again. Did you like it tonight?

Ross: Oh, absolutely! (Chandler mumbles something.)

Kathy: Wasnât Nick funny when he couldnât get his match lit?

(Chandler laughs without opening his mouth.)

Kathy: Itâs a good play, isnât it?

(Chandler mumbles something, and Ross tells him to "Come on.")

Chandler: Oh, I loved the play. You were great, and Nick ditto. Clearly youâre having sex with him.

Ross: Okay, Iâ¦ (Walks away.)

Kathy: Clearly, Iâm having sex with him?

Chandler: Oh come on, it was so obvious! There was no chemistry between you two!

Kathy: Okay, so let me just get this straight. Youâre accusing me of cheating on you, and insulting my performance?

Chandler: Yâknow, I-I could see how this could happen, y'know youâre up there every night, youâre naked, touching, kissing.

Kathy: Acting! Chandler, this is my job! Iâm-Iâm playing a part in a play! How can you not trust me?!

Chandler: Well, you can understand, given how we started.

Kathy: Oh, wow. I canât believe youâre throwing that in my face.

Chandler: Well, that is what happened, and I donât even see you denying this!

Kathy: Iâll tell you what, Chandler, why donât you call me when you grow up!

Chandler: Yeah, well, donât expect that to happen anytime soon!

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Phoebe, and Ross are there eating pizza as Rachel enters.]

Rachel: I have the best job in the entire world! The most adorable guy came over today, and I got to dress him up all day!

Phoebe: Rachel has a new doll.

Rachel: Oh, I wish he was a doll, then I could get a Rachel doll and bump them together and make kissy noises. Oh! And he has the most beautiful name, I never realised it, Joshua! Josh-u-a! Joshua! Josh.

Ross: Uh, hello!

Rachel: Hi-e!!

Phoebe: Ooh, what do I smell?

Joey: I donât know, it smells good.

(He goes over and opens the door to reveal Monica holding a plate of cookies and a fan to blow the smell across the hall.)

Monica: Fresh cookies! Hot from the oven!

Phoebe: Ooh! (They all go over to her apartment)

Monica: Please, have some!

Ross: Oh, yumm!

Monica: Yeah, Iâve just been fiddling around in here making delicious treats for everyone.

Joey: (Holding a magazine) Wow! The new Playboy!

Monica: Yeah, itâs just something I picked up.

Ross: Cookies and porn, youâre the best mom ever!!

(Rachel laughs hysterically for no reason.)

Phoebe: What? What?

Rachel: Well, it was just something Josh said about v-necks, but you had to be there.

Ross: Yeah, how does Jason look in a v-neck?

Rachel: Itâs Joshua.

Ross: Oh, whatever. (Laughs and gives Joey the thumbs up heading back to his apartment. Joey follows him)

Monica: Wait! Wait! This isnât take-out!

Phoebe: (getting up) Well, I hate to eat and run, butâ¦

Monica: No, wait, please donât go! Iâve got porn for you too!

Phoebe: Yeah, I donât need it.

Monica: People are supposed to wanna hang out here!

Rachel: Why? Honey, what is the big deal?

Monica: Iâm the hostess! Not those guys! Iâm always the hostess! I mean, I was always the hostess, I mean even when I was little, I mean the girls brought their dollies to my tea party, I-I served the best air.

Phoebe: Well, why did you make like a whole big thing out of y'know, everyone has to hang out in the big apartment?

Monica: âCause they took our apartment, I wanted to punish them. But Iâm-Iâm done now. Theyâve suffered enough.

Phoebe: If you wanted to punish them, you shouldâve just made them hang out here!

Rachel: Yeah, thatâs true.

Monica: All right then, when Iâm done with this place, itâs gonna be ten times better than that place!

Phoebe: Oh, are we gonna trash that place?

(Chandler comes back, obviously drunk, and trips over the steps.)

Chandler: Steps! (He opens the door to his apartment to Ross and Joey looking at the new Playboy) Slut! (Ross and Joey quickly hide the Playboy behind their backs. Chandler wonders into the girlâs apartment.) You will all be very happy to hear that Kathy is sleeping with that guy!

All: What?!

Ross: So you were right?

Chandler: I confronted her, and she didnât deny it! (Pause) I donât live here! (Goes back into his apartment and they all follow him.)

Ross: Chandler!

Rachel: Chandler, what did she say?

Phoebe: Wait a minute.

Joey: Come here.

Monica: Are you sure?

Chandler: Well, I may be drunk, but I know what she said! Then I went over to Beefsteak Julieâsâ¦

Rachel: Beefsteak Charlieâs?

Chandler: Yes! See you and I have always been likeâ(motions that they think the same.)

[Scene: The hallway between the apartments, Monica is lugging one of those floor polishing machines through the hallway. Rachel comes up the steps and stops when she sees Monica.]

Rachel: Whoops. (Starts to go into Chandler and Joeyâs.) Oh, hey, do you need help with that?

Monica: Nah, I got it.

Rachel: Ooh, I just feel bad, I never vacuum. (She goes into Chandler and Joeyâs.)

[Cut to inside the apartment.]

Rachel: Hi!

All: Hey!

Rachel: So I was with Joshua for an hour today, and he has not asked me out. Itâs just so frustrating!

Phoebe: Why donât you ask him out?

Joey: Oh, yeah, totally! Thatâs such a turn-on!

Rachel: Really? It doesnât seem desperate?

Joey: Oh-ooh, thatâs the turn-on.

Phoebe: He just got a divorce right?

Rachel: Hmm-mmm.

Phoebe: So heâs probably really nervous around women, y'know? Maybe, you just have to make the first move.

Rachel: Yeah but, Iâve never asked a guy out before.

Phoebe: (shocked) Youâve never asked a guy out?!!

Rachel: No. Have you?

Phoebe: Thousands of times!! That doesnât make me sound too good does it?

Rachel: I donât even know how I would go about it.

Joey: Oh-oh-oh-oh, how I do it is, I look a woman up and down and say, "Hey, how you doinâ?"

Phoebe: Oh, please!

Joey: (to Phoebe) Hey, how you doinâ?

(Phoebe looks at him, and then giggles and looks away.)

Rachel: You know what, Iâm gonna do that, Iâm gonna call him up, and Iâm gonna ask him out. I can do that. Ask him out. (Practising) How you doinâ? (Calls him) Hi! Joshua? Itâs Rachel Green from Bloomingdaleâs. (Listens) Yeah, umm, I was wondering if you umm, if you umm, left your wallet at the store today? Well, we found a wallet, and weâ(Listens) the license? Well, that is a good idea! Uh, well, letâs see here this says this license belongs to a uh, uh, belongs to a mister uh, Pheebs, and umm, yeah, so sorry to bother you at home. Iâll see you tomorrow. Bye. (Hangs up) (to Phoebe) Youâve done that a thousand times?

Phoebe: Iâve never done that.

Rachel: Ohh, God, I just got so nervous that he would say no.

Joey: Well, you gotta give him something that he canât say no too. Like uh, Knicks tickets! Invite the guy to a Knicks game, youâre guaranteed heâll say yes!

Rachel: Really?! You think that will work?

Joey: Absolutely! And if it doesnât, can I get the extra ticket?

(We hear a noise coming from Monica and Rachelâs apartment.)

Joey: What the heck is that?

(They go open the door and reveal Monica being spun around on the floor polisher and getting the cord wrapped around her legs.)

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross, Joey, and Phoebe are watching a movie as Chandler comes in from his bedroom.]

Chandler: Did she call?

Phoebe: No, sorry.

Chandler: All right, maybe I should call her.

Joey: No! Forget her, man! You donât need her, you donât need that!

Ross: Heâs right, what she did was unforgivable.

Chandler: Well, yeah, but y'know, what-what if I was wrong?

Ross: How might you be wrong?

Chandler: Well y'know, what if she didnât actually sleep with the guy?

Joey: Dude, tell me she actually told you this.

Chandler: She did not have to tell me, I saw the play, and there was no heat. Back me up here, Ross!

Ross: Thatâs all youâre basing this on?

Chandler: Thatâs not backing me up! Look, you said with the off-stage and the heat, and the onstage and the oy heat.

Joey: Whoa-whoa, that-that was just a theory! Thereâs a lot of theories that didnât pan out. The lone gunman. Communism. Geometry.

Chandler: Oh my God!!

[Scene: Kathyâs apartment, Chandler is knocking on the door.]

Kathy: (opening the door) Hey.

Chandler: Hey. I just, I just wanted to come over to-to say that Iâm sorry. Yâknow? I know I acted like the biggest idiot in the world, and I can completely understand why you were so upset.

Kathy: Oh wow. I really wish youâd call me.

Chandler: Yeah, I know, I-I wish I had too, but yâknow I-I think this is a good thing. Y'know? âCause weâve had our first fight, and now we can move on. Yâknow, I know for meâ(Notices a pair of menâs pants on the chair.) Nickâs pants?

Joey: Okay, for next time, what do you say?

Rachel: I have an extra ticket. An extra ticket. Not, two tickets, I have an extra ticket.

Ross: So the first time you ask a guy out, he-he turns you down?

Rachel: He didnât turn me down! Heâs at the game isnât he? I got the date, Iâm just not on it!

Monica: (entering) Okay, itâs ready. Come on.

Joey: Whatâs ready?

(She has cleaned it, completely redecorated it, removed the carpet, and polished the floor.)

Phoebe: Oh did youâwhat did youâdid you work for two days straight?

Monica: Pretty much. (to Joey) So, what do you, what do you think of the floor?

Joey: I donât know, it looks the same.

Monica: You used to have carpet.

Joey: Oh yeah!

Monica: So I made snacks. Please, just hang out okay? Iâm just gonna rest my eyes just a little bit.

Ross: Look, Mon, do you want us to uh, come back later?

Monica: Oh no-no-no, stay, stay, stay, just keep talking. Iâm always the hostess.

(Chandler returns.)

Ross: Hey!

Joey: Howâd it go?

Chandler: Well, she wasnât sleeping with him.

Phoebe: Oh good!

Chandler: She is now.

Ross: What are you saying?

Chandler: Iâm saying that sheâ¦ is a devil woman! Yâknow I mean you think you know someone and then they turn around and they sleep with Nick! Nick, with his rock hard pecs, and his giant man-nipples! I hate him, I hate her! Well, I donât hate her, I love her. This is all my fault really.

Phoebe: How? How is your fault?

Chandler: Because, I-I shouldâve called! Yâknow if I had just called her after our big, stupid fight, she never wouldâve gone out with Nick, and they wouldâve ended up in bed together. I threw her at his man nipples!

Rachel: Honey, this is not your fault, just because you guys had a fight, it does not justify her sleeping with someone.

Ross: Well, if-if she thought they were on a breakâ¦

(They all turn and glare at him.)

Mr. Waltham: Will you call him?

Rachel: Yes! I will! Absolutely! (She takes out his license and her license and holds them face to face with each other. She then proceeds to act like Dark Helmut in Spaceballs, and mimic a conversation between the two of them.) Hello, Rachel. Hi, Joshua. I left my wallet here on purpose. Really?

End
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey is getting ready for a fishing trip and Phoebe is asking him about the fishing lures. Ross is playing with the rod, and Monica is pretty much just watching the on goings.]

Phoebe: (holding a lure) So now, what is this now?

Joey: Guggly worm.

Phoebe: (laughs and picks up another lure) And this?

Joey: Glow-pop giggly jammer.

Phoebe: (laughs harder) You make it so funny.

Monica: (not wanting to be left out, picks up something) Hey umm, whatâs this?

Joey: (examining it) Ohh, a hunk of sandwich from last year. (Monica drops the sandwich)

Ross: (pretend fishing in the living room) Ohh, Gellerâs got one hooked! Ohh! Looks like a big one! Yeah, ohh! Ohh! (Swinging the rod back and forth) Itâs the classic struggle between man andâ(swings the rod and knocks over a lamp.) Someone knocked over a lamp.

Joey: (going over and picking up the rod) Thatâs all right. Hey you guys, you know whatâs going to be great about the fishing trip this year? When my dad gets me out in the middle of the lake and gives me that, "Joey, what are you doing with your life?" stuff. I can say, "Well, Iâm doing a movie with Charlton Heston dad. What are you doing with your life?"

All: Great!

(Chandler enters from his bedroom, all depressed and wearing sweat pants, with the chick and duck in tow.)

Chandler: You donât have to stop having fun just because Iâm here. Kathy didnât cheat on all of you. (To Joey) Well, except you. (They hug and Chandler goes into the bathroom with the chick and duck following him.)

Monica: Hey, Joey, I donât think that you should leave Chandler alone. I mean itâs only been two days since he broke up with Kathy. Maybe you can go fishing next week?

Joey: Look, thereâs nothing I can do for him right now, heâs still in his sweat pants, thatâs still Phase One. Y'know? Iâll be back for Phase Two, I would never miss Phase Two.

Monica: Whatâs Phase Two?

Joey: Gettinâ drunk and going to a strip club.

Rachel: How does going to a strip club help him better?

Ross: Because there are naked ladies there.

Joey: Which helps him get to Phase Three, picturing yourself with other women.

Ross: There are naked ladies there too.

Joey: Yeah.

Chandler: (opening the bathroom door and kicking out the chick and duck) Would you give me one minute!! Please.

Phoebe: Unless! She wants to spend the night holding my hair back for me.

Rachel: Ohh, gosh. You guys, come on, this isâI have to meet Joshua! This is my one chance for him to see the fun Rachel. Yâknow the "Wouldnât it be great if she was my wife" Rachel. Ohh, all right! Are Joey and Chandler back?

Monica: No, Chandlerâs still in Phase One, and Joeyâs that thing you smell.

Rachel: Ohh! (Realises that Ross is in the room.) Hi!

Monica: (looking out the peephole) Ohh, sheâs looking down the hall. Oh! She looked right at me! Oh wait, you canât see people through that little hole, can you? (Goes back to the door.) Hello!

Woman: Hello! (Monica screams)

Rachel: Iâll be right there! (to Ross) Okay, Ross, please come on! I thought we have moved on! I thought weâve gotten to a place where we could be happy for each other! I mean was that just me?

Emily: Really?! Well, thatâs just lovely, isnât it? I mustâve missed your call, even though I didnât leave the flat all day.

Rachel: Oh well, no Iâ¦

Emily: Oh, no-no-no, thatâs not rude! Itâs perfectly in keeping with a trip that Iâve already been run down by one of your wiener carts, and been strip-searched at John F. Kennedy Airport, apparently to you people, I look like someone whoâs got a balloon full of cocaine stuffed up their bum.

Monica: I-I-I think you look great.

Emily: Good night, it was very nice to meet you all. (Storms out.)

(Pause)

Joey: (running from his bedroom) Oh my God! I overslept! I was supposed to be on the set a half an hour ago! I gotta get out of here!

Monica: Oh wait, Joey, you canât go like that! You stink!

Joey: Look, I know I feel asleep before I could shower and now I donât have time! Theyâre just ten blocks away, if I run, I can make it.

Monica: Yeah. Run ten blocks, thatâll help the smell.

(He opens the door to reveal Rachel.)

Rachel: Heyâwhoa, slow down. (Gets a whiff of him) No, keep moving. (Joey runs off.) Wow!

Monica: So? How did it go with Joshua last night?

Rachel: Well, I didnât see Joshua last night, but I did punch a girl in the face.

Monica: What?

Phoebe: Why?

Rachel: The whole night was horrible, it was pouring down rain, and when I got there, there was no Rachel Green on the list, but there was a Rachel Greep.

Phoebe: Ohh! So, did you get to meet her?

Rachel: No, there is no Rachel Greep, but then this other girl overheard us and she was all, "Iâm Rachel Greep! Iâm Rachel Greep!" and he let her right in.

Monica: So you hit her in the face?

Rachel: No, she was already in, but then this big bitch behind me tried to steal my umbrella, so I clocked her. Ohhh! I canât believe this, all I wanted was a few hours outside of work to see Joshua, so he can go ahead and start falling in love with me.

Phoebe: (going over to comfort her) Aww, Pheebs.

Rachel: Honey, thatâs youâre name.

Phoebe: Thatâs short for Phoebe?! I thought that was just what we called each other!

Chandler: Maybe, she doesnât hit him all the time.

[cut to Ross in Vermont, talking on the phone.]

Ross: When we first met her, she was soaking, her feet were wet! Who wouldnât be miserable? Iâm telling you when I got her into a dry pair of shoes, she was a totally different person.

Emily: (rushing in) Ross! Come quickly! Thereâs a deer just outside eating fruit from the orchard!

Chandler: Okay, Iâm going to go stand over there. (Points and moves into the living room.)

Monica: Why do you care so much anyway?

Rachel: I donât care! All right, yâknow what Iâm just upset that Iâm getting nowhere with Joshua thatâyâknow what still, you do not meet someone and go flitting off to Vermont!

Monica: Well, when you first met Barry, you flitted off to Vail.

Rachel: Oh, yâknow, would you just for once, not remember everyâ¦littleâ¦thing!! (Storms out.)

Chandler: So yâknow, uh, whenâs he getting back?

Monica: What are you doing?! Chandler! You canât just go back a phase!

Chandler: Yes you can. Youâre thinking about time, you canât go back in time.

Monica: Yeah, come on, we can be guys!

Chandler: (laughs) No you canât.

Phoebe: Come on! Let us be guys! Maybe we want to be guys!

Chandler: You donât want to be guys, youâd be all hairy and wouldnât live as long. (Starts to go to his bedroom)

Joey: No-no, itâs uh, itâs Heston.

The A.D: What?

Phoebe: (doing the same) I really, really enjoyed it. Very exotic.

Rachel: (joining them) Well, I just checked our messages and Joshua didnât call. I mean youâd think heâd be worried about me not showing up at his club. Ugh, you know what makes it so much worse, Ross is all happy in Vermont!

Phoebe: Come on! Look where you are!!

Monica: (to the waitress) When you get a sec, another round of daiquiris.

Charlton Heston: Joey, right?

Joey: Yeah.

Charlton Heston: (tosses him a towel, motions for him to get out of the shower and sits down on the couch) Every actor at one time or anotherâopp! (Joey tries to sit down next to him and Heston makes him sit somewhere else.) Every actor thinks he stinks, even Lawrence Oliver at sometimes thought he stank, Bob Redford wonât even watch himself.

Joey: Oh no-no-no, you donât understandâ¦

Charlton Heston: Listen to me!

Joey: Oh yeah, yeah.

Charlton Heston: I donât know one actor worth his salt that didnât say at one time or another, "God, I stink!" Hell, I just did a scene out there, first take, I stunk the place up. But, the important thing you must remember, no matter how badly you think you might stink, you must never, ever bust into my dressing room and use my shower! Do you understand me?!

Joey: Yes sir! Yes sir, Iâm-Iâmâ(he starts to leave)

Charlton Heston: Wait a minute! Take your pants.

Joey: Yeah. Oh, yeah.

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are returning from the strip club.]

Monica: So, we did okay at the strip club, right?

Chandler: Oh yeah, that was great. Thanks to you, the hottest cocktail waitress there is quitting to teach the third grade!

Rachel: (entering) I canât believe it! He still hasnât called.

Phoebe: Who, Josh?

Rachel: Itâs Joshua.

Monica: What, he doesnât like Josh?

Rachel: No, I donât.

Chandler: All right, well Iâm gonna put my sweats back on.

Phoebe: Oh no! Wait! Wait! Okay, yâknow what, you were right, you were right. We really werenât great at being guys, but you know why? Because weâre girls.

Chandler: Yeah?

Phoebe: And do you know what girls are really good at?

Chandler: Stripping!

Phoebe: No, listening! Sit! Yâknow, maybe it would just really, really help if you would just talk.

Rachel: Yeah, come on! Whatâs going in on in there? (Pats his chest.)

Monica: Yeah. And yâknow, if you wanna cry, thatâs okay too.

Chandler: Okay, look, Iâm gonna have to ask you all to leave.

Monica: Come on! Chandler!

Chandler: Look, forget it. We tried, but Phase Three is a lost cause, Okay? Those strippers were insanely hot, and I couldnât picture myself with any of them. (Sits back in disgust.)

Monica: They really were pretty, werenât they? (Rachel and Phoebe both agree)

Phoebe: Yeah, I really liked that fighter pilot one.

Monica: Oh, Candy! She was so spunky!

Phoebe: Yeah.

Monica: Yâknow, I think if I were going to be with a woman. (Chandler is intrigued.) Itâd, itâd be with someone like Michelle, she was so oh, she was so petite.

Rachel: See, I donât know, for me it would have to Chantal.

Monica: Oh, Chantal!

Rachel: Oh my goodness, she had the smoothest skin! I mean when I stuck that dollar bill in her g-string and grazed her thighâ¦

Chandler: (jumping up) Phase Three! I just achieved Phase Three!

Monica: Really?!

Chandler: I am totally picturing you with all those women!

Monica: Thatâs-thatâs not Phase Three.

Chandler: Well, Iâm there too!

Rachel: Well, are we all together? Like in a group?

Chandler: Stop it! Youâre killing me! I think I just moved on to Phase Four!

Phoebe: Oh! What is that? What is that?

Chandler: Where I donât want to have a relationship ever! I just want to have sex with strippers and my friends!!

[Scene: Central Perk, the gang is there, minus Ross. Chandler is trying to cheer Joey up about missing Phase Two.]

Chandler: Come on, let me see that smile.

Joey: I donât wanna.

Chandler: Please?

Joey: I wanted to go to the strip club!

Chandler: I know, I know, but youâre gonna have plenty of chances. There are literally thousands of women out there just waiting to screw me over.

Joey: Yeah, all right. (Ross enters.)

Monica: Hey!

Ross: Hey!

Phoebe: Heyâooh so, how was Vermont?

Ross: Emily isâ¦incredible. I mean there-there are no words to describe it, I mean the whole weekend was like a dream. (Sees Rachel coming back from the bathroom.) Oh! And you! Rach!

Rachel: Oh, hey!

Ross: Hey! You were so right!

Rachel: What?

Ross: Uh, what you said, about us being in a place where we could finally be happy for each other.

Rachel: Oh, hmm.

Ross: I mean, I, I-I admit I-I wasnât quite there. Yâknow, I mean the thought of you and that-that Josh guyâ¦

Rachel: Joshua.

Ross: Joshuaâ¦guy at that club, dancing and having a good time, the thought of it kindaâ¦yâknow.

Rachel: Yeah, Iâ¦

Ross: But now! Iâm there! Iâm totally there! Iâm-Iâm finally where you are!

Rachel: Oh, thank goodness!

Ross: Yeah, and-and thank you for Emily.

Rachel: Oh, no problem. Iâm so glad I could help. Happy for you. (She playfully punches him.)

Ross: Happy for you. (He punches her back.)

Rachel: No, happy for you! (Hits him harder.)

Closing Credits

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, erm, Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is there and is getting ready to direct a bunch of strippers, Monica, Rachel, and Phoebe on what to do in the upcoming orgy of lesbian lust. Yes, itâs a dream sequence, this isnât cable.]

Chandler: All right ladies, hereâs what weâre gonna do. (Points to a stripper.) You are gonna take off my clothes. (To another two strippers) You two, go get the oils. (To another stripper) And you just constantly scream at the top of your voice, "Chandlerâs the king! Chandlerâs the king!"

Phoebe: I-I wanna be with her, (points to the stripper next to her) I like her.

Chandler: Oh, thatâs fine! Go with your instincts, go with your instincts.

Monica: Wait, now, what am I doing again?

Chandler: Come on! Would you please pay attention, I could wake up at any moment!

The Cigarette Guy: Hi, Iâm Joshua, Iâm here to pick up Rachel.

Rachel: No-no-no, thatâ not Joshua.

Chandler: What do you want from me, Iâve never met the guy. So anyway, Rachel, Iâm sorry you canât stay, (Rachel is upset about leaving the orgy with the cigarette guy.) but the rest of us have a lot of work to do. (The cigarette guy starts rubbing Chandlerâs back.) What are you doing? (The guy just nods) All right, listen, Iâve got to wake up!
[Scene: A beauty parlour, Rachel is getting a manicure while Chandler, yes Chandler, is getting a petticure (Does that scare you that I know those terms?  Well, it scares me.).]

Chandler: Y'know, I can't believe I'm getting my nails done!  And you said it was gonna be fun! (pause) Which it kinda is.  Also, you said there would be other guys here. There are no other guys here!

Rachel: Chandler, thereâs a guy right over there. (Points to the counter)

Chandler: Thatâs a mailman! Thatâs our mailman! (Waves to the mailman) (Sarcastic) Hi. How are ya?

Rachel: Chandler, donât worry! This doesnât make you any less of a guy! (Chandler starts blowing on his fingernails like women do.) That does! (Chandler stops blowing.) What am I sitting on? (She looks and finds a huge nail.) I hate to think what this woman was scratching when this broke off.

Chandler: Hey, you know who used to have nails like that?

Rachel: Hmm.

Woman: OHâ¦MYâ¦GAWD!! (Yep, you guessed it. Itâs Janice.)

Opening Credits

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Rachel and Joey are standing at the counter. Monica is flipping a light switch on and off next to the door.]

Monica: Joey let me ask you a question. What does this light switch do?

Joey: Ohh, Nothing.

Monica: Didnât it drive you crazy to have a switch and not know what it did?

Joey: I know what it did! Nothing.

Monica: They wouldnât have put it there if it didnât do something! How can you not care?

Joey: Like this. (Shrugs)

Rachel: Well, hereâs another question for ya. Uhh, do you know what that silver knob on the toilet does?

Joey: Sure! It flushes it.

Rachel: Okay, good. Now that since you know, when you come over would you mind actually using it?

Chandler: (entering, with Janice in tow) Hello!

Joey: Hey! (Sees Janice.) Ah!! (Janice screams in surprise.)

Rachel: Guess who we ran into today?!

Monica: Janice?!

Chandler: Isnât this amazing?

Monica: How have you been?

Janice: Oh well, Iâm divorced.

Phoebe: Ohhh, wow.

Janice: Yeah, Iâm riding the alimony pony. (Does the now famous laugh.)

Janice: Bye.

Chandler: B-bye!

Janice: Bye-bye.

Chandler: Bye. (Finally closes the door on her.) (After itâs closed) I canât stand the woman! (Phoebe is shocked, Joey is relieved.)

Phoebe: What?! I thought you were crazy about her!

Chandler: Yeah, I know, but all of those little annoying things she did before we fell in love? Like her voice, her laugh, her personalityâWell, theyâre all back! Yâknow? And sheâs picked up like nine new ones!

Joey: So what are you doing bringing her here?! Thereâs people here!

Chandler: Donât worry about it. Iâm taking care of it tonight. (Chandler opens the fridge and grabs something to drink.)

Rachel: You are not. You have never been able to break up with her.

Chandler: (standing in the door of the fridge) Well, I donât have to break up with her this time. Weâre not involved! Iâm going to do a pre-emptive strike! Iâm going to end it with her before it starts. My ass is like frozen! (Closes the fridge.)

Joey: Yeah, try sticking it in the freezer for 20 minutes. (They all look around and then back at Joey.) Iâm tellinâ ya!

[Scene: A street, Ross and Emily are walking home from a date.]

Emily: I canât believe you really walk alone here! I mean, you hear such stories about New York.

Ross: No, itâs really not that bad. I mean, I-I for one, feel perfectly safe.

(At that moment two very large men start screaming and running towards Emily and picking her up.)

Ross: Help! Help!! Help! Help!!

Emily: No, no, no Ross! Ross, these are friends of mine from home. (Introducing them) Liam, Devon, this is Ross.

Devon: Hey, mate.

Liam: How are ya man?

Ross: Oh hey, that was a good one, huh? (Imitating himself) Help! Help!

Emily: So how are you? Iâve been meaning to ring you ever since I arrived but umm, well, Iâve been rather busy.

Devon: Do you realise that we have not seen each other since the night of that U2 concert?

Emily: Oh my God. I think youâre right.

Liam: (puts his arm around her) Well, actually the last time you and I saw each other was that morning.

Emily: Oh, Liam. (Ross laughs and takes her back.)

Ross: Oh, Liam. So uh, what, were you guys playing soccer or somethingâor should I call it (In an English accent) football?

Devon: We were playing rugby.

Liam: In fact weâre playing a game at the park tomorrow. Youâre welcome to play too if you want.

Emily: (laughs) Ross play rugby? I donât think so.

Ross: Whatâs ah, whatâs so funny about that?

Emily: Well I mean, youâre American to start with. You donât even have rugby here.

Ross: Well, we didnât have freedom here until 1776, either soâ¦

Devon: So good then! Weâll see you at Riverside Park at 2:00! Cheers!

Liam: Cheers!

Ross: Cheers!

(Liam and Devon both take a swig of their beers, while Ross takes a swig of his coffee. The Brits both crush their cans, and not to be out done, Ross crushes his coffee cup, spilling its contents.)

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is attempting his pre-emptive strike.]

Janice: Oh boy, I just love to sing!

Chandler: Yes, I-I know that you do, but I think one of the reasons people were complaining though, was that they paid to hear the actor sing Old Man River.

Janice: Oh, look at us! Who wouldâve thought that Cupid had a station at 14th Street Nails. (Does the laugh)

Chandler: (laughs) Okay, we have to talk. Iâm just getting out of a very serious relationshipâ¦

Janice: I know! And Iâm just getting out of a marriage, I mean talk about meant to be!

Chandler: Right! I just think that this is happening too soon.

Janice: Oh, too soon, too schmoon. Face it honey, I am not letting you get away this time.

Chandler: I hear ya. (Pause) But! Unfortunately, my company is transferring me overseas!

Janice: Oh no! Where to? (Gasps) Too Paris?

Chandler: No! No! Not, Paris.

Janice:Too London? No-no, Rome? Vienna? Ooh-ooh, Barcelona?

Chandler: Okay, could you just stop talking for a second? (Thinks) Yemen. Thatâs right, yes, Iâm being transferred to Yemen!

Janice: When?

Chandler: I donât know exactly.

Janice: Ugh, well I will just have to soak up every once of Chandler Bing until that moment comes.

Chandler: But I do know that itâs some time tomorrow.

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Monica are plugging in a bunch of electronics.]

Monica: Done?

Phoebe: Yep!

Rachel: (entering, with Joey) Hey!

Joey: Hey! Whatâs up?

Monica: This switch thing has been driving me crazy. So I turned it off and checked every outlet. Now, four of them donât work. Which means, one of them has to be controlled by the switch. So, I plugged in things in all four of the outlets that-that make noise, so that way, when I turn it on I just follow the noise and find out which one it is.

Joey: (to Rachel) I bet I stopped listening before you did.

Rachel: Yâknow, you-you also couldâve used uh, lamps and then followed the light.

Monica: Yeah, well, Iâm using noise. Okay. All right! So, is everybody ready? Here we go. (She flips on the switch and a hum starts.) I hear something! I hear something! Where is it? (They all start looking until Rachel realises itâs Joey.)

Rachel: Itâs coming from Joey!

Phoebe: Oh my God, thatâs so freaky! Turn him off!!

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross, Joey, and Rachel are watching rugby on TV as Phoebe enters.]

Phoebe: Ooh, hey, could we put on the news? I think it might be raining.

Ross: Oh, just hold on a second. Iâm watching this rugby thing on ESPN. I donât know what the big deal is. Iâm man enough to play this sport.

Joey: Dude, youâre not even man enough to order the channel that carries the sport.

Janice: (entering) Hey there Ross!

Ross: (shocked) Hey!

Phoebe: (whispering to Ross) Janice.

Chandler: Yâknow uh, you didnât really have to help me pack.

Janice: Ohh, well when you said all you were going to be doing between now and the time you leave is packing, you didnât really leave me much choice. Did you?

Chandler: Well, I-I thought I did but, I-I guess I did not!

Joey: Hey-hey, whatâs going on?

Chandler: Oh, Iâm packing. Yâknow Iâm-Iâm packing âcause Iâm moving to Yemen tomorrow.

Joey: Thanks for telling me!

(Janice runs into the bedroom.)

Chandler: Iâm only going to pretend Iâm moving to Yemen, itâs the only way I can get rid off her.

Joey: Ohhhh, good one! And Yemen that actually sounds like a real country.

Janice: (leaning in from the bedroom) Chandler! Come on, Iâm gonna show how to roll up your underwear and stuff it in your shoes. Itâs a real space saver.

Phoebe: Yeah, I know, I do that âcause it makes me look taller.

Janice: Okay, Chandler, come on!

Chandler: (to Janice) Okay. (to Joey) Joey, trade lives with me!

Joey: Nope. (To Ross) Man look at this! Ross, I canât believe you said youâd play rugby. I mean look how brutal this is!

Ross: Hey, I can handle it! All right?

Rachel: Please, Ross, you-you got hurt playing badminton with my dad.

Ross: Thatâs âcause-âcause youâre momâs dog kept-kept looking at me.

Joey: (pointing to the TV) Okay, Ross, look-look-look-look, look right here. Thatâs called a scrum, okay? Itâs kinda like a huddle.

Ross: And is a hum, kinda like a scruddle?

Joey: Ross! (Laughs) Theyâre gonna kill you!

Phoebe: Well, why are you doing this anyway?

Ross: Well, you shouldâve seen the guy that she used to go out with. I mean, heâs like Joe Rugby.

Phoebe: Youâre kidding! And he plays rugby?! Thatâs so funny. (Realises) Ohh! I see how you did that. All right.

Ross: Anyway, she thought the very idea of me playing rugby with him was like hilarious. So Iâm gonna show her how tough I really am!

Rachel: (starts laughing, Ross stares at her) Iâm sorry. Iâm sorry. Youâre right, you are a tough guy. Youâre the toughest palaeontologist I know.

Joey: All right, come on look, Ross can take care of himself! Itâs not like heâsâ¦Chandler!

Chandler: (from his bedroom) Thanks!

Ross: Look, donât worry about me. Okay? Iâll just stay real energetic and stay away from the ball. Iâll uh, Iâll be that guy right out of the circle. (He points to a player who starts running and then gets viscously tackled from behind.)

All: Oh!

Rachel: Oh, well maybe there was a dog lookinâ at him.

(Ross turns and wants to attack Rachel, but Joey stops him.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: The park, everyone is warming up for the rugby game. Only Joey and Phoebe came to support Ross.]

Joey: Ross-Ross-Ross-Ross! Stay away from that guy (Points), and that guy (Points). And that oneâDude! Theyâre all huge!

Ross: They donât look any bigger than me!

Joey: Well, maybe thatâs because youâre closer to you. So you look bigger to you from where you are.

Emily: Iâm just going to say hi to the lads. All right?

Ross: All right.

Emily: Okay. (Goes to say hi to the lads.)

(A player comes over and picks up a ball in front of Phoebe.)

Phoebe: (to the player) Hi.

(The player stands up and smiles. Showing that he has no front teeth.)

Phoebe: Whoa! (The player leaves and to Joey) I kinda liked it.

(The referee blows the whistle and the players gather to start the game.)

Ross: Okay, I know what I have to do. Iâve got to go Red Ross. (Joey and Phoebe donât know what heâs talking about.) Yâknow, Red Ross!

Joey: I totally donât know what youâre talking about.

Ross: Come on! The time we were all waiting in line for Dances With Wolves and that one guy cut in line in front of us and I just lost it?! Screamed at him! Turned all red! Red Ross!!

Joey: No.

Ross: Youâll see.

[Cut to Emily, Devon, and Liam]

Emily: Liam, do me a favour. Tell the lads to go easy on Ross, itâs his first time.

Liam: You donât say! (We see Ross who is hopping about with the ball and spikes it in his face.)

Emily: (to Ross) Good luck, babe.

(The scrum forms and the game is underway.)

Liam: Ross! Ross! Come on! Get in here! (Ross gets pumped up.) Ross! Come on!

(Ross walks over to the scrum, walks around a bit looking for a way to get into the scrum.)

Liam: Ross, come on! Get in the bloody scrum! Ross, get in!

(Ross, urged on by his team-mates, jumps on top of the scrum and falls headfirst into the middle, leaving his feet sticking straight up.)

Ross: JOEY!!!!!!

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachelâs, Monica is going over some plans as Rachel enters.]

Rachel: Youâ¦areâ¦not going to believe it! Joshua came into work today, and guess what happened?

Monica: He asked you out?!

Rachel: No. But I was showing him some cufflinks and I felt his pulse.

Monica: Saucy!

Rachel: (refers to the table) What are these?

Monica: Electrical plans for the building.

Rachel: Okay, okay, okay should I be scared?

Monica: I know that switch does something, okay? So-so I went down to city hall and got these. All I had to do was pay $25 and wait in line for three hours.

Rachel: Wow! If only more people knew.

[Scene: The airport, the Yemen Express counter, Chandler is still trying to get rid of Janice.]

Chandler: Yâknow you, really didnât have to take me to the airport.

Janice: Oh please. Every moment is precious. Yâknow? Besides, somebody had to ride in that other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends donât really seem to care too much that youâre leaving.

Chandler: Well, weâre really not that close. (Pause) Okay, so I guess this is uh, good-bye then.

Janice: On no! No! Itâs not good-bye, Iâm not leaving until you get on that plane.

Chandler: Okay. Then I guess itâs just, wait here then. (Hands her the sign that says, Wait Here.") (To the ticket agent) Hi. I need one fake ticket to Yemen.

Ticket Counter Attendant: One ticket to Yemen?

Chandler: Oh no-no-no, no. No, no, no, I just, I just need a pretend ticket.

Ticket Counter Attendant: Iâm sorry sir, I donât understand.

Chandler: What would you give to a kid if he wanted a ticket to play with?

Ticket Counter Attendant: Are you travelling with a child?

Chandler: No. All right, yâknow what, sheâs (Points to Janice) gonna think that Iâm handing you a credit card, but what Iâm really gonna do is hand you a library card.

Ticket Counter Attendant: Ah, sir a ticket to Yemen is $2,100 and we donât take library cards.

Janice: Whatâs the matter? Is something wrong? Do you have to stay?

Chandler: (to the ticket agent) American Express?

[Scene: The rugby game, Ross is getting killed.]

Emily: I canât believe theyâre doing that to him! I told them to go easy on him!

Phoebe: No offence but, yâknow sometimes itâs hard to understand you, yâknow with the accent, soâ¦

(The whistle blows.)

Emily: Thatâs just halftime, thereâs more of this.

(Ross limps over all covered in mud.)

Ross: Did you see me? I was pretty good, huh? That is one fun game!

Emily: Right.

Ross: (to Emily) Hey, could you do me a favour? Could you just grab me a bottle of water?

Emily: Okay.

Ross: Thanks. (When sheâs gone he collapses into Joey.) I-I think Iâm dying. I really do.

Phoebe: Oh, poor baby.

Ross: (to Phoebe) Tell my son that I love him. (Emily returns with the water.) Excellent! Well, okay, I gotta have some more fun!

Emily: Ross, they are killing you out there!

Ross: (whines "No.") Thatâs not true!

Phoebe: Sheâs right! You have to stop!

Ross: What? No! No, Iâm not stopping. Iâm Red Ross!

Joey: Dude, if you go back out there, youâre gonna be Dead Ross!

Ross: I donât care! I am not quitting! I insist on finishing this game!

Emily: All right, all right, if you insist on doing this, at least let me help you.

Ross: No, God no! That is no place for a woman. Those guys will grab anything.

Emily: No. Thatâs not what Iâm saying. I just may know a few things that might help you inflict some pain.

Ross: I like that.

Emily: Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.

Ross: Huh?

Emily: One swift kick and heâll back off.

Ross: All right, bad ankle, got it!

Emily: And that big bloke with the beard, he has got a trick hip. Yeah. And uh, and David over there, I heard he doesnât wear a cup.

Ross: Yeah? I can use that, trick hip, no cup, okay! Okay!

Emily: And uh, Liam, Liamâs got bad knees. You hit him right and heâll go down like a lamp.

Ross: But-but, Liamâs on my team.

Emily: I donât care! You just get him!

Ross: Iâm gonna go get him! Okay, I am going back in! (Squeals like a madman.)

Rachel: Hey!

Monica: Hi!

Rachel: (noticing a bunch of pictures around the door that werenât there originally.) What-what are-what are these?

Monica: Oh, just some pictures I made and hung up. I thought theyâd brighten up the place. They do donât you think?

(Rachel rips one of the wall and finds a huge hole underneath.)

Monica: No-no-no, no!

(Rachel rips off another one, revealing another hole. Rachel then moves onto a third one, but this one doesnât have a hole underneath it.)

Monica: I know that thereâs no hole there, I just really liked that picture.

(Rachel looks at it and then throws it away. She then removes a fourth one, revealing a third hole.)

Rachel: Oh my God! Look at this!

Monica: Okay, but there is a wire back there! I mean that switch is connected to something!

Rachel: I donât care! The wires have come loose in your head!

Monica: I just thought that if I could follow the wire I could find out what it did.

Rachel: And did you?!

Monica: No. It disappears back there behind that baseboard. For a minute there, I thought it went downstairs.

(Rachel removes a paper on the floor which is covering a hole and gasps.)

Monica: But it didnât. Say hello to Mrs. Chatracus.

Rachel: Oh my God.

Mrs. Chatracus: Hello darling.

Rachel: Hello, Mrs. Chatracus.

Phoebe: Now, are you sure you donât want to go see a doctor?

Ross: Oh no! That-thatâll just bring me down! This was great! I mean I-I-I was great! This is a great day! Yâknow what? Iâm buying everyone coffee. All right? If someone would just grab my wallet, itâs in my pocket.

Joey: Yeah, sure.

Ross: No, not you. (Emily gets it.)

Joey: Uhh, look, your eyeâs still popping out a little, Iâm gonna go get some ice.

Phoebe: Ooh, ice! I am so in the mood for ice! (They go and get the coffee and the ice leaving Ross and Emily alone.)

Emily: You were amazing out there.

Ross: Oh, I kinda was, wasnât I?

Emily: Oh my God!

Ross: I made a man twice my size cry. I mean, I havenât done that since I was four and I washed my dadâs Porsche with rocks.

Emily: You really enjoyed yourself didnât you?

Ross: Please! Are you kidding? I-I hurt three huge men, I gave a guy a bloody noseâI mean I-Iâm not proud of it but, I really am. And itâs all because of you, wonderful, amazing you.

Emily: I think youâve got concussion.

Ross: No, no, Iâm serious. Thank you.

Emily: Youâre welcome. (She hugs him tightly and he winces.) Iâm sorry. Did I hurt you?

Ross: Itâs worth the pain. (She goes to hug him again.) Yâknow what, you know what? Itâs not.

[Scene: The airport, the flight to Yemen is being called.]

Ticket Counter Attendant: (on the P.A.) This is the final boarding call for Flight 664 to Yemen.

Chandler: Well, I-I guess I gotta go.

Janice: Oh, my Bing-a-ling. Iâll wait for you. Do you even know how long youâre going to be gone?

Chandler: Well, just until we find an energy source to replace fuel.

Janice: Oh. Well, Iâll right you everyday. (Reading the address) 15 Yemen Road, Yemen.

Chandler: Okay, good-bye. Good-bye.

(He gives the agent his ticket and walks onto the jetway. Janice walks over and looks out the window. Chandler walks back into the terminal and tries to walk right past Janice, but she sees him.)

Janice: Chandler?

Chandler: No!

Janice: Chandler!

Chandler: Janice! There you are! There you are! I had to have one last kiss, and also-also you said that you were going to leave right after I got on the plane!

Janice: No! No! I wanna see you take-off.

Chandler: Well, I then guess Iâm going to Yemen! Iâm going to Yemen! (To this old woman also going to Yemen.) When we get to Yemen, can I stay with you?

Closing Credits

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachelâs, Monica has finally given up on her search to find what the light switch does and is now flicking it on and off aimlessly.]

Monica: All right. The super couldnât figure out what it did. A $200 an hour electrician couldnât figure out what it did. Iâve had seven pretty serious shocks. I officially give up.

Rachel: Thank God.

Monica: I guess Joey was right, it does nothing.

[Cut to Chandler and Joeyâs, Joey and Phoebe are watching TV. The TV is turning off and on, and each time Phoebe is blinking her eyes like the Genie did. The switch obviously controls the outlet which the TV is plugged into.]

Phoebe: See? Iâm doing it. I am totally doing it. (Suddenly it stops working.) I lost it.
[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are there. Phoebe is stressing out about something.]

Monica: What is it hon?

Phoebe: I-I canât find anything that I want to eat! Everything I eat makes me nauseous! Iâm telling you, being pregnant is no piece of cakeâooh! Cake! (Chandler shrugs, and Phoebe grimaces.) No.

Monica: Aww, honey Iâm sorry.

Phoebe: God! Ooh! What is that smell? Itâs coming from the bathroom. Ooh! (She goes to the bathroom.)

Chandler: Wow! Pregnancy does give you some weird cravings.

[Cut to the bathroom, Joey is taking a shower and Phoebe knocks on the door.]

Joey: Yeah?

Phoebe: Itâs me. Itâs Phoebe. Listen thereâs something in here I want to eat, what-what smells so good?

(Joey sticks his head out of the shower curtain.)

Joey: Is it the shampoo? Itâs guava.

Phoebe: (she smells his head) No!

Joey: Oh! Wait-wait! (Reaches inside the shower.) Is it my bologna sandwich?

Phoebe: Yes. Yes. Yes. I canât believe it! The baby wants bologna! Maybe he wants me to eat meat? I canât eat meat!

Joey: Oh, wait-wait! (Reaches into the shower again.) Maybe itâs a pickle?!

(Phoebe grimaces at the smell.)

Opening Credits

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Monica, Joey and Rachel are there. Rachel is writing something on a pad, and then crumples it up and throws it on the floor.]

Chandler: What are you writing?

Rachel: Well, Joshuaâs coming in tomorrow and since I donât have the guts to ask him out, Iâm going to sell him a coat and put this note in the pocket.

Chandler: Oh yeah? (He grabs the pad and starts reading it.) Joshua, give me a call sometime, guys like you (Pause) never go out of styleâwhat did you throw away?

(Ross and Emily enter.)

Chandler: Hi guys!

All: Hey!

Joey: Hey, what have you guys been up too?

Ross: Oh, we went to see a collection of Victorian doorknobs and the Cupert-Hewitt museum.

Chandler: Without me?!

Emily: My uncle dragged us there. But, it actually it turned out to be really interesting.

Ross: Yeah.

Emily: They were so ornate and beautiful, I mean look at that! (Shows them a doorknob she has.)

Monica: I donât know how museums work in England but, here, youâre not supposed to take stuff.

Emily: I uh, I got it from the gift shop. They have really lax security there. (Chandler is shocked.) Itâs a joke. (They all laugh.)

Ross: Bye. (They kiss.)

Emily: Right, Iâve got to be off, Iâll see ya. Buh-bye then. (She leaves.)

Joey: Wow! You guys seem to be having a good time.

Ross: Oh yeah, sheâs-sheâs amazing. And-and sheâs so much fun. And! Yâknow what? When Iâm with her, Iâm fun! I even signed up for helicopter classes. (Chandler is shocked.) Sheâs leaving in two days, I donât have to do it.

Monica: Oh no, two days, you must be bummed.

Ross: Yeah, sheâs got to go back to London. But you know what? Iâve been prepared for this from the start. We both knew we had two weeks together, and thatâs it. Yâknow.

Joey: Hey thatâs what all my relationships are like.

Chandler: Yes, but in Rossâs case, they both know in two weeks thatâs it.

(Phoebe enters.)

Ross: Pheebs!

All: Hey!

Ross: (starts rubbing her belly) Hello! Hello!

Phoebe: (angered by the rubbing) Yes! I know! I know! Yeah! So the baby is totally craving meat. This afternoon I tried tricking it, I made it a soy-burger to make it think it was getting meat, yâknow? And I got nauseous.

Chandler: Maybe thatâs because soy-burgers suck!

Phoebe: Being pregnant is tough on your tummy.

Joey: Hey, but at least you got that cool, pregnant lady glow.

Phoebe: Thatâs sweat. You throw up all morning, youâll have that glow too.

[Scene: Bloomingdaleâs, Rachel is preparing to slip Joshua the note.]

Joshua: (coming in from a changing room) Okay!

Rachel: Oh, hereâs that trench-coat that you wanted.

Joshua: Oh great! (He tries on the coat.) Wow! Yeah, itâs comfortable.

Rachel: Yeah?

Joshua: Man, I could really flash somebody in this thing. (He goes to put his hands in his pockets.)

Rachel: (stopping him) Oh no-no, no-no, they donât want you to put your hands in the pockets until you are out of the store.

Joshua: Why not?!

Rachel: Well, thatâs because of a lot ofâ¦(She imitates someone picking their nose and placing the treasure found in the pockets.)

Joshua: Yâknow, they ruin it for everybody.

Rachel: I know!

Joshua: Yâknow, I wore that cashmere sweater on a date last night.

Rachel: Oh?

Joshua: Yeah, it was my first date since the uh, since the divorce.

Rachel: Well, congratulations, so do you love her?

Joshua: No, no, no, sheâs nice but, yâknow, it just it made me realize that Iâm just not, Iâm just not ready to be dating, yâknow?

Rachel: Huh. Well, uh, thatâs uh, thatâs interesting. (She goes over and retrieves her note.)

Joshua: (noticing her) Hey-whoa-hey-hey, what was that?

Rachel: Oh, itâs just an anti-theft device.

Joshua: Then uh, whatâs-whatâs this? (Shows her the real anti-theft device.)

Rachel: You need that, you need that too âcause obviously, a thief could just tear this up. (Rips up the note.)

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross is writing on the Magna-Doodle as Rachel enters.]

Rachel: Oops, sorry. Listen, we-we have to have a party tonight! Actually, we have to have one in five minutes, so everybody cancel your plans.

Chandler: What are you talking about?

Joey: Yeah, whatâ going on?

Rachel: We have to have a surprise Bon Voyage party for Emily. But itâs actually for Joshua. (Starts handing out party hats.) Look, he said heâs not ready to date, so I had to invite him to a party if I wanted to see him outside of work, and now I have the perfect opportunity to seduce him! (Hands Ross a party hat.)

Ross: Well, as much as Iâd like to meet Josh and warn him, Emily and I arenât going to be here. All right? I mean, sheâs going to come by first to say good-bye, and then Iâve got a whole special evening planned. So Iâm sorry, no party.

Joey: Awwww!

Emily: (entering) Hello?

Rachel: Surprise!!!

Chandler and Joey: Surprise!!

Emily: No oneâs ever thrown me a surprise party before!

Rachel: Well, it was all Rossâs idea.

Emily: Youâre so sweet! And Iâm so surprised!

Ross: You really didnât know?

[Cut to later, the party is in full swing. Rachel is in the kitchen and Chandler goes over to talk to her.]

Chandler: Why are you in here if Joshua is all the way over there? (Points to the living room.)

Rachel: Uhh, because Iâm trying to play hard to get. Oh, quick heâs looking over here, say something funny.

Chandler: Like what?

(Rachel laughs hysterically.)

Joey: What-what-what is so funny?

Chandler: I said, "Like what?"

Joey: Now thatâs a thinker.

Rachel: Okay, yâknow what, yâknow what? This playing hard to get thing is not working. Umm, hand-hand me those cherries. (Chandler does so.) Okay. Okay. (She does a little sexy walk over to where Joshua is standing.) Hi!

Joshua: Hi!

Rachel: Care for a cherry?

Joshua: Oh, no thanks.

Rachel: No? Yâknow, I can tie one of these into a knot using just my tongue.

(She tries to demonstrate this unique ability, but only succeeds in choking on it.)

Joshua: You okay? (Rachel swallowed it whole and is not hacking like a heavy smoker in the morning.) You all right? (Rachel walks away, coughing.)

Ross: (interrupting Monica and Emily) So we should probably get going soon.

Emily: Oh, but the partyâs only just getting started!

Ross: Yeah, but we-we have to be at the Four Seasons for drinks in 15 minutes and then yâknow, then The Plaza for dinner.

Emily: So why did you plan a party at the same time?

Ross: No-no-no, no, umm, actually American surprise parties are-are-are very short. Itâs usually, "Surprise!" And then, "Oh my God, Iâm so surprisedâgood-bye!"

Emily: But Ross, Iâm such having a great time! Your sister has just been telling me that you used to dress up like little, old ladies and hold make-believe tea parties.

Ross: Monica said that did she? (He squeezes Monicaâs knee really hardly and Monica winces in pain.)

[Cut to Joey and Phoebe in the kitchen. Phoebe is watching Joey make a sandwich.]

Phoebe: Ooh, yeah. Then what are you going to put on top of that?

Joey: A little salami.

Phoebe: Ooh yeah! Then umm, what goes on top of the salami?

Joey: Pastrami.

Phoebe: Oooh, yeah. Youâre a genius.

(Rachel enters, she has changed clothes.)

Rachel: Oh, could somebody give me a hand with this zipper?

Joey: Yeah. (He goes over to her.)

Rachel: Up!

Monica: You changed?

Rachel: Yeah, I did. I needed my lucky dress.

Monica: And lucky means, more cleavage?

Chandler: Does for me.

(Joey starts wiping lint off of her back, but goes at little too far and Rachel just glares at him. He stops, gives her the âokayâ symbol and walks away.)

Rachel: Ohh, God! Look at him, heâs so cute. I wanna go over there, grab him, and kiss him! How can I kiss him and not letting him know that I like him?

Joey: Oh! I know how you can get him, take off your bra.

Rachel: What?

Joey: There was a seen in Footloose...

Chandler: Flashdance.

Joey: Yeah-yeah, yeah, with that-that uh, plumber girlâ¦

Chandler: She was a welder.

Joey: What? Were you like in the movie, orâ¦ Anyway, she takes off her bra under her shirt and pulls it out the sleeve. Very sexy, and classy.

Monica: Or if you want to kiss him, umm, you could use mistletoe.

Rachel: Itâs not Christmas!

Monica: Or Spin the Bottle?

Rachel: Heâs not 11!

Emily: (with her coat on, sheâs leaving with Ross) Thank you so much for this. It was really so thoughtful of you.

Rachel: What? Youâre leaving?!

Ross: Yes, we have something we have to get to.

Joshua: Uhh, yeah, I think Iâm going to take-off too.

Rachel: No! You guys canât leave yet! You have to stay, we-we got the whole big thing planned!

Ross: What big thing?

[Cut to later, the whole group is seated on the floor and Rachel is explaining the rules of Spin the Bottle.]

Rachel: (spinning the bottle) So, Spin the Bottle works like this: I spin the bottle, it lands on Gunther, so I would have to kiss Gunther. (She crawls over to where Gunther is sitting and sees the look of anticipation on Guntherâs face and decides not to kiss him.) All right. Who wants to go first?

Emily: Iâll go.

All: Yay!

(Emily spins the bottle and it lands on Joey.)

Joey: Welcome to America. (They both kiss.)

(Joey spins the bottle and it lands on Emily.)

Monica: Two in a row! Youâve got to use your tongues now! (They kiss again.)

Rachel: Yay! Emily!

(Emily spins the bottle and once again, it lands on Joey.)

Chandler: What are the odds? What are the odds?

(They both move to kiss again.)

Ross: (stopping them) Okay, that-thatâs enough! Yâknow, letâs, letâs let someone else play.

Joey: If you didnât want to play, why did you come to the party?

Rachel: Okay, my turn!!

(Rachel spins the bottle and it lands onâ¦.wait for itâ¦.Joshua. (You thought I was going to say Ross, didnât you?) Rachel squeals in delight and starts a slow sexy crawl over to Joshua, making sure he and everyone else watching gets a good look at her cleavage.)

Phoebe: Oh my God!! The baby just kicked!

All: Ohh!

Rachel: Itâs okay! Itâs okay! It kicked once, itâll kick again!

All: Oh my God!

(They all stand up and go over to Phoebe to feel the baby, preventing Rachel from kissing Joshua.)

Rachel: All right, well, everybody just remember where they were sitting.

(She crawls over to Joshua and kisses the back of his knee. He feels it and looks down, Rachel pretends sheâs knocking a bug off his leg.)

Rachel: Just a bug.

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, it is later in the party. The Spin the Bottle game is over and Chandler is making a sandwich as Phoebe watches.]

Phoebe: Yâknow it doesnât matter how much Iâm craving it. Yâknow why Iâm never gonna eat meat? Because itâs murder, cold blooded murder.

Chandler: Okay.

(He takes a bite out of the sandwich and as he does so, Phoebe attacks the other end and starts devouring the sandwich.)

Chandler: Thereâs a Phoebe on my sandwich! (He walks away, giving the sandwich to Phoebe.)

Joey: Phoebe, what-what are you doing?!

Phoebe: I canât help it. I need the meat. The baby needs the meat.

Joey: All right look, yâknow how-yâknow how when youâre dating someone and you donât want to cheat on them, unless itâs with someone really hot?

Phoebe: Yeah, totally!

Joey: All right. Okay. Well this is the same kind of deal. If youâre going to do something wrong, (He grabs two steaks from the freezer) do it right!

[Cut to later, Phoebe is finishing off her steak.]

Joey: Feel better now?

Phoebe: Yeah, but at what cost? Six more months, three meals a day, Iâm gonna eat like, yâknow millions of cows.

Joey: Hey, what if I said, I could even things out for ya, meatwise.

Phoebe: What?

Joey: Well, I eat a lot of meat right?

Phoebe: Yeah.

Joey: Well, suppose until the babyâs born I laid off it. No extra animals would die, you-youâd just be eating my animals.

Phoebe: Joey, I canât believe you would do that for me.

Joey: Absolutely! I could be a vegetarian. Thereâs no meat in beer, right?

[Cut to Ross and Emily standing by the foosball table.]

Ross: Okay, we could still make dinner if we skipped the appetisers and asked for our check right away.

(Rachel enters, she has changed once again. This time into her high school cheerleading uniform.)

Emily: But, we canât go now. It looks like Rachelâs gonna put on a skit.

Monica: Oh my God! Have you lost your mind?

Rachel: No-n-n-n-no! I am finally thinking clearly. My lucky dress wasnât working out to well for me, but for four years, this baby never missed.

Monica: Rachel-Rachel-Rachel I-I cannot, I canât letâ(pause), actually I kinda want to see what happens.

Joshua: Hey!

Rachel: Hi!

Joshua: Nice uh, costume.

Rachel: Ohh, yeah, well I wanted to give Emily a big American good-bye cheer. So okay! (Runs into the living room) Ready! Okay! Gimme an âE!â

All: E!

Rachel: Gimme an âM!â

All: M!

Rachel: Gimme an âI!â

All: I!

Rachel: Gimme an âL!â

All: L!

Rachel: Gimme a âY!â

All: Y!

Rachel: What do you get? (She throws her pom-poms to Joey and Phoebe and performs a cartwheel.) Emily!! (Tries to do another one.) EmilâWhoa!! (She falls in Chandlerâs room.) Okay! So thatâs me as a cheerleader! Ta-dum! (Guntherâs the only one that claps.)

(Joey and Monica rush over to her.)

Joey and Monica: Are you all right?

Rachel: Iâm fine! Iâm fine! Iâm just losing a tooth, itâs no big deal. I have a dentist! Yâknow. Iâm gonna go put some ice on it. Excuse me. (She goes over to the ice and Joey and Monica follow her.) What do I do now? What do I do now?

Monica: I think youâre done.

Joey: Okay, time to take off the bra. (She glares at him.)

Joshua: Umm, that was really great, but I-I gotta take-off actually.

Joey: (trying not to be obvious) Take the bra off.

Rachel: All right, come on, letâs go get your coat.

Joshua: Okay.

(They both go to Chandlerâs bedroom to get his coat.)

[Cut to Gunther and Emily.]

Gunther: Rachel is my girlfriend.

[Cut to Chandlerâs bedroom.]

Joshua: So, this was uh, really fun.

Rachel: Oh, yeah! Real fun. (She makes a decision.) Yâknow, this braâ¦ Really, bothers me. (She starts taking off her bra.) Yâknow, this used to be my bedroom. Yeah. A lot of memories in here, a lot of memories. If these walls could talk, yâknow what theyâd say? Wanna hear some memories? (She is now violently pulling on her bra in order to remove it, but it isnât co-operating.)

Joshua: Need uh, need a little hand there.

Rachel: Oh no-no-no! No, I got this all under control.

Joshua: You really donât seem like you do. Thatâsâ¦

(She is still yanking on the bra, but it is stuck in her sleeve. Finally, she gives up.)

Rachel: Ughhhh!! Forget it! (Sits down heavily on the bed.) This is, this is not how this is supposed to happen.

Joshua: Well, what was supposed to happen?

Rachel: Can you not look at me when I say this? (He turns around) I thought that if I could get you here, I could seduce you.

Joshua: Huh. Oh, boy! (Sits down next to her.) Uhh, I-I donât wear suits to work, and I bought six of them from you.

Rachel: Well, Iâm sorry, I thought you needed them!

Joshua: No, no-no, no-no, my point is that I kept coming back because, I wanted to see you.

Rachel: Why?!

Joshua: Because I-I like you.

Rachel: You like me?

Joshua: Yeah! I mean youâre-youâre beautiful and smart and sophisticatedâa lot of this isnât based on tonight.

Rachel: Yeah but-but-but you liked me! Oh my God, I canât believe this, all this time, I liked you and you liked me!

Joshua: Butâ¦

Rachel: Oh no-no-no donât say but! No-no, butâs never good! Letâs just leave it at, you like me and I like you.

Joshua: Okay uh, howeverâ¦

Rachel: Oh, now see thatâs a fancy but.

Joshua: My marriage like just ended, and Iâm really not ready to get into anything yet.

Rachel: Butâ¦.

Joshua: Iâm sorry, I, I just need a little time.

Rachel: Okay.

[Scene: The hallway, Ross is sitting on the step drinking a beer as Rachel comes out of the guys apartment.]

Rachel: Ohh, here you are. I was looking for you before. Joshuaâs gone so you and Emily are free to go.

Ross: Thatâs okay. Sheâs still in there enjoying her fake party and uh, itâs too late to do any of the things I had planned, soâ¦

Rachel: Oh, Ross, Iâm sorry. I completely ruined your evening.

Ross: Yeah.

Rachel: Well, if it makes you feel any better, I made a fool out of myself.

Ross: Helps a little.

Rachel: Is there room on that step for a pathetic loser?

Ross: Yeah, have a seat.

Rachel: Iâm so sorry.

Ross: Thatâs okay, I mean it was just two-week thing anyway, I just didnât want it to end this way, yâknow?

Rachel: Well, maybe you didnât want it to end?

Ross: What do you mean?

Rachel: You seem to really like her.

Ross: Yeah, I really do. Yeah, but what am I gonna do, I mean we-we both agreed that it was gonna be a two-week thing, yâknow no commitment.

Rachel: Ross, that girl just spent the entire evening talking to your friends, asking to hear stories about you, looking through Monicaâs photo albums, I mean you donât do that if youâre just in it for two weeks.

Ross: You think?

Rachel: Yeah, you got like 14 hours until she has to be at the airport, and youâre sitting here in the hallway with a 28-year-old cheerleader with a fat lip.

Ross: Hey, youâre right.

Rachel: Yeah.

Ross: Thanks. (He starts to go inside and stops.) What photo album was it?

Rachel: I donât know, it was you and a bunch of albino kids.

Ross: Oh my God! Those werenât albino kids, that was computer camp! Rach! (He hurries inside and Chandler is taking out the garbage.)

Rachel: Hey.

Chandler: Hey.

Rachel: Youâre a pathetic loser, right?

Chandler: Oh-ho, yeah!

Rachel: Sit!

(He does so, and immediately starts looking pathetic.)

Joshua: Hi. (He has just returned.)

Rachel: Oh my gosh, Joshua!

Joshua: All those things I said about not being readyâ¦

Rachel: Theyâre not true?

Joshua: No, theyâre-theyâre all true.

Rachel: Oh.

Joshua: Butâ¦

Rachel: Oh! Oh, I love that but.

(They move to kiss, but realise that Chandler is staring at them. Chandler urges them on.)

Rachel: You wanna go inside and have some coffee?

Joshua: Yeah.

Rachel: Okay. (Joshua goes inside and to Chandler.) Every time.

Phoebe: Pastrami.

Joey: Oh-ho-ho, yeah! Hey! Yâknow what goes good with that?

Phoebe: Hm-mm, corn beef.

Joey: Ooh, I was gonna say bologna, but thatâs much better. How about a little of that smoked turkey?

Phoebe: Okay.

Joey: (He starts looking longingly at the sandwich.) Oh mama! Uh when-when is the baby due?

Phoebe: Six months.

Joey: Ugh. Now if a cow should die of natural causes, I can have one of those right?

Phoebe: Not if I get there first.



[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is watching TV, and we hear Mr. Treeger in the bathroom.]

Mr. Treeger: Ohhh, man!!

Joey: (coming in from his bedroom) What is that?

Chandler: Treegerâs snaking the shower drain.

Mr. Treeger: What in the name of hell?

Joey: Maybe he found you flip-flop.

(Joey sits down and changes the channel, and we see two people making out.)

Chandler: Hey!

Joey: Whoa! Is this porn? What did I do? I mustâve hit something on the remote.

Chandler: Do we pay for this?

Joey: No, we didnât even pay our cable billâmaybe this is how they punish us.

Chandler: Maybe we shouldnât pay our phone billâfree phone sex.

Joey: Maybe we shouldnât pay our gas bill? (Stops and thinks about what he just said.)

Mr. Treeger: (coming in from the bathroom) Whoa, hey, that ladyâs all kinds of naked.

Chandler: Yeah, Joey just pressed something on the remote and it just, came on!

Mr. Treeger: Yeah, it happened to me once. I was just flipping through the channels and bam! It was like finding money.

Chandler: Like finding money with naked people on it!

Mr. Treeger: Then I made the mistake of turning off the TV, I never got it back again. And Iâm sad. (Exits.)

Joey: (to Chandler) Why would he turn off the TV? (Chandler shrugs.)

Opening Credits

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, later that morning. The porn is still on, there are three women getting ready to shave the chest of some guy. Joey and Chandler are wondering why that guy is letting them shave his chest, and Monica and Rachel are eating breakfast at the foosball table.]

Rachel: All right, yâknow what, come on, do we really have to watch this while we eat? (She makes a move for the remote.)

Joey and Chandler: (stopping her) Oh no-no-no-no!

Chandler: We donât know what could make this go away.

Joey: Yeah, so no one touches the remote. And no one touches the TV!

Chandler: And no one touches the air around the TV!

Joey: Imagine a protective porn bubble if you will, okay?

Monica: Well at least, Iâm going to mute it.

Joey and Chandler: Oh no-no-no! (Monica mutes the TV and they tentatively look behind them)

Chandler: We still have porn.

Joey: Hey.

Phoebe: (entering, carrying her massage table) Hi!

Monica: Hi!

Rachel: Honey, what are you doing? Thatâs too heavy.

Phoebe: Yeah.

Rachel: Give it here. (She takes the table.) Oh, God. (And gives it to Monica right away.)

Monica: Okay.

Phoebe: Ohh, Iâm getting too pregnant for this, lugging around a stupid massage table. Yâknow, I have to find a job where I carrying a smaller table. (She goes over and stands in front of the TV.)

Chandler: Or a job where you donât have to carry a table.

Phoebe: You mean like a doctor?

Joey: Pheebs! Youâre blocking the porn! Look out!

Phoebe: Ohh! (She moves.) Oh my. Oh, that reminds me, I have to see my OB-GYN today.

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering.]

Ross: Hi.

Monica: Hi.

Ross: So uh, Emily just went to the airport.

Monica: Oh. Why didnât you take her?

Ross: Eh, her-her uncle already had planned on doing it. And yâknow, we-we said our good-byes this morning, soâ¦

Monica: You must feel horrible. Hey! The guys have free porn!

Ross: (Thinks about it.) Nah.

Monica: Hey, cheer up! Youâre gonna see her again, right?

Ross: Well I, thatâs the thing, I donât know! I mean, whenever I brought it up with her she said, (In a British accent.) "This is so fantastic! Why do we have to talk about the future? Letâs just enjoyâ¦"

Monica: (interrupting him) No-no-no, donât-donât do the accent. Youâve got to see her again.

Ross: And why do you care so much?

Monica: Because! You could get to live out my fantasy!

Ross: You had fantasies about Emily?

Monica: No! Yâknow, the fantasy! Meet someone from a strange land, fall in madly love, and spend the rest of your lives together.

Ross: Is that why in junior high you were the only one that hung out with that Ukrainian kid?

Monica: Yeah that, plus his mom used to put sour cream on everything!

Ross: Ahh.

Monica: Do you love her?

Ross: We said it was only going to be two weeks, yâknow?

Monica: You love her!

Ross: What-what is love really?

Monica: Ohhh, I knew you loved her! Then you need to go to the airport and tell her. Youâre probably just gonna catch her just as sheâs about to go to the gate. Youâre gonna call out her name and say, "I love you!" And sheâs gonna say, "I love you, too!" And you guys are going to have the most amazing kiss, everyone at the gate will applaud.

Ross: I am a good kisser.

Monica: Then you two can, can sneak into the cockpit, and things will start to heat up, and then a stewardess comes inâ¦ (Ross looks at her.) Iâve been watching too much porn.

[Scene: Beth Israel Medical Center, Phoebe is at her OB-GYN doing an ultrasound, Rachel is with her. We here the babyâs heartbeat.]

Rachel: Is that the heartbeat?

The Doctor: Thatâs it.

Phoebe: Oh my God!

Rachel: Oh wow! This is so cool.

(The heartbeat changes, and we hear a different one.)

The Doctor: Have we talked about the possibility of multiple births?

Phoebe: Why donât take care of this one, and should I get pregnant again, Iâll hold onto your card, okay?

The Doctor: No, Iâm getting three separate heartbeats.

Phoebe: Three? You guys were worried I wouldnât even have one!

The Doctor: Doctors are wrong all the time.

Phoebe: Well, yeah.

Rachel: Well, so, are-are you sure that there are three?!

The Doctor: Definitely. (Points out each head on the ultrasound.)

Phoebe: Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!! So I-I mean so in a few months Iâm going to have three full grown babies just walkinâ around inside me?! Oh! Oh! And itâs gonna be one of those log rides where they just come shooting out!

The Doctor: Actually, giving birth to three babies isnât that different from giving birth to one.

Phoebe: What do you know?!

[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there, waiting to tell Frank and Alice the news.]

Alice: (entering) Oh-oh, Phoebe!

Phoebe: Ooh! Hi!

Alice: Hi! (She runs over and hugs Phoebeâs stomach.) So, how did it go at the doctors?

Phoebe: Oh well, okay, hey, yâknow how when youâre umm, youâre walking down the street and you see three people in a row, and you say, "Oh, thatâs nice?"

Frank: Yes.

Phoebe: Okay, yeah well, good news, youâre going to have three babies.

Alice: Three babies?

Frank: I finally got my band!

Alice: Weâre gonna have a big family, Iâve always wanted a big family!

Phoebe: Oh God, Iâm so glad you guys are happy, I was so afraid you were going to be all freaked.

Frank: Why would we be freaked?

Phoebe: No, no maybe âcause itâs harder to raise them, and the added expense, andâ¦

Frank: (Theyâre less than happy now) Oh.

Alice: Right.

Phoebe: No, back to happy. Back to happy!

Alice: No-no-no, no, itâs going to be fine. Because umm, because I teach Home Ec, and uh, I can have 30 kids making baby clothes all year long. Yâknow itâll-itâll be like my very own little sweatshop.

Frank: Yeah, Iâve been thinking ever since you said we were having triplets, the best thing for me to do is to drop out of college and get a job.

Alice: No, Frank.

Phoebe: No you canât quit college! No! Youâre in college? Really?

Frank: Yeah, refrigerator college.

Alice: Yeah.

Frank: Yeah, yâknow when we found out we were going to have a baby, yâknow I figured yâknow like I should yâknow have like a careerâand I love refrigerators!

Phoebe: You canât give up on your dream.

Frank: No, itâs okay. Weâre-weâre gonna have three kids! And thatâs-thatâs a different kind of dream. Three kids and no money.

[Scene: The airport, Emily is getting ready to board her flight to London.]

Ticket Agent: (On the P.A.) This is the boarding call for Flight 009.

Ross: Emily! (Runs up.)

Emily: Oh my God! What are you doing here? (They hug)

Ross: I just, I had to see you one more time before you took-off.

Emily: You are so sweet. (They kiss.)

Ross: Thatâs, thatâs, thatâs a big candy bar. (Sheâs holding one of those huge Toblerone bars.) I had the most amazing time with you.

Emily: Me too.

Ticket Agent: This is the final boarding call for Flight 009.

Emily: Well, thatâ me. (They kiss again.) Here, have this. (She gives him the candy bar.) Iâm only allowed one piece of carryon anyway. (She starts towards the jetway.)

Ross: (stops her) Wait uh, listen. I-I, I have to tell you something. Umm, Iâve been thinking, Iâm just gonna come out and say it. Okay? I-I-I ah, I-I think I love you.

Emily: Oh. (Sheâs shocked and hugs him.) Thank you. (She boards the plane.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Rachel is singing some kind of song.]

Rachel: Whatâs that song? It has been in my head all day long.

Chandler: Itâs the theme from Good Will Humping.

Rachel: Yâknow who doesnât even like dirty movies? My new boyfriend Joshua.

Joey: Yeah right.

Rachel: No, he told me. He prefers to leave certain things to the imagination.

Chandler: Oh-oh, yeah, and did he also say that ah, some of the dialogue was corny and that he actually found it was funny and not sexy?

Rachel: Yes!

Joey: Yeah, he likes porn.

(Rachel starts to leave.)

Monica: Where ya going?

Rachel: Iâm going to find out if he really thinks supermodels are too skinny. (As she exits, Phoebe enters.) Hey, Pheebs!

Phoebe: Hey.

Joey: Hey!

Monica: How did it go with Frank and Alice?

Phoebe: Well, Frank has to quit college because his super fertile sister is having three babies! I need to make a lot of money really fast, and I had an idea that I want to talk to you (Points to Chandler) about, âcause you work for a big company. Okay, insider trading, what information is there that you can give me.

Chandler: They donât really talk to us about that kind of stuff. I can get you some free white out though.

(Ross enters.)

Monica: Ohh! Did you do what I said? Did-did-did you tell her?

Ross: I did.

Monica: And well, what did she say?

Ross: Thank you.

Monica: Oh, youâre totally welcome! Whatâd she say?

Ross: She said, "Thank you." I said, "I love you." And she said, "Thank you."

Chandler: Whoa-whoa, wait a minute, did you say, you love her?

Joey: Yeah, what were you trying to get her to do?!

Ross: What do I do now?

Joey: You play hard to get.

Ross: She already lives in London.

Joey: Then you go to Tokyo.

Chandler: All right look, forget it, forget it. You told her you love her, itâs over.

Monica: It is not over! Youâre over!

Chandler: What?

Monica: You know!

Chandler: Okay. (Pause) Good one.

Monica: It is not over because she is going to call you and tell you she loves you. And the reason why she couldnât, is because her feelings were so strong, it scared her. Now you go home and wait for her call, she could be calling you from the plane! Come on now go! Go! (Tries to push Ross out the door.)

Ross: Okay! Okay! But if she doesnât call, it is definitely over! No, wait. Wait. Unless, eventually, I call her, yâknow just to she whatâs going on, and, and she says sheâll call me back, but then she doesnât. Then itâs over.

(Joey holds his fist up, and Chandler gives him two thumbs up.)

Joey: Way to be strong, man!

(Ross leaves, and after the door closes, Joey gives him the loser sign.)

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Joey enter having just woken up.]

Rachel: Hey!

Chandler: Hi! Listen, can we watch cartoons on your television? We need a porn break. We spent the last two hours watching In & Out & In, Again.

Rachel: Well, so, why donât you just turn it off?

Chandler: Because then we would be the guys who turned off free porn.

Phoebe: (entering carrying a case) Ooh, good, youâre hear! Okay.

Monica: Hey!

Phoebe: Hi!

Rachel: Well, what-what âcha got there?

Phoebe: Oh this, well Iâm glad you asked. (She opens the case and removes a knife and an soda can.) Now, donât you hate it when you have to cut a tin can with an ordinary steak knife? (She efficiently cuts it in half.) Ahh! Now, I know what youâre thinkingâ¦

Chandler: Pregnant Woman Slays Four?

Monica: Phoebe, they didnât make you pay for those knives, did they?

Phoebe: No!

Monica: Are you sure?

Phoebe: No!

Rachel: Honey, youâre not gonna make enough money to help Frank and Alice just by selling knives.

Phoebe: No-no, I know that, but I just have to make enough money for the second part of my plan.

Chandler: Whatâs the second part of your plan?

Phoebe: My Saturn dealership.

[Scene: Rossâs bedroom, he has fallen asleep waiting for Emily to call. He is awaken by the phone.]

Ross: (Answers the phone.) Hello?

Emily: Ross.

Ross: Emily, hi! Uh, how-how was you flight?

Emily: It was dreadful. I felt terrible about how I acted when you said those wonderful things.

Ross: No, no, that-that, thatâs all right. Umm, Iâm just glad you called.

Emily: Ross umm, thereâs something that Iâve got to tell you, thereâs-thereâs someone else.

Ross: Does that mean the same thing in England as it does in America?

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Ross is relating his recent conversation with Emily to the gang.]

Ross: She doesnât know which one of us she wants, me or this Colin guy.

Monica: This isnât how itâs supposed to go, there canât be another guy.

Ross: Wellâ¦

Monica: Of course thereâs another guy!! This is even more perfect! Now you have to prove your love!

Ross: Iâm not proving anything. Okay, Iâm done listening to you. If I hadnât let you talk me into going to the airport in the first place, I never wouldâve put my fist through the wall!

Chandler: You put your fist through the wall?

Ross: No, I missed and hit the door. But, it opened really hard!

Monica: You have to go to London!

Ross: What?

Monica: Yeah, you have to go fight for her!

Joey: Oh yeah, sure, that makes sense. Yeah. âCause you already told her you love her and she didnât say it back, then she called you and told you that thereâs another guy, so yeah, go to London thatâll scare her!

Monica: When Rachel was with Paulo, what did you do?

Ross: I made fun of his accent.

Monica: You sat back and let him have her, you didnât fight at all. Am I right? Do you want the same thing to happen with Emily?

Ross: No.

Monica: All right then, go fight for her! Go to London! I mean, that could be you and Emily! (Points to the TV.) That, but-but nicer. Just, go to London!

Ross: Really?

Monica: Come on! Surprise her! Show up at her doorstep! Donât let her go without a fight!

Ross: All right. All right, Iâm gonna do it!

Monica: All right.

Ross: Iâm gonna, Iâm gonna go to London and Iâm going to fight for her.

Monica: Okay, good luck!

(Ross starts to leave.)

Joey: Ross! Ross! If youâre going to the airport, could you pick me up another one of those Toblerone bars? (Chandler nods his head no.)

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica, Joey, and Chandler are sitting and talking as Phoebe and Rachel enter.]

Rachel: Hey!

Phoebe: Ooh-Ooh! I did it! I did it! I figured out a way to make money! Iâm gonna open up my own massage place and Frankâs gonna help me! And! We can work it around his schedule so he doesnât have to quit school!

Monica: Thatâs sounds great, but how are you going to afford it?

Rachel: Well, we were walking down the street and we saw that van that you guys used for catering and we realisedâ¦

Phoebe: Iâm telling it! Iâm telling it!

Rachel: Okay.

Phoebe: Okay. You know how people need transportation, but they also need massages to help them relax so I just figured we could combine the two, okay, I give the massages and Frank drives! I can fix up the van, bolt the table in the back, and you know what Iâve got?

Chandler: A place where no one will ever get out alive?

Phoebe: No! Think about it, itâs a taxi that people take when they need to relax, itâsâ¦

Rachel: (interrupting) Relaxi-Taxi!

Phoebe: The name was my favourite part!

Rachel: Well, well I can up with it!

Phoebe: YOU DID NOT!!!! Oh! No! You came up with Relaxi Cab! Thatâs not good.

Rachel: Well, Iâ¦

(The phone rings and Monica answers it.)

Monica: Hello.

Ross: (on phone) Hey.

Monica: Oh my God! Ross, are you in England? Was Emily surprised?

[Cut to Ross in one of those British phone booths.]

Ross: No, because she hasnât come home yet. And she hasnât been home all night! Sheâs obviously staying with that other guy, and Iâm the stupid moron who spent the whole night outside her apartment!

Monica: All right. When is, when is the next flight out?

Ross: About four hours.

Monica: Okay, just stay there a couple more hours and if she doesnât show up by then, then just come on home.

Phoebe: Hey, tell him about Relaxi-Taxi, and-and ask him if he thinks thatâs better than Relaxi Cab.

Rachel: Okay, itâs not Relaxi Cab. Itâs Relaxicab, like taxicab.

Phoebe: Oh, that is better.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, later that same night. There is a knock on the door and Chandler answers it to reveal Emily standing behind it.]

Chandler: Are we in London?

Monica: What are you doing here? You canât be here!

Emily: Iâve uh, Iâve come to talk to Ross.

(She sets her bag down on the foosball table and Joey sees the Toblerone bar sticking out of it and gazes longingly at it.)

Emily: What?

Joey: (pause) Nothing. No, nothing.

Emily: I was going to call him, butâ¦

Monica: Oh, you came to tell him you love him! I knew it! (Points at Chandler) I was right! (Points to Emily) Iâm right, right?

Emily: Iâd really rather talk to him.

Monica: Oh.

Emily: I uh, Iâve been to his apartment and he wasnât there, and uh. I need to talk to him, so do you have any idea where he is?

[Cut to London, we sit Ross sitting outside Emilyâs apartment. We hear Emilyâs phone ring with amazing clarity. Apparently, sound travels quite easily through the walls of British buildings. Anyhoo, Ross looks around for the ringing phone and in the meantime Emilyâs answering machine picks up and once again with amazing clarity we hear Emily sayâ¦]

Emily: Ross, are you there? Ross, I donât know if you can hear this butâ¦ (Ross has moved to the window, apparently so that he can hear better.) Iâm gonna talk anyway, uh, Iâm in the States with you sister and your friends and itâs all over with Colin. I came here to tell you that, and to tell youâYes, Joey you can have all the chocolate you want, just take it! Uh, I came here to tell you that I love you.

Ross: (yelling, thinking Emily can hear him through the answering machine all the way to New York.) I love you too! Iâm, Iâm gonna call you right now from the phone booth! (Realises) You canât hear me. (Goes to make his call.)

Emily: I wish I could know if youâd heard any of that. I suppose Iâve either just told you I love you or given my neighbours a good laugh. Mrs. Newman if youâre listening, bugger off this in none of your business. I suppose thereâs not much chance you did heard that, and thereâs the call waiting so, I should go. Oh well. (Answers the call waiting.) Hello.

Ross: Hi.

Emily: Ross, I love you!

Ross: Ohh! Thank you.

Phoebe: (not amused) Ha-ha. (She sits down on the couch.) No, itâs just Iâm so pregnant that Iâmy guitar doesnât fit anymore. So I thought âtil Iâm not, Iâm just gonna play all my songs on this drum. It sounds really cool!

Chandler: All right.

Phoebe: Listen. Listen. (She starts to play and sing.) Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?

Phoebe: Oh, well, donât tell me you want to keep more of your stuff in my uterus.

Alice: (laughs) No. No. No. (Sits down.) Okay, now, see, I wanna name the girl baby Leslie, and Frank wants to name one of the boy babies Frank JR. JR.

Chandler: Wouldnât that be Frank the III?

Alice: Donât get me started. (To Phoebe) Anyway, umm, since there are three babies and umm, we both got to put our names in, we would be truly honoured if you named the other boy baby.

Phoebe: Wow! Thatâs so great! Oh! Oh! Cougar.

Alice: You think about it. (Leaves)

Opening Credits

[Scene: Rossâs apartment, he and Emily are getting ready to go to the airport.]

Emily: I left a bra drying on the shower rod, you donât think your son will think itâs yours and be horribly traumatised?

Ross: Hey, if mommy can have a wife, daddy can have a bra.

Emily: (checks the clock) Ohh, itâs time to go.

Ross: Oh, no-no-no, see, that-that clockâs a little fast, uh, we have 17 minutes. Huh, what can we do in 17 minutes? Twice?

Emily: Well thatâs ambitious.

(They kiss but are interrupted by a knock on the door.)

Ross: Hey, uh, you can ignore that.

Emily: Thatâs Carol with your son!

Ross: Uhh, believe me when heâs older, heâll understand.

Carol: (knocking on the door) Ross!

Ross: Iâll be right there. (He goes over and opens the door to Carol, Susan, and Ben.) (To Ben.) Hello! (To Carol.) Hello! (To Susan.) Hey. Uhh, Emily, this is Carol and Susan.

Susan: Hey, itâs so nice to finally meet you!

Emily: Me too!

Carol: Ohh, yâknow, Susanâs gonna be shooting a commercial in London next week.

Susan: Oh yeah, Iâm so excited, Iâve never been there.

Emily: Oh, well, Iâll show you around.

Susan: That would be great! Also, uh, I was hoping to catch a show so if you can make any suggestionsâ¦

Emily: Oh, thereâs tonnes of terrific stuffâIâll go with you!

Susan: Ahh!

(Ross accidentally, on purpose, bumps into Susan.)

Ross: Look at you two, bonding, making us late for the airport soâ¦

Emily: Are you all right?

Susan: Oh, heâs fine. Heâs fine. Itâs just that us getting along is difficult for him, because he doesnât like me.

Ross: Oh come on! Thatâs-thatâsâ¦ true.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are playing foosball as Phoebe enters.]

Phoebe: Hi!

Joey: Hey!

Chandler: Hey! Do we have a baby name yet?

Phoebe: Ugh! No! This is so hard! I went through this whole book (Holds up a book) and found nothing! I want a name thatâs really like, yâknow strong and confident, yâknow? Like-like Exxon.

Chandler: Well, it certainly worked for that Valdez kid.

Joey: Ooh-ooh, Pheebs, you want a strong name? How about, The Hulk?

Phoebe: No, Iâm-Iâm not sure about Hulk, but I like the idea of a name starting with "The."

Joey: Oh, want a good name, go with Joey. Joeyâs your pal. Joeyâs your buddy. "Where is everybody?" "Well, theyâre hanging out with Joey."

Chandler: Hey, yâknow what, if youâre gonna do that, if youâre gonna name him Joey, you should name him Chandler. (Phoebe doesnât think so.) Oh, come on! Chandlerâs funny, sophisticated, and heâs very loveable, once you get to know him.

Joey: Oh well, hey, Joeyâs loveable too! But the thing about Joey is, if you need him, heâll be there.

Chandler: Well, Chandler will be there for you too. I mean, well, he might be a little late, but-but, heâll be there. And heâll bring you some cold soda, if want you need him for is that youâre really hot.

Joey: What do ya say? What do ya say?

Phoebe: Well, I, I like the idea of naming him after someone I love, and Joey and Chandler are great names. (They both stare at her.) But, all right, I donâtâmaybe Iâll just name him The Hulk.

Joey: I knew I shouldnât have mentioned it! Thatâs what I wanted to name my kid!

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Monica is cooking and Rachel is getting ready for a date with Joshua.]

Rachel: Hey, Mon, if you were hoping to sleep with Joshua the first time tonight, which one of these would you want to be wearing. (Sheâs holding two frilly, lace nighties.)

Monica: Yâknow what? It really creeps me out choosing other peopleâs sex clothes.

Rachel: Sorry. Iâm so exited! Iâve been waiting for this for months! I got my hair coloured! I got new sheets! Iâm making him a very fancy meal.

Monica: Um-hmm.

Rachel: What am I making him by the way?

Monica: Well, youâre making him a frieze salad with goat cheese and pine nuts, wild nuts, wild rice, roast asparagus, and salmon au croup.

Rachel: I thought I was making him filet mignon?

Monica: Yeah, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant. And then you realised if you (Points at Rachel) bitched about it, then you (Points to herself) would stop cooking, and you (Points at Rachel) would have to make your famous baked potato and Diet Coke.

Rachel: Wow, I really get crabby when I cook.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Joey, Chandler, and Phoebe are there as Ross enters.]

Ross: Hey!

Joey: Hey!

Chandler: Hey!

Ross: So uh, Emily called last nightâ¦

Chandler: And now youâre giving me the message!

Ross: Turns out them Emily is just crazy about Susan. Yeah, theyâre going to the theatre together! Theyâre going to dinner! Theyâre going horseback riding!

Phoebe: God, Susan is so fun!

Ross: Look, this is just a little too familiar, okay? For like, for like six months before Carol and I spilt up, all I heard was: "My friend Susan is so smart. My friend Susan is so funny. My friend Susan is so great."

Chandler: You actually think that something can happen between Emily and Susan?

Ross: Hey, theyâre going to the gym together! Two women! Stretching! Yâknow they-they take a steam together! Things get a little playfulâdidnât you see Personal Best?

Joey: No, but Iâm gonna!

Chandler: Hi! Hi! Youâre crazy! Okay? This is Emily. Emily is straight.

Ross: How do you know? I mean we thought Carol was straight before I married her!

Phoebe: Yeah, I definitely. I donât like the name Ross.

Ross: What a weird way to kick me when Iâm down.

Phoebe: No! No! I-I meant for the baby!

Ross: Oh. Whatâs wrong with Ross?

Phoebe: Well, itâs just yâknow that something like this would never to like The Hulk, yâknowâ¦

Ross: Actually that-thatâs not true, in The Incredible Hulk uh, No. 72, Dr. Bruce Banner foundâ¦ (Sees everyone staring at him and stops.) Yâknow, ugh, nevermind, my girlfriendâs a lesbian. (Leaves.)

Phoebe: So, I decided Iâm definitely going to go with either Joey or Chandler.

Joey: Oh! Oh-oh, you gotta pick Joey! I mean, name one famous person named Chandler.

Chandler: Raymond Chandler.

Joey: Someone you didnât make up!

Chandler: Okay, there are no famous Joeyâs. Except for, huh, Joey Buttafucco.

Joey: Yeah, that guy really hurt us.

Phoebe: Well, how about a compromise then, okay? What if itâs like yâknow, Chanoey?

Chandler: Okay, look, Joey! Come on, think about it, first of all, heâll never be President. Thereâs never gonna be a President Joey.

Joey: All right look man, I didnât want to bring this up, but Chandler, is the stupidest name I ever heard in my life! Itâs not even a name; itâs barely even a word. Okay? Itâs kinda like chandelier, but itâs not! All right? Itâs a stupid, stupid non-name!

Chandler: Wow, youâre, youâre right. I have a horrible, horrible name.

Joey: Iâm sorry man, I didnâtâIâm-Iâm sorry. Iâm sorry. (Goes over and comforts him.)

Chandler: Okay.

Joey: So I guess itâs Joey then!

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's erm, Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is on her dinner date with Joshua.]

Joshua: This is so nice. Thank you for doing this.

Rachel: Ohh, please! Cooking soothes me. (They kiss.) Ahh. So, dig in!

Joshua: Great! Oh, it all looks sooo good!

Rachel: (taking a bite) Hmmm!

Joshua: Oh my God!

Rachel: Oh I know, my God, this is soâthis rice is soâI am so good.

Joshua: Behind you?

Rachel: (sees the chick and the duck) Oh, yeah, Iâm sorry. They used to live here; sometimes they migrate back over.

Joshua: (getting up and backing away from they.) Is there ah, is there some way they can not be here. Itâs just ah, farm birds really kinda freak me out!

Rachel: Yeah, sure, okay. Okay.

(Rachel gets up and ushers them into the hall, as they pass Joshua, he leaps onto the counter to avoid them. Rachel drops them off in the hall, and knocks on Joeyâs door.)

Joey: (answering the door.) Hey, how did you do that?! Come on in. (He brings them inside.)

[Cut back to Rachelâs date.]

Rachel: All gone! So, farm birds, huh?

Joshua: Yeah, itâs-itâs my only weird thing, I swear. And I-I-I wouldâve told you about it, but I didnât know they would be here.

Rachel: Oh.

Joshua: So, all right.

(They both sit back down.)

Rachel: Okay. So, can I serve you a little ofâWhat? What? What? (She sees that Joshua isnât relaxed.)

Joshua: Nothing I uh, itâs just that I know that theyâre still out there.

Rachel: But, theyâre across the hall! I mean thatâs two doors away, it would take them a long time to peck their way back over here.

Joshua: Okay, thatâs-thatâs not funny. Uhh.

Rachel: Okay, yâknow, would you feel better if we went someplace else? I mean we could pack all this stuff up and yâknow go to your apartment.

Joshua: Oh, theyâre working on this week, itâs a total mess. But uh, Iâm staying at my parentsâ house, we could go there.

Rachel: Your parentsâ?

Joshua: Yeah, theyâre out of town.

Rachel: Ohh.

Joshua: Yeah-yeah, itâs this huge place, and-and itâs got this gorgeous view of the park, and very, very romantic. What do you say?

Rachel: Yeah that works.

(He moves to kiss her, but stops when he hears the duck.)

Joshua: They-they-they can smell fear.

[Scene: Rossâs apartment, Carol has come to pick up Ben.]

Ross: (opening the door.) Hey!

Carol: Hey! Howâs Ben?

Ross: Well, I asked him if he wanted to eat, he said, "No." I asked him if he wanted to sleep, he said, "No." I asked him what he wanted to do, he said, "No." So, heâs sweeping. (We see Ben playing with a broom and a dustpan.)

Carol: Hey, Ben! Hey!

Ross: So umm, any word from Susan?

Carol: Ooh, yeah! She said sheâs having sooo much fun with Emily.

Ross: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh, by the by, did it uh, did it ever occur to you that, I donât know, maybe they might be having a little too much fun?

Carol: Whatâs too much fun?

Ross: Yâknow, the kind of fun, you and Susan had when we were married.

Carol: Oh my God, you are so paranoid!

Ross: Am I?!

Carol: Yes!

Ross: Am I?!

Carol: I canât speak for Emily, but Susan is in a loving, committed relationship.

Ross: Uh-huh, Carol, so were we. All right, just-just imagine for a moment, Susan meets someone and-and they really hit it off. Yâknow? Say-say theyâre coming back from the theatre, and they-they stop at a pub for a couple of drinks, theyâre laughing, yâknow, someone innocently touches someone elseâ¦ Thereâs electricity, itâs new. Itâs exciting. Are you telling me there isnât even the slightest possibility of something happening?

Carol: Maybe.

Ross: OH MY GOD!! I didnât really believe it until you just said it!!

[Scene: Joshuaâs parentsâ apartment, Rachel and Joshua are entering.]

Joshua: â¦and even though none of the other kids believed me, I swear to God, that duck pushed me!

Rachel: Wow! This place is fabulous!

Joshua: Yeah, yeah, let me show you around. This is the uh, downstairs living room.

Rachel: Whoa-whoa, thereâs two living rooms? God, growing up here, this place mustâve been a real babe magnet.

Joshua: Yeah, well, it wouldâve been, but uh, my parents just moved here.

Rachel: Ohh, you should know, this place is a real babe magnet. Wanna make out?

(They kiss.)

Joshua: Hey, hereâs an idea. Why donât uh, I put the food in the fridge and we can eat it later?

Rachel: That sounds like a plan. Umm, is there a place I can go freshen up?

Joshua: Oh yeah, yeah uh, itâs down the hall and uh, second door to your left.

Rachel: Ah.

(She goes down the hall. Joshua goes to put the food away when his parents walk in.)

Mrs. Burgin: Oh, hi, darling!

Joshua: Mom, Dad, what are you guys doing here?

Mrs. Burgin: Oh, well we cut the trip short.

Mr. Burgin: France sucks!

Joshua: Umm, this may be a little weird, but I-I-I got a date here.

Mrs. Burgin: Oh, say no more!

Mr. Burgin: Weâll just grab some food and take it with us right upstairs, and weâll be right out of you hair.

Joshua: Oh, that-that would be great. So you didnât even get to Italy?

Mr. Burgin: Yep, sucks!

(They all go into the kitchen. Just then, Rachel comes back from the bathroom; she had removed her dress and is wearing nothing but a lace nightie. She tries to find someplace seductive to wait for Joshua. She tries to sit on the piano, but it makes too much noise. So she goes over to the couch and kinda half lays down to wait for Joshua. Joshua comes in from the kitchen, sees Rachel, and freezes.)

Rachel: Hi you!

Joshua: Oh my God!

Rachel: I know, I can do more than cook.

(Just then, his parents enter. Rachel gasps.)

Mr. Burgin: I like her. She sees smart.

Commercial Break

Joshua: Uhh, Rachel, my parentsâ¦

Rachel: Ohh! Itâs so nice to meet you. (She goes over and shakes their hands.) Hello.

Mr. Burgin: Hi.

Rachel: Hello.

Mrs. Burgin: Hello. Well, Joshua, that $500 was for groceries.

Rachel: What? This-this, no, oh no, no-no-no, this is notâthatâs-thatâs not what it is. See, see, okay, I work in fashion, see and-and, this is a real dress actually. Itâs-itâs, theyâre-theyâre wearing it in Milan, so part of my job is too wear the clothes, and then I see how people respond, and then I report back to my superiors at Bloomingdaleâs, soâ¦ And obviously in uh, in-in this case, (She grabs a pen and paper) I am going to report back, "USA not ready."

Mrs. Burgin: Maybe in L.A?

Rachel: Yes!

Joshua: There you go.

Mr. Burgin: So, have you kids eaten yet?

Rachel: Well, we were going to do that afterâI mean umm, next.

Mr. Burgin: Well, weâre starving, why donât we all go get something to eat?

Rachel: Oh, yeah, wellâ¦ Yeah, no use wasting this baby, just lyinâ around the house.

Mr. Burgin: Soâ¦ We go eat.

Rachel: Yes.

Mr. Burgin: Youâll wear that. Weâll be eating, and of course, youâll be wearing that.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is looking for a new name in Phoebeâs book of names.]

Joey: Dude, I am sorry about what I said!

Chandler: No, no, youâre right, it is a ridiculous name!

Joey: Itâs not that bad.

Chandler: Yes it is! From now on, I have no first name.

Joey: So, youâre just Bing?

Chandler: I have no name.

Phoebe: All right, so, what are we supposed to call you?

Chandler: Okay uh, for now, temporarily, you can call me, Clint.

Joey: No way are you cool enough to pull of Clint.

Chandler: Okay, so what name am I cool enough to pull off?

Phoebe: Umm, Gene.

Chandler: Itâs Clint. Itâs Clint! (He heads for his bedroom.)

Joey: See you later, Gene.

Phoebe: Bye, Gene.

Chandler: Itâs Clint! Clint!

Joey: Whatâs up with Gene?

[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is telling Phoebe and Monica of her date.]

Monica: So, you wore your nightie to dinner?

Rachel: Oh, yeah. And uh, the best part though, when the uh, waiter spilled water down my back, I jumped up, and my boob popped out.

Phoebe: Oh my God!

Monica: Oh, no!

Rachel: No, itâs all right. I got nice boobs. (Phoebe and Monica nod there heads in agreement.)

Ross: (returning from the phone.) So, I just picked up a message from Emily, she and Susan are going to a poetry reading together!

Rachel: So?

Ross: So! Poetry? Susanâs gay! Theyâre being gay together!

Monica: Emilyâs straight.

Ross: Oh, wake up!

Phoebe: Wow, Carol really messed you up!

Ross: Excuse me?

Phoebe: Yeah, she turned you into this-this-this untrusting, crazy, jealous, sycophant. (They all look at her.) All right, so I donât know what sycophant means, but the rest is right.

Ross: Look, I donât know what youâre talking about, I am not a crazy, jealous person.

Rachel: Huh.

Ross: What?

Rachel: Sheâs totally right! When we were together, you got all freaked out about Mark and there was nothing going on.

Monica: This totally makes sense!

Ross: It does not!

Monica: Oh, sure it does! In high school, you werenât jealous at all even though all your girlfriends were cheating on you!

Phoebe: All right, all right, so up until â92-93 he was very trusting, then â94 hit, Carol left him and bamn! Paranoid city!

Rachel: Absolutely! Absolutely!

Monica: This is so much fun!

Ross: This is not fun!

Monica: Look, all weâre trying to say is, donât let what happened with Carol ruin what you got with Emily.

Phoebe: Yeah. The â92 Ross wouldnât.

Ross: Well, I still think I was right about that whole Mark thing.

Rachel: Whatâyeahâwhat, yâknow what? I hope Emily is a lesbian.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, Phoebe is showing off more of her drum skills to Joey by rubbing one of the sticks back and forth across the drum.]

Phoebe: Drum roll.

Chandler: (entering) Okay. Okay. All right. Help! Am I a Mark, or a John?

Joey: Nah, youâre not tall enough to be a Mark, but you might make a good Barney.

Chandler: All right look, am I serious, okay? Tomorrow at 3:30 I am going down to the courthouse.

Phoebe: Youâre actually going through with this?

Chandler: Hey, look, this name has been holding me back my entire life. Okay, itâs probably why kids picked on me in school, and why I never do well with womenâ¦ So, as of 4 oâclock tomorrow, Iâm either gonna be Mark Johnson or John Markson.

Phoebe: You got problems because of you! Not your name! All right, this has got to stop! Chandler is a great name! In factâyes, (To Joey) Iâm, Iâm sorry. I know you really wanted me to name the baby Joey, but eh, so, Iâm-Iâm, Iâm gonna, Iâm gonna name the baby Chandler.

Chandler: (pleased) Really?!

Phoebe: Yeah, but you have to keep the name too!

Chandler: Okay. Thanks.

Phoebe: Okay!

Chandler: You wanna hug it out?

Phoebe: Yeah!

(They both hug.)

Phoebe: Yay!

Chandler: Yay!

Phoebe: Yayâohâyay! Okay, I gotta go tell Frank and Alice! Right now!

Chandler: Okay!

Phoebe: Ooh, uhâ¦ (She grabs her coat and runs out.)

Chandler: Bye, Pheebs!

Phoebe: Okay, bye!

Chandler: Ha! Ha! Ha!

Joey: Ohh! (Realises it was all a trick to get Phoebe to name the baby Chandler.)

Rachel: Stop it! I will kill you. I hate the fact that my room is so small.

Monica: Hey, I have all the space I need. Just do what I did.

Rachel: Monica, you donât even have a bed, you sleep in a ball on the floor!

Monica: Yâknow what? I am really tired of your bellyaching! Okay, I-I worked really hard at making this a nice place for us to live!

Rachel: Iâm sorry. Iâm so sorry.

Monica: Okay.

Joey: See, this is a great apartment.

Phoebe: (entering, wearing Santa pants) Hello!

Chandler: Ho! Ho! Ho!

Phoebe: Excuse me.

Chandler: Your pants!

Phoebe: Oh, yeah! You like âem? I just, I went to a used clothes store and got a bunch of maternity stuff. These are sooo comfortable!

Joey: Uhh, Pheebs, those are uh, those are Santa pants.

Phoebe: What?

Chandler: Santa pants. (Phoebe still doesnât get it.) Santa Clausâs pants.

Phoebe: Nuh-uh! Theyâre maternity pants. They even came with a list of baby names. (Pulls out a sheet of paper which lists whoâs been naughty and whoâs been nice.) See, these names are good, and these names are bad. (Finally, she figures it out.) Ohh.

Rachel: (entering) Hey!

Monica: (entering) Hey!

Rachel: SoâHey, Pheebs! So, how are the elves?

Phoebe: I donât know! How are the-the-the-the, yâknowâYouâre clothes arenât funny.

Monica: Hey, guys, what-what should I wear to a Knicks game?

Chandler: Uhh, a T-shirt that says, "I donât belong here."

Joey: You have Knicks tickets?

Rachel: Yeah, my mom got my dadâs season tickets in the divorce, so she just gave them to me.

Monica: Yeah, apparently, theyâre pretty good seats.

Rachel: Yeah.

Joey: (examining the tickets) Oh my God! Those are almost right on the floor!

Rachel: Do you guys want these?

Joey: Yeah!

Chandler: Yeah we do!

Rachel: Ohh, well you got âem.

Both: All right!

Rachel: Just give us our apartment back!

Phoebe: Boy! I didnât see that coming!

Chandler: Are you serious?

Rachel: Oh, come on! We know what these are worth.

Monica: Yeah, what, do you think weâre stupid?

Joey: Youâre not stupid. Youâre meaner than I thought.

Monica: What do you say?

Chandler: Forget it! Okay, Iâm not giving up my bachelor pad for some basketball seats!

Rachel: Youâre bachelor pad?!

Monica: Have you even had a girl up here?

Chandler: No. But uh, Joey has, and I usually talk to them in the morning time.

Joey: Yeah, you do!

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is whining to Chandler about the tickets.]

Joey: Come on!

Chandler: (ignoring him) Yes, Gunther, can I get two cups of chino, please?

Gunther: Good one.

Joey: Come on, season tickets! Season tickets, do you know what that means?

Chandler: Forget it! Okay, Iâm not giving up the apartment.

Joey: Oh comeâlook, when I was a kid my dadâs company gave season tickets to the number one salesman every year, all right? My dad never won! Of course, he wasnât in the sales division, but still, I never ever, ever forgot that!

Ross: (entering) Hey, guys! (They both notice his new little friend)

Joey: Hey!

Chandler: Oh my God!

Joey: We donât make enough fun of you already?

Ross: Oh yeah, Emily convinced me to do it.

Chandler: You do know that Wham broke up?

Ross: I like it, and Emily likes it, and thatâs what counts. So uh, how are you guys doing?

Joey: Oh-no, donât try and talk all normal with that thing in your ear.

Chandler: Where is Emily?

Ross: Ugh, sheâs saying good-bye to her uncle.

Chandler: Man, didnât she like just get here?

Ross: Yeah!! Yeah!

Chandler: Easy tiger.

Ross: I just, I hate this so much! I mean, every time I go pick her up at the airport, itâs-itâs so great. But at the same time Iâm thinking, "Well, Iâm gonna be right back there in a couple of days, dropping her off."

Chandler: So what are you going to do?

Ross: Nothing! Thereâs nothing to do! I mean, she lives there, I live here. I mean, she-sheâd have to uh, move here. She should move here!

Joey: What?

Ross: I could ask her to live with me!

Chandler: Are you serious?

Ross: I mean, why not! I mean, I mean why not?!

Chandler: Because youâve only known her for six weeks! Okay, Iâve got a carton of milk in my fridge Iâve had a longer relationship with!

Ross: Look guys, when Iâm with her itâs-itâs-itâs like she brings this-this-this great side out of me. I mean I-I-I love her, yâknow?

Chandler: And I love the milk! But, Iâm not gonna some British girl to move in with me! (Realizes that made no sense.) Joey, you say things now.

Joey: All right look, Ross, heâs right. Emilyâs great, sheâs great! But this way too soon, youâre only gonna scare her!

Ross: I donât want to do that.

Joey: No! You donât want to wreck it, you donât want to go to fast!

Ross: Yeah, no, youâre right, I know, youâre right, Iâm not, Iâm not gonna do it. All right, thanks guys. (Gets up to leave.)

Chandler: Okay, no problem, just remember to wake us up before you go-go.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's erm, Chandler and Joey's, later that same day. Joey and Chandler are eating pizza, and Phoebe is trying to knit something.]

Phoebe: Thatâs too hard. Too hard!

Monica: (entering with Rachel) All right boys, last chance for the tickets!

Rachel: Or Iâll give them to my new boyfriend, Joshua.

Chandler: No thank you.

Joey: Wait-wait-wait-wait! (To Chandler) Come on! Come on, letâs trade! The timingâs perfect, I just clogged the toilet!

Chandler: Look, I want those basketball seats as much as you do! Okay, but we canât leave in the small apartment after weâve lived here! Didnât you ever read Flowers for Algernon?

Joey: Yes! Didnât you ever read Sports Illustrated?! No! I didnât read yours! But come on, we can go to the game tonight!

Chandler: Look, the only way I will even consider this is if they offer a lot more than just season seats.

Joey: Itâs the Knicks!

Chandler: Screw the Knicks!

Joey: Whoa!

Chandler: I didnât mean that. I just meant that the apartment is worth so much more.

Joey: Huh.

Chandler: And the Knicks rule all.

Joey: Yeah, the Knicks rule all!

Phoebe: Hey, so? Are you gonna do it?

Chandler: No. No. Weâre not gonna do that, yâknow why? Because its not an even trade.

Rachel: All right, okay, look, what if you could keep the apartment and get the tickets?

Joey: Done!

Rachel: Let me finish.

Joey: Oh.

Rachel: Iâm talking about a bet, winner takes all.

Joey: Ooh, we could end up with nothing.

Phoebe: Or you could end up with everything.

Joey: Ooh, I like that.

Monica: All right, so what do you say?

Chandler: No!

Monica: Oh, just do it!!

Chandler: Op, op, Iâm convinced!

Joey: Come on man, you know Iâd do it for you! Because, youâre my best friend.

Chandler: All right, but you canât use that again for a whole year. Iâm in.

Joey: All right!

Phoebe: Ooh, this is so exciting! Ooh, God, what are you going to bet?

Rachel: Oh, okay, well, I think we should let Phoebe decide, because sheâs the only whoâs impartial, and sheâs so pretty.

Phoebe: Okay. Umm, ooh, oohâoh, I have a game!

Joey: Okay!

Chandler: Okay!

Phoebe: This is great!

Joey: Whatâs the game?! Whatâs the game?!

Phoebe: Oh, well, it doesnât have a nameâoh, okay, Phoebeball! No, it doesnât have a name. Umm, okay, Monica, what is your favourite thing about trees?

Monica: Theyâre green?

Phoebe: Good! Good! Five points!

(They both rejoice; Chandler is totally confused.)

Phoebe: All right, Joey, same question.

(He looks to Chandler, who doesnât have a clue.)

Joey: Uhh, theyâre tall.

Phoebe: Ooh, three points. Both fine answers, but we were looking for leafy, leafy.

(Joey turns and is angry that Chandler didnât come up with the answer.)

Monica: Thatâs not even a game!

Rachel: What? Shut up! Weâre winning!

Monica: You wanna finish this right now? All right, we get a deck of cards, high card wins. What do you say?

Chandler: Fine, letâs do it.

Phoebe: Oh, I have cards!

Joey: Oh.

Monica: Oh, good.

Phoebe: Yeah! Here! (She grabs a deck out of her purse) Oh no, these are the trick deck. Okay. Here yes. Okay.

Chandler: Okay, you guys uh, you guys pick first

Rachel: Okay.

Monica: Okay. (She picks a card.) Four.

Chandler: Thatâs a low one!

Joey: Yeah! Okay. (Joey picks a card.) Phoebe, you look, I canât.

Phoebe: What make you think I can?! (Shields her eyes from it.)

Joey: Okay. Okay. (He looks at the card.) Ace!

(Both Joey and Chandler and Monica and Rachel jump up and down for joy.)

Chandler: Why are you screaming and hugging?

Monica: Because we won our apartment back!

Joey: What? Ace is high! Jack, queen, king, ace!

Monica: No! Ace is low! Ace, two, three, four!

(They all look to Phoebe to settle this.)

Phoebe: I donât know. Ooh! Ooh! Look it! (She fans out the trick deck.) Ah-ha!

Rachel: All right, cut, letâs pick again, pick again.

Joey: Okay.

Rachel: Come on apartment! Come on apartment! (Picks a card.) Oh! I know queen is high!

Joey: Uh-huh, not as high asâ¦(picks a card) It worked! King!

Chandler: Yeah baby!

Monica: But, we pick again! We pick again!

Joey: Why?!

Monica: I donât know!

Chandler: Tickets please! (Rachel hands over the tickets) Thatâs courtside baby!

Joey: Seriously, good game though. Good game. (He tries to congratulate them, but they pull away.) (To Chandler) What are they so mad about? They get the apartment back!

Chandler: No they didnât!

[Scene: Rossâs apartment, Emily has packed as Ross returns.]

Ross: Hey!

Emily: I packed while you were gone. I left some knickers under your pillow.

Ross: (laughs) Move in with me.

Emily: What?!

Ross: Donât be scared, I-I know it sounds crazy and-and people will say itâs too soon, but just-just think, think how great it will be.

Emily: Ohh, no. Ugh. Oh, leaving London, my whole family lives there.

Ross: I know.

Emily: My job!

Ross: Well, so, you-youâll get a job here! I mean, Iâm always hearing about uh, them foreigners coming in here and stealing American jobs; that could be you!

Emily: Yeah, but it-it-itâs my whole lifeâyou come to England.

Ross: No, I canât. I would, I really would, but my son is here; I canât leave him. Isnâtâyou donât think thereâs any way?

Emily: Ohh, I donât think so. I mean it would be different if it was way into the future âand-and-and we were getting married or something.

Ross: What?

Emily: Oh no, no, right I shouldnât have said married. Uh, please donât go freaky on me. I didnât mean it. Well, I didnât say it; I take it back!

Ross: No, no, donât. Why donât we?

Emily: Why donât we what?

Ross: Get married.

Emily: You are mad!

Ross: No! No! Iâm not! Itâs-itâs-itâs perfect! I mean itâs better than you just-just moving here, âcause itâs us together forever, and thatâs-thatâs what I want.

Emily: Weâve only known each other for six weeks!

Ross: Yeah, I know, so what? I mean, whoâs-whoâs to say? Does that me we-we canât do it? Look, huh, I was with Carol for four years before we got married and I wound up divorced from a pregnant lesbian. I mean, this, this makes sense for us. Come on! I mean, on our first date we ended up spending the whole weekend in Vermont! I mean, last night I got my ear pierced! Me! This feels right. Doesnât it?

Emily: My parents are going to be really mad.

Ross: Is thatâare you saying yes? Is that yes?

Emily: Yes.

(They kiss and hug.)

Emily: Yes!

Ross: Yes! Weâre getting married?!

Emily: Oh my God!

Ross: Yes!

Emily: Weâre getting married!

Ross: Come here, come here. Uh, (He takes the earring out.) ow! Emily, will you marry me?

Emily: Yes.

(He tries to put it on her finger.)

Emily: Ohh, itâs a bit small.

Ross: Damn! I thought that was going to be romantic as hell!

Emily: It was.

(They kiss.)

Commerical Break

[Scene: The hallway, Joey and Chandler are coming back from the game.]

Chandler: Those were like the best seats ever.

Joey: Oh yeah. Hey! Should we give these shirts to the girls? Yâknow, kinda like a peace offering.

Chandler: Oh yeah, thatâs very nice. Plus, yâknow they were free and theyâre too small.

(He knocks on the girlsâ door and walks in. Surprise! The girls, obviously using Star Trek technology, have completely moved everything in both apartments back to their original positions, all in the time it took for the guys to go to a basketball game. Wow! Anyhoo, Chandler is stunned, and Joey doesnât even realise it.)

Chandler: Oh. Oh, God! (He starts running around like a chicken with his head cut off.)

Joey: Hey, want a beer? (Hands him a beer and sits down in one of the chairs.) (Jumping up.) WHOA!!!!

Chandler: I KNOW!!!

(They both sprint to what used to be their apartment.)

Chandler: Open up! Open up! Open up!

(A very angry Monica opens the door with the security chain still on.)

Monica: Weâll discuss it, in the morning! (Slams the door shut.)

Chandler: What the hell is going on?!

(Itâs Rachelâs turn to open the door.)

Rachel: We took our apartment back!! (Slams the door shut.)

Phoebe: (opening the door) I had nothing to do with it. (Closes the door.) (Opens the door.) Okay, it was my idea, but I donât feel good about it.

(She goes to close the door, but Chandler puts his foot it in.)

Chandler: We are switching back, right now!

Monica: No, weâre not! Weâre not leaving!

Chandler: Well, youâre gonna have to leave sometime, because you both have jobs, and as soon as you do, weâre switching it back! Thereâs nothing you can do to stop us! Right, Joe?

Joey: I donât know.

Chandler: What?

Joey: I donât want to move again!

Chandler: I donât care, this is our apartment! And they stoleâyou stole itâour apartment, and we won that apartment fair and square, twice! And I am getting it back right now. Iâm getting back right now!

(They open the door.)

Rachel: All right. We figured you might respond this way, so we have a backup offer.

Chandler: Oh no-no-no, no more offers. You canât offer anything to us!

Rachel: Let us keep the apartment andâ¦

Monica: As a thank you, Rachel and I will kiss for one minute.

[Time lapse. The guys are entering their apartment.]

Chandler: Totally worth it!

Joey: That was one good minute!

Chandler: Good night.

Joey: Good night.

(They both go back into their old rooms and shut the doors. Of course, Chandler has to close both sections of his door.)

[Cut to the girls apartment.]

Monica: Men are such idiots.

Rachel: Yeah! Can you believe that something that stupid actually got us our apartment back?

Phoebe: Thatâs so funny to think if youâd just done that right after the last contest, no one would have had to move at all.

Monica: Yeah, let-let-letâs pretend thatâs not true.

Rachel: Yeah.

Phoebe: Okay, scarfâs done. (Itâs not really a scarf, itâs just a bunch of yarn that Phoebe has tied together. Just then, Ross and Emily enter dragging with them Joey and Chandler.)

Ross: Come on! Come on. Come on.

Chandler: Okay!

Phoebe: Hey!

Ross: Hey!

Monica: What-whatâs going on?

Joey: Ross has some big thing to tell everyone.

Ross: Uhh, okay, itâs uh, Emily and I, we decided to uh, to get married.

(The gang is stunned.)

Phoebe: What? Oh, are you pregnant too?!

Emily: Umm, no.

Monica: When, when didâhow, how did youâ¦

Ross: We, we just decided to uh, to go for it.

Emily: I mean, we know itâs a bit hasty but, uh, it just feels so right, soâ¦

(Rachel slowly walks in from her bedroom. She is stunned speechless.)

Ross: (turning around.) Umm, uh, I was just telling the guysâ¦

Rachel: Yeah, I-I heard. (Pause, everyone looks at each other, waiting for Rachelâs reaction.) I think itâs great! (Hugs Ross.) Ohh, Iâm so happy for you!

(Seeing Rachelâs apparently okay with this, the rest of the gang jumps up to congratulate Ross and Emily on their pending nuptials.)

Chandler: Oh, well, thatâs great!

Joey: Yeah! Yeah!

Monica: (to Ross) I canât believe youâre getting married!

Ross: Yeah. (They hug again.)

Joey: Monica and Rachel made out. (Giggles like a schoolboy and Monica glares at him.)

Closing Credits

[Scene: Joeyâs bedroom, he is awoken by the singing guy.]

The Singing Man: (singing) Morningâs here! The morningâs here!

(Joey joins him.)

Both: Sunshine is here! The sky is clear, the morningâs here!

The Singing Man: Hey! Youâre back!

Joey: (happily) Okay!


[Scene: Joeyâs bedroom, he is asleep and snoring loudly. Chandler enters wondering who left their engine running.]

Chandler: Are you kidding me?! Joey. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey!!

Joey: (joining in, in his sleep) Joey. Joey. Joey. Joey! Joey!!

(Chandler acts disgusted, but is happy that Joey has stopped snoring. However, just as he is about to leave, Joey starts snoring again. So to get him to stop, he slams the door shut, waking Joey.)

Chandler: Oh. Oh, did-did-did I wake you?

Opening Credits

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is getting another cup of coffee.]

Chandler: Gunther, can I get another cup of coffee, please? (Gunther starts to pour him another cup.) So uh, what do you do when youâre not working here?

Gunther: You donât need to fill these silences.

Chandler: Oh, okay, thanks. (He goes back to the couch and rejoins Monica, Joey, and Phoebe.)

Monica: Chandler, thatâs like your fourth cup of coffee!

Chandler: Well, I am drinking lots of cups of coffee because Iâm exhausted! Because Joey started snoring!

Monica: Heâs in a different room! Heâs really that loud?

Joey: (proudly) Oh, you should here me.

Chandler: Itâs not something to be proud of, okay? You have to go to a sleep clinic!

Joey: Look, I told ya, Iâm not going to any clinic! I donât have a problem, youâre the one with the problem! You should go to a "Quit being a baby and leave me alone" clinic!

Chandler: They donât have those.

Joey: Yeah, they do! Quit being a baby and leave me alone! There, youâve just had your first class!

Monica: Yâknow I used to go out with this guy that was a really light sleeper, and whenever I started to snore, he would just roll me overâ¦

Joey: Ohhh, yeah!

Monica: He would just roll me over and I would stop snoring.

Chandler: Next time you snore, Iâm rolling ya over!

Joey: I gotta do what I gotta do, you gotta do what you gotta do, you just do it.

Ross: (entering) Hey guys!

Chandler: Hey, all right!

Phoebe: Hey!

(Joey starts humming Here Come the Bride.)

Phoebe: Oh, the Olympics.

Monica: Have you guys picked a date yet?

Ross: Oh no, not yet.

Phoebe: I still cannot believe youâre engaged! (Ross looks at her) Just âcause its happening so fast; not âcause youâre such a loser.

Ross: Oh. Thanks. Uh, has anyone seen Rach?

Monica: Ugh, sheâs upstairs not doing the dishes! And I tell ya something! Iâm not doing them this time! I donât care if those dishes sit in the sink until theyâre all covered withâIâll do them when I get home!

Ross: Yeahâoh! Hey listen umm, Emily found this wedding dress in Londonâ¦

Phoebe: Already?!

Ross: Yeah, but it didnât fit. Well, luckily thereâs a store here that has one left in her size, but Iâm the groom, Iâm not supposed to see the dressâ¦

Monica: Iâll pick it up for you!

Ross: Thank you.

Monica: Okay.

Chandler: Oh, sheâs got you running errands, yâknow, picking up wedding dressesâ¦ (Laughs and makes like Indiana Jones and his whip) Wah-pah!

Ross: Whatâs wah-pah?

Chandler: Yâknow, whipped! Wah-pah!

Joey: Thatâs not whipped! Whipped is wh-tcssh!

Chandler: Thatâs what I did. Wah-pah!

Joey: You canât do anything!

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is not doing the dishes. She hears someone coming up the stairs and quickly puts down her magazine and pretends like sheâs actually doing the dishes.]

Rachel: Hey, Mon, I was just doing the dishes!

Ross: Hey!

Rachel: Oh! Itâs you. (She stops doing the dishes.) Hi.

Ross: Hey, do uh, do you have a minute?

Rachel: Yeah, yeah, I was just about to take a break anyways, soâ¦

Ross: So listen uh, I know you and I havenât really had a chance to talk since uh, Emily and I decided to get married, and uh, I was just wondering how you were.

Rachel: Oh.

Ross: I know if you were getting married Iâd feel, kindaâ¦.. yâknow.

Rachel: Yeah. Yeah. Definitely, well it definitely took me by surprise, but Iâm okay.

Ross: Yeah?

Rachel: Yeah.

Ross: All right, I just wanted to check.

Rachel: Oh, thatâs sweet.

(He goes over to hug her.)

Ross: Youâre great. And I-I know someday this will happen for you too. You just hang in there.

Rachel: (breaking the hug) Uhh, hang in there?

Ross: Oh, no, I didnât mean, uhâ¦

Rachel: I mean maybe you didnât hear about a serious relationship called me and Joshua?

Ross: Oh, I thought you guys had just been on like four dates, I didnât realise that had become anything, yet.

Rachel: Oh, no-no-no, no-no-no, it has become, it hasâyeah. Oh no, those were four great dates.

Ross: Oh. Yeah?

Rachel: Yeah. Oh, yeah. And I mean, the connection, I mean yâknow, emotionally, mentally, physicallyâ¦

Ross: Wow, thatâs-thatâs-thatâs incredible.

Rachel: I know isnât it? Itâs like Iâm right there with Joshua.

Ross: Uh-huh.

Rachel: You are right there with Emily. And itâs yâknow, itâs kinda likeâ¦. itâs a tie! Well, I gotta get, I gotta get back to the dishes.

Ross: I gotta get to work.

Rachel: Oh yeah? Fine.

Ross: Hey, yâknow, yâknow what would make me really happy?

Rachel: Oh yeah, no, whatâs that?

Ross: If like the four of us could all yâknow, hang out together. Uh, in fact Emilyâs coming into town this weekend, why donât you say we all have dinner? Say, Sunday night?

Rachel: That would be great!

Ross: Yeah, all right, itâs a date. (He leaves)

Rachel: (to the closed door) Hang in there. You hang in there. (Gives him the raspberry.)

Joey: Yeah, Rach, I think youâre handling that really well.

Rachel: Handling it? What do you mean, handling it? Thereâs nothing to handle. Now, maybe I would have a problem with this if it wasnât for me and Joshua. Yâknow, theyâre not gonna get married anyway!

Phoebe: What did he say?

Rachel: Well uh, his answering machine was very understanding. Ugh. I feel blue.

Monica: Ohh, sweetie! (Goes to comfort her.) Hey, I bet you anything that heâs gonna call you again.

Rachel: Yeah, maybe, but I donât think I even care. I donât think heâs the one Iâm sad about. Yâknow, I know that I said that I am totally okay with Ross getting married, but as it turns out, I donât think Iâm handling it all that well.

Phoebe: Yeah, maybe.

Rachel: And I-I am just trying to figure out why.

Phoebe: Any luck?

Ross: Noo. Why?

Rachel: Well, apparently he scares easy.

Ross: Oh, Rachel, Iâm-Iâm sorry.

The Stripper: You are really good at that. So uh, I had fun tonight, you throw one hell of a party.

Joey: Oh thanks. Thanks. It was great meetinâ ya. And listen if any of my friends gets married, or have a birthday, or a Tuesdayâ¦

The Stripper: Yeah, that would be great. So I guess umm, good night.

Joey: Oh unless you uh, you wanna hang around.

The Stripper: Yeah?

Joey: Yeah. Iâll let you play with my duck.

[Scene: Joeyâs bedroom, itâs the middle of the night, heâs waking up and discovers heâs alone in bed.]

Joey: Hey, (realises he doesnât know her name.) stripper! (He notices that the ring box is open, so he picks it up, sees itâs empty and starts to panic.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, itâs continued from earlier. Joey is now waking Chandler and telling him the news.]

Joey: (running and banging on Chandlerâs door) The stripper stole the ring!! The stripper stole the ring!! Chandler! Chandler, get up! Get up! The stripper stole the ring!

Chandler: (opening the door) What?

Joey: The ring is gone!

Chandler: Ugh. Just a sec, give me a minute to wake up for thisâAh-ha-ha!! You lost the ring! Youâre the worst best man ever!

Joey: Dude, this isnât funny! What am I gonna do?! I go to bed last night, everythingâs cool! I wake up this morning, the stripperâs gone and the ring is gone!

Chandler: You slept with the stripper?

Joey: Of course!! (Shrugs.)

[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is entering, Monica and Rachel are talking on the couch.]

Phoebe: Hi, guys.

Rachel: Hi! Phoebe. (Both Monica and her try to move out of Phoebeâs way.)

Monica: Hi Phoebe.

Phoebe: I-I wanted to apologise if Iâyâknow seemed a tad edgy yesterday at my shower. Yâknow itâs just the hormones, yâknow.

Rachel: No weâ¦

Monica: Hormones.

Rachel: â¦hormones, yeah.

Phoebe: Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you, it was just, it was so sweet. (She goes to hug them and they both flinch, thinking that Phoebe is about to attack them.)

Monica: Wow, you seem to be doing so much better. Thatâs great. So how-how are things going?

Phoebe: Good. Yâknowâno-no, okay, itâs-it feels like everythingâs been about me lately, so whatâs happening with you?

Rachel: Oh, well, actually we were just talking about me not going to Rossâs wedding.

Phoebe: Oh!

Rachel: It just might be too hard, given the history and all thatâ¦

Phoebe: Wow! This reminds me of the time when I was umm, living on the street and this guy offered to buy me food if I slept with him.

Rachel: Well, h-how is this like that?

Phoebe: Well, letâs see, itâs not. Really, like that. Because, you see that was an actual problem, and uh, yours is just like yâknow a bunch of yâknow high school crap that nobody really gives yâknowâ¦

Rachel: (starting to cry) Iâm-Iâm sorry, I just thought thatâ¦

Phoebe: Alrighty, here come the water works. (Rachel starts crying harder.)

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is trying to figure out what to do.]

Joey: Ugh! I donât know what Iâm going to do! I called the company that sent and th-they donât care! Then I called 9-1-1 and they laughed at me, if this isnât an emergency, then what is?

Ross: (entering) Hey guys!

Chandler: Hey!

Joey: Heyâ¦

Ross: I just wanted to thank you again for last night, what a great party! And the guys from work had a blast. Yâknow, one of them had never been to a bachelor party before. Yeah! And-and another one had never been to a party before, soâ¦

Joey: So uh, hey, that uh, that wedding ring, huh? Man, thatâs nice!

Ross: Yeah, right!

Joey: I was uh, I was thinking I might want to pick one of those babies up for myself, I might want to get one of thoseâ¦

Ross: That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.

Chandler: So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable? (Gives Joey a little squeeze.)

Ross: Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.

Chandler: So you might say, itâs a magic ring.

Joey: (laughs, softly) Yeah, the stripper stole it.

Ross: My-my ring? My-my wedding ring? The-the stripper stole my wedding ring?! H-how?! How could this all happen?!

Chandler: Well, I think it all started when you said, "Hey Joey, why donât you be my best man."

Ross: (dialling the phone) All right-all right, fine! I-Iâm gonna call the cops!

Joey: Dude, I screwed up, you donât have to turn me in!

Ross: Not on you! On the stripper!

Joey: Oh, yeah, well I already did that! They said theyâre gonna look into it right after they solved all the murders.

Ross: Okay, well, weâll call the company that sent her!

Joey: I did that too! They wouldnât give me her real name or her number. They said, "If I bothered them again theyâd call the police." I said, "If you talk to the police, you tell them Iâm missing a ring!"

Ross: So what, Joey? Wh-wh-what? What are you telling me? That thereâs nothing we can do? Well, how could this happen?!

Joey: Look Ross, I am so-so sorry. I-I-Iâ¦

Chandler: Well, what if we just ah, called her, used a fake name, and had her come to my office?

Joey: Oh, that sounds like fun, but weâve got a ring to find!!

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are cautiously serving Phoebe some tea.]

Monica: Hereâs your tea Phoebe. (They give it to her and quickly take a step back.)

Phoebe: (sips it) Itâs so good. (Monica and Rachel breath a sigh of relief.) Oh, thanks.

Rachel: Good.

Monica: Iâm so glad you liked it.

Phoebe: (sets the cup down) Oh! (Grabs her stomach in pain.)

Monica: What?!

Rachel: What?! She made the tea! (Points to Monica.)

Phoebe: Oh! No, I-I think I just had a contraction.

Rachel: You what?

Monica: Oh my God!

Phoebe: Yeah, I thought I had one a couple of minutes ago, and now I know that was definitely one.

Monica: Wait, you canât have the baby here! I mean I havenât sterilised it since the guys moved out!

Rachel: Okay. Itâs okay. Weâre gonna be okay. Yâknow what? Itâs okay. Iâm gonna, Iâm gonna, Iâm gonna boil some water and just rip up some sheets!

Phoebe: No. Itâs all right; itâs probably false labour. They said that, that can happen near the end, just somebody get the book.

Monica: Rachel, get the book! The book!

Rachel: Okay! (Runs and grabs a book and hands it to Monica.) Okay! Here!

Monica: The Bible?!

Rachel: I donât know!

[Scene: Chandlerâs office, the guys are there waiting to ambush the stripper.]

Joey: All right, okay, this is great, uh, Chandler, you get behind the desk. And-and when she comes in hopefully, she wonât recognise you because, well, why would she? Uh, okay, and then you buzz Ross and I. (to Ross) You be Mr. Gonzalez, and Iâll be uh, Mr. Wong.

Ross: Diverse.

(Thereâs a knock on the door.)

The Stripper: Did anybody call for security?

Chandler: (to Ross) You be cool. (He opens the door and lets her in as they all turn there backs on her.)

The Stripper: Okay, which one of you guys is Gunther Central-Perk? (Sees Joey.) Hey, Joey?

Ross: Whereâs my ring? My dead grandmotherâs wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?

Chandler: Way to be cool, man.

The Stripper: Whatâs he talking about?

Joey: There was a ring, in a box, on my nightstand, after you left, it was gone!

The Stripper: Wait, you guys think I stole some ring?

The Guys: Yeah!

Ross: We know you took so just-just save yourself the time and confess!

The Stripper: Okay, who are you? The Hardy boys? Look, I donât need to steal some stupid ring, all right? I make $1,600 a week doing what I do; any of you guys make that?

Chandler: Marry me. (Both Ross and Chandler hit him.)

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, the guys are now trying to figure out what next to do, since their plan with the stripper backfired on them.]

Joey: I donât get it! It was in my room all night! And if she didnât take it, and I didnât take it; and you (Chandler) didnât take it, then who did? (The duck quacks.) Shh! Weâre trying to think! (Ross and Chandler realise it at the same moment and stare at Joey, who doesnât get it. After a short pause, with the duck still quacking, Joey figures it out and starts pointing at the duck.)

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is recovering from her false labour.]

Rachel: I still donât get how you know when itâs false labour.

Phoebe: Well, do you see any babies?

Monica: How do you feel?

Phoebe: Okay, I guess. I meanâ¦ I donât know, itâs just, I guess I know itâs going to be over soon.

Rachel: Well, isnât that a good thing? You said you were sick of this.

Phoebe: I know. Itâs just yâknow usually when youâre, when youâre done with the pregnant thing, yâknow, then you get to do the mom thing. Iâm gonna be yâknow, sitting around in my leather pants, drinking Tequila.

Monica: Some moms do that.

Phoebe: Okay thatâs even sadder. Look, I know, I know what I got myself into, itâs just that now that theyâre in me itâs like, itâs like I know them yâknow, I mean-I mean, itâs just not gonna be easy when these little babies have to go away.

Monica: Aww, sweetie, but itâs not like youâre not gonna have anything. Youâre gonna have nieces and nephews, and some ways thatâs even better.

Phoebe: Yeah, okay.

Rachel: No, really. Really, Pheebs, youâre not gonna be the one worrying about saving for college, or yelling at them when theyâre bad, yâknow, or deciding to put them on Ritalin when they just wonât calm down. Yâknow?

Monica: I mean, youâre the one theyâre gonna come to when they wanna run away from home, and the one they talk to about sex.

Rachel: And you just get to be cool Aunt Phoebe!

Phoebe: Cool Aunt Phoebe. I am pretty cool!

Monica: Yeah.

Rachel: And yâknow what else, oh my God, are they gonna love you.

Phoebe: They are gonna love me.

Rachel: Oh!

Phoebe: Thanks you guys! Again.

Monica: Oh, sweetie! (They all hug.)

Phoebe: Youâre the best. Thanks. Oh!

Monica and Rachel: What?!

Phoebe: Just kidding. Ahh!

Rachel: What?!

Monica: Oh my God!

Phoebe: Got cha again, you guys are so easy.

[Scene: The Animal Hospital, the guys have taken the duck in to remove the ring. Joey is pacing around like an expectant father.]

Joey: If anything should happen to himâ¦

Ross: Joey! The vet said itâs a simple procedure.

Joey: So! Things can go wrong! You donât know! What if he doesnât make it?!

Chandler: He will, Joe.

Joey: Yeah, but what if he doesnât? Heâs such a good duck.

(With that we go into a little flashback about the guysâ memories of the duck. The first one is Joey playing with him in the bathtub and drying him off. Then itâs Chandler sitting on his couch after they moved into the girls apartment, and Chandler reading to him in bed, and him watching Baywatch when all they had was the canoe and the duck was in a bucket of water. Then we see Ross eating some cereal and the duck watching him. He takes a lamp and moves the duck off of the table. Then itâs Chandler shooing them out of the bathroom in the girlsâ apartment, Joey revealing their disco cubby hole in the entertainment-center, then Chandler playing Hide-and-Go-Seek with them, and itâs concluded with various scenes with the duck flapping itâs wings. And the guys staring into the distance in remembrance of the duck.)

Joey: Iâm so worried about him, yâknow?

The Doctor: (coming in from surgery) Somebody lose a ring?

Ross: Oh my God! Thank you! Thank you so much! (He grabs the ring, kisses it, and then does a double-take realising where itâs been.)

Joey: H-h-h-howâs the duck?

The Doctor: Heâs doing just fine, heâs resting now, but you can see him in a little bit.

Joey: Ohh, great! Oh hey, listen Ross, thanks for being so cool about this.

Ross: No, thatâs all right.

Joey: No, itâs not. I mean you-you made me your best man and I totally let you down!

Chandler: Hey, come on, itâs not your fault.

Joey: Yeah, it is! You wouldnât have lost the ring, right? Yâknow what, Ross you were right from the start, he (Chandler) should be your best man.

Chandler: No, you should.

Joey: Now, donât argue with meâ¦

Ross: Hey! Hey! Hey! I get to choose my best man, and I want both you guys.

Chandler: Really?

Joey: Really?

Ross: Hey, both you guys should be up there with me. I mean, you two are-are myâ¦ I mean, Iâm lucky to have just one goodâ¦ (They all start getting emotional.)

Chandler: Thanks man.

Joey: (starting to cry) I gotta go check something over here. (He walks away so that they canât see him cry.)

Chandler: What a baby.

Ross: Total wuss!

(They both turn and wipe their eyes.)

Closing Credits

[There was no closing scene, only a preview of the wedding.]
[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey and Chandler are getting ready for the flight to London and Monica comes running in.]

Monica: Guys, hurry up! The flight leaves in four hours! It could take time to get a taxi! There could be traffic! The plane could leave early! When we get to London, there could be a line at customs! Come on!! (She runs back to her apartment.)

Chandler: Six-hour trip to London. Thatâs a lot of Monica.

[Cut to the girlsâ apartment, Monica is putting things into her purse as Phoebe and Rachel watch.]

Monica: Passport, check! (As she puts away each item, she says check.) Camera, check! Travellerâs cheques, check!

Rachel: Who are you saying "check" too?

Monica: Myself. Yâknow for remembering to pack a thing. Yeah, you do a good thing, you get a check! (pause) My mom does it, I never realized it was weird.

Phoebe: Yeah, my mom used to put her head in the oven. Well, actually, she only did it the one time. But it was pretty weird.

Ross: (entering) Hey!

Monica: Hey!

Ross: Hey! Are you ready yet?

Monica: Yep! You got the tickets?

Ross: Oh! Got âem right here, (Pats his coat pocket) check!

[Cut to the guysâ apartment.]

Joey: Itâs all London, baby! Here we go. (He takes a picture of a less than enthused Chandler and starts towards the girlsâ apartment.)

Chandler: You got your passport?

Joey: Yeah, in my third drawer on my dresser. You donât want to lose that.

(Chandler glares at him. At first Joey doesnât know why, it takes him a little bit to figure it out.)

Joey: Ohh!! (Runs to his room.)

Chandler: There it is.

Opening Credits

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, continued from earlier, Monica is telling Phoebe where everything is.]

Monica: Okay, if you need the vacuum, itâs in my closet on the left-hand side. Ah, the garbage bags are next to the refrigeratorâ¦

Phoebe: Okay, okay, but Rachelâs gonna be here too, canât I just ask her this stuff?

Monica: Yeah, okay, give that a try!

Chandler: (entering, with Joey) All right! Letâs do it!

Joey: Woo-hoo!!

Ross: Yeah, cheerie-o!

Joey: (louder) London baby!!

Chandler: Hey, yâknow what? I was wrong.

Ross: Well, weâre all here! I guess we should get going!

Phoebe: Ohhh, I wanna come over there and give you a hug and wish you luck on your wedding, but I donâtâcanât get up.

Ross: Oh, Iâll-Iâll come hug you.

Phoebe: Great! Yeah, could you bring me the newspaper?

Ross: Yeah. (He does so and Phoebe hugs him.)

Phoebe: Oh, have a great wedding!

Ross: Thanks.

Phoebe: Oh, hey, Chandler I wanna hug you too!

Chandler: Hey! (Trots over)

Phoebe: Oh, and great! You might as well bring me my book, itâs on the counter in your apartment.

Chandler: Oh. (Goes and gets Phoebeâs book as Rachel comes in from her room.)

Ross: (to Rachel) So, weâre off.

Rachel: Have fun!

Ross: Thanks! (They hug.) Ugh, I canât believe youâre not gonna be there!

Rachel: Oh, I know.

Ross: So-so come! Why donât you come?

Rachel: What?!

Ross: To London! Come to London. Please? Itâll mean so much to me.

Rachel: Yeah, well, I gotta work, Iâm sorry.

Ross: Why-why canât you take a couple of days off?

Rachel: Because, I canât! Ross, I told you, no. I canât.

Ross: This is my wedding.

Monica: All right, yâknow what? We really are late! Letâs go! Letâs go! Letâs go!!

Ross: Fine. Youâll-youâll watch it on video when we get back.

Chandler: (entering, with Phoebeâs book.) Here you go Phoebe! Here you go Phobo! Phewbedo! Phaybobo.

Phoebe: (laughs) Thank you.

(Chandler kneels down with his arms spread waiting for his hug.

Phoebe: Thank you. (She pats him on his head.)

Ross: All right, letâs go! Bye, Pheebs!

Joey: Bye, Pheebs!

(They all start out, Rachel gives each one a kiss, and says "bye." In the hall, Joey saysâ¦)

Joey: London baby!! (And Rachel slowly closes the door, sadly.)

Phoebe: Oh, do you need a hug? You donât have to bring me anything!

(And with that, television history is made as, for the first time ever, an entire show moves itâs entire production to an entirely different country to make a single episode. We get shots of Buckingham Palace, London Bridge, Big Ben, and the London Marriott as Joey and Chandler exit.)

[Scene: Street in front of the London Marriott, Joey and Chandler exit. Joey is carrying a video camera and is shooting Chandler.]

Joey: Come on! Do something!

Chandler: I am, Iâm ignoring you.

Joey: Okay, here! (Gives him the camera.) I wanna be the on camera guy. All right, first stop, Westminster Abbey. (Joey folds out his "pop-up" map of London. All of the major landmarks pop-up like in a pop-up book.)

Chandler: Oh, what the hell is that?

Joey: Itâs London, baby! All right, the hotelâs here. (Points to the map.) Wait. No, we wanna goâ¦ No. I know. (Sets the map down.) Iâm gonna have to go into the map. (So Joey literally steps into the map.)

Chandler: Okay, if you see a little version of me in there? Kill it!

Joey: I got it! (Picks up the map and starts walking.) Here we go.

Chandler: Okay. Listen-listen, weâre not gonna have to walk this way the entire time are we?

Joey: Shhh! (Pause) Man, you made me lose it! (He goes into the map again.)

[Scene: Another street, somewhere along the River Themes, Ross, Emily, and Monica are walking to where theyâre gonna get married. Emily is relating the troubles with the caterer.]

Emily: â¦and that was all before 10 oâclock. The caterer rang and said it was going to be Chicken Kiev instead of Chicken Tarragon. And then the florist phoned to say there arenât any tulips. Oh, and the chilliest has carpel-tunel syndrome. Weâre not gonna beâ¦

Ross: Whoa-whoa-whoa! Emily, (Gives her the time-out signal.) honey, okay?

Emily: Well, up yours too!

Ross: What?! No! No! Thatâs-thatâs time-out!

Emily: Sorry.

Ross: Sweetie, you gotta relax. Everythingâs gonna be great, okay? Come on. Come on.

Monica: Chicken Kiev?

Ross: Um-hmm! Doesnât that sound delicious at the last minute?

Monica: Yeah, yâknow, but something like salmon which would be so much more elegant than the chicken. And, you wouldnât have to worry about the salmonella. (Ross pushes her.) So, I canât wait to see this place youâre getting married!

Ross: Yeah. Yeah. Yes, this place is beautiful. Emilyâs parents got married here.

Emily: I still canât believe theyâre tearing it down. It really is the most lovely building youâll ever see. I mean itâs overâ¦ (She stops suddenly, when she sees that demolition has already started.) Oh my God!

Monica: Itâs nice.

Emily: Oh. Oh. (She starts running towards the building.)

[Cut to inside.]

Emily: (running in, with Ross) Oh. Oh my God. How can this be happening? What are we going to do?

Ross: Itâs all right! Everythingâs gonna be all right.

Emily: Howâs it gonna be all right?!

Ross: Uh-huh, I see that.

Monica: (entering) Okay, I talked to the guy with the shovel and I found out what happened.

Ross: What? What?

Monica: They torn it down a few days early.

[Scene: Westminster Abbey, Joey and Chandler have successfully navigated the streets of London and are approaching the Abbey.]

Joey: All right! Westminster Abbey! Hands down, best Abbey Iâve ever seen. Hey! (Pushes Chandler in front of the camera.) Okay. What do you think of the Abbey, Chandler?

Chandler: I think itâs great. Itâs great. Yâknow, theyâre thinking of changing the name of this place.

Joey: Really? To what?

Chandler: To Put the Camera Away!!!

Joey: Man, you are Westminster Crabby. (He starts chasing Chandler towards the Abbey.)

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is trying to move off of the couch as Rachel enters.]

Phoebe: Oh. Oh.

Rachel: Oh, honey! Donât get up! What do you need?

Phoebe: Oh, no. Oh, nothing.

Rachel: Come on! I am here to take care of you! What do you need? Anything.

Phoebe: Okay, I have a wedgie.

Rachel: Okay, that is all you.

Phoebe: So-so, what do you want for lunch?

Rachel: Oh, I donât know. I guess we have to eat.

Phoebe: Yeah, I do. Whatâs the matter?

Rachel: Iâm just bummed about the way I left things with Ross. I shouldnât have lied to him about having to work. He seemed so mad at me.

Phoebe: Eh, donât be so hard on yourself. If someone I was still in love with was getting marriedâ¦

Rachel: (interrupting) Still in love with?!

Phoebe: Yeah!

Rachel: Iâm not in love with Ross!

Phoebe: Oh. No. No. Good! Yeah, me neither.

Rachel: Phoebe, Iâm going to Rossâs wedding because he is my ex-boyfriend and that would be really uncomfortable. Not because, Iâm still in love with him! I mean, hey, yâknow, I like Ross as much as the next guy, yâknow? Clearly I have feelings for him, but feelings donât mean love! I mean, I still have loving feelings for Ross. Yeah! But, I have, I have continuing feelings of love, but that doesnât mean that-that Iâm still in love with him. Yâknow? I-I have sexual feelings for him, but I do love himâOhh! Oh my God! Oh myâwhy didnât you tell me?!!

Phoebe: We thought you knew!

Rachel: We?!

Phoebe: Yeah, we all know! We talk about it all the time!

Rachel: You all know? Does Ross know?

Phoebe: Oh no, Ross doesnât know anything.

Rachel: Oh, I can not believe you didnât tell me!

Phoebe: Well, because we thought you knew!! Itâs so obvious! God, that would be like telling Monica, "Hey, you like things clean."

[Scene: A park in London, Joey and Chandler walk up to a souvenir stand.]

Joey: Hey!

The Vendor: So, what are you guys in the market for? Weâve got uh, scarves, tulip post cards...

Joey: Check this out? Huh? (Joey has this big tall hat with a British flag on the front of it.) Yeah. Thatâs the stuff. What do you think?

Chandler: Well, I donât have to buy that, "Iâm with stupid" T-shirt anymore.

Joey: Well, I like it. Here you go. (He pays for the hat.)

Chandler: All right, look, youâre not really gonna buy that are you? Donât you think youâve embarrassed me enough for one day?

Joey: Oh, I embarrass you?

Chandler: How can I answer that when Iâm pretending I donât know you?

The Vendor: Heâs just jealous. Youâll fit right in; all Londoners wear them!

Chandler: Oh really? Then how come no one here is wearing them?

The Vendor: (looks around) Theyâre all tourists.

Chandler: All right, look, if you insist on wearing that, in public, yâknow, youâre gonna spend the rest of the afternoon all by yourself.

Joey: Oh yeah? (Puts the hat on.) If youâre gonna make me choose between you and the hat? I choose the hat.

The Vendor: Good choice.

Joey: Thanks.

Chandler: Okay, wait. All right, thatâs it, okay, Iâm out of here. I am not going to be embarrassed anymore! (He trips over a box, falls into a flower stand and walks away trying to be cool.)

[Scene: The hotel, Rossâs room, Emily is entering.]

Emily: Hello?

Ross: Hey! I just spoke to your dad, and you know what? He seems to think weâll be able to find a new place for the wedding.

Emily: We donât have to.

Ross: Whoa-whoa-what? You found a place?

Emily: No. But, Monica and I were talking, and-and I was so upset about the hall being knocked down, and she suggested that we put the wedding off for a bit.

Ross: She said what?

Emily: She said, "If Iâm not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day, well then we should just postpone it."

Ross: Postpone it? Emily, do you think Monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding? Do you my sisterâs teeny-tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here, huh? (He puts his pants on backwards.) This isnât right.

Emily: I realize that people are going to be disappointed. But, Iâm sure theyâll come back when we can do it right.

Ross: I canât ask people to do that? Would you ask people to do that? (Holds out his pants)

Emily: Donât you point your pants at me! (She throws them on the floor.) We have no choice! Anywhere thatâs half-decent wouldâve be booked months ago, Ross donât you understand? This is our wedding Iâm talking about.

Ross: The only thing I understand is; postponing it is not an option. This is when weâre getting married.

Emily: So what are you saying? Itâs now or never?

Ross: No. Iâm saying itâs now. (He starts putting on his pants, backwards again.)

Emily: Or?

Ross: Thereâs no âorâ in mind. What is wrong with these pants?!!

Emily: Itâs not the pants. Itâs you that is backwards. And if, and if you donât understand how important this is to me, well then, perhaps we shouldnât get married at all! (She storms out.)

Ross: (chasing her, trying to zip up his pants. His got them on right now.) No, wait! Emily! No, wait, stop! Emily, pleaseâ(He catches something important in the zipper and howls like a little boy and falls to the floor.)

Rachel: Manhattan does not have enough stores.

Rachel: You can?

Phoebe: Yeah. I just need you to bring me some photos of Ross.

Rachel: Um-hmm.

Phoebe: And a small piece of chocolate.

Rachel: Okay.

Phoebe: And a glass of tepid water. (She gathers up all of these things.)

Rachel: Ooh, is this one of those things where you throw it in a bag with some graveyard dirt and hang it from a north-facing tree?

Phoebe: Uh, only if you have the hiccups too. Yeah, the pictures are for you, the water and the chocolate is for me. I just didnât feel like getting up. Okay, Iâm gonna show you a picture of Ross. Okay? And youâre going to remember all of the bad things about him. All right? Really focus on his flaws.

Rachel: I can do that. I certainly did it when we were going out.

Phoebe: Okay. Umm, before we get started, I just wanna say for the record that I love Ross, I think heâs such a great guy. Here. (Hands her the picture, Rachel grabs it out of her hand.) Okay, now, close your eyes. And imagine that youâre with Ross okay and imagine that youâre kissing him. And youâre-youâre running your hands all over his body. And then you run your hands through his hair, but eew-oh gross itâs some kind of grease, itâsâuck! Hah?

Rachel: I donât know, his uh, his hair never really bothered me that much, and yâknow it was always more crunchy than it was greasy.

Phoebe: Okay, this is going to be harder than I thought. Umm, letâs try some uh, aversion therapy.

Rachel: Okay.

Phoebe: Okay?

Rachel: All right.

Phoebe: So uh, now look at the pictureâ¦

Rachel: Okay.

Chandler: No-no-no, yâknow what? I really shouldnât have said that you were embarrassing me, I mean that really wasnât cool. And if it makes you feel any better, Iâve had a really lousy day.

Joey: Me too.

Chandler: Yeah?

Monica: Oh my God!

Joey: Thatâs Fergie baby!!

Fergie: Joey says you donât really like his hat, but I think itâs kinda dashing.

Chandler: How did you? How? How?

Joey: Well, I was trying to figure out how to get to Buckingham Palace, right? So, Iâm in my map and-andâ¦(Ross enters) Hey!

Monica: Hey!

Monica: Ummâ¦

Chandler: Iâm gonna go to the bathroom.

Joey: Wait up! (They both run to the bathroom.)

Ross: Hey-hey, since youâre the âfix-itâ lady, hereâs a pickle, what do you do when the bride says she doesnât want to have the wedding at all?

Monica: She said that?!

Ross: Yeah.

Monica: Why?!

Ross: I donât know, I told her it was stupid to put off the wedding just because the hall was gone and she liked flipped out.

Monica: Oh my God. Youâre even dumber than I am!

Ross: Excuse me?

Monica: Ross, how long have you been planning this wedding?

Ross: I donât know. A month?

Monica: Emily has probably been planning it since she was five! Ever since the first time she took a pillowcase and hung it off the back of her head. Thatâs what we did! We dreamed about the perfect wedding, and the perfect place, with the perfect four-tiered wedding cake (Starting to cry), with the little people on top. (Ross gets thrown a box of Kleenex from the bathroom and he gives her one.) Thanks. But the most important part is that we had the perfect guy who understood just how important all that other stuff was.

Ross: I had no idea. And that-that pillowcase thing, I thought you guys were just doing the flying nun.

Monica: Sometimes we were.

Ross: Come on. You gotta help me figure out what to do. Okay?

Monica: Okay.

Ross: Come on. (They leave and Chandler sticks his head out.)

Chandler: That was pretty intense huh?

Joey: Yeah. (Pause) Hey, I hope Ross didnât think that we just went in there because we were uncomfortable being out here!

Chandler: (glares at him) I hope he did!

Joey: That just cost me four bucks. But uh listen, I just called to see how the chick and the duck are doing?

Phoebe: Ohh, theyâre having a great time with their Aunt Phoebe! Aunt Rachel hasnât been helpful at all. So, do you miss me?

Joey: Kinda, but Iâve just been having way too much fun.

Phoebe: So youâre not homesick yet?

Joey: No, I donât think so.

Monica: And the musicians, look, they can go over here (Points to a little alcove), okay? And the chairs can face this way (Points), andâ¦ (Points to Ross) You go.

Ross: But-but, if you donât love this, weâll do it in any other place at any other time. Really, itâs fine, whatever you want.

Rachel: Yeah, I have to tell Ross that I love him. Now honey, you take care, you donât have those babies until I get back. (Kisses her stomach.)

Phoebe: IâRachel, you canât go! Ross loves Emily!

Rachel: Yeah, I know, I know, I know he does. But I have to tell him how I feel! He deserves to have all the information and then he can make an informed decision.

Phoebe: Thatâs not why youâre going! Youâre going because you hope heâs gonna say, "Yeah, I love you too, Rach. Forget that British chippy."

Rachel: OhhâDo you think he will?!

Phoebe: No! Because heâs in love with the British chippy! Look, Rachel, if you go, youâre just gonna mess with his head and ruin his wedding! Yâknow, itâs too late! You missed youâre chance! Iâm sorry, I know this must be really hard, itâs over.

Rachel: Yâknow what? No. Itâs not over until someone says, "I do." (Exits)
