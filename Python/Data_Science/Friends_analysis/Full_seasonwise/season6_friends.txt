Chandler: We actually missed it.

Phoebe: Well, maybe you wouldnât have had you (turns to the attendant) run in the chapel!

Monica: This is insane!

Phoebe: Whatâs the big deal, yâknow? Itâs not like itâs a real marriage.

Chandler: What?!

Phoebe: Yeah, if you get married in Vegas, youâre only married in Vegas.

Monica: What are you talking about? If you get married in Vegas youâre married everywhere.

But David was a busy boy during the off season for not only did he marry but everyone else as well. For theyâre all listed as Jennifer Aniston Arquette, Lisa Kudrow Arquette, in an interesting twist Matt LeBlanc Arquette, Matthew Perry Arquette, David Schwimmer Arquette, and even the creators of the show are now David Crane Arquette and Marta Kauffman Arquette.

Joey: Morninâ Pheebs. (Sits down.) Well, my movie has officially been canceled.

Phoebe: Oh Joey, Iâm so sorry. You want some of my breakfast?

Joey: Nah, Iâm too depressed to eat. Iâll probably eat in like 5 minutes. So I guess Iâll just fly home with you guys, what timeâs your flight?

Phoebe: What about my cab?

Joey: I donât need that anymore.

Phoebe: No, Joey! You borrowed my cab; you have to drive it back.

Joey: I donât want to drive all the way back by myself, I get so lonely. (Gets an idea.) Ohâooh! How about you come with me?

Phoebe: I donât know, itâs such a long trip.

Joey: Itâll be great! We-we could talk, and play games! Huh? This could be our chance to like renew our friendship.

Phoebe: Are you asking me to have a frenaissance?

Joey: Sure?

Phoebe: All right. Although I donât think we need one, I never stopped loving you.

Chandler: Hi!

Joey: Hey.

Monica: Hey.

Chandler: So, has anyone talked to Dr. and Mrs. Geller yet?

Chandler: Monica and I almost got married last night.

Joey: Oh my God! Thatâs huge! (Hugs him.) Wait a minute, why come I wasnât invited? And who was going to be your best man? Donât say, "Ross." Do not say, "Ross."

Chandler: Look, I just donât think Monica and I are ready to get married yet! Yâknow? I mean, I love her and everything but seeing Ross and Rachel coming out of that chapel was like a, like a wake-up call that Monica and I are moving so fast. Yâknow? And, how do I tell her without crushing her?

Joey: Oh! Tell her sheâs not marriage material.

Chandler: What?!

Joey: Girls say it to me all the time! And believe me, if sheâs anything like me, sheâs just gonna be relieved.

[Pan to Monica and Phoebe having the same conversation.]

Monica: How do I tell Chandler that itâs too soon. Itâs gonna break his heart, heâs not gonna think that I donât love him anymore.

Phoebe: Well you donât.

Monica: Yes I do!

Phoebe: Good! Good! I was just testing you.

Chandler: (returning with Joey) Hi.

Monica: Oh hi! Hi! Yâknow, we were just talking about bacon.

Phoebe: No, we were talking about tennis. Tennis is more believable.

(Ross and Rachel enter.)

Ross: Hey!

The Girls: Hey!

Chandler: Hey!

(They both sit down and Rachel pours them both some coffee. Theyâre acting like nothingâs happened and everyone is just staring at them.)

Ross: What?

Chandler: Are we gonna talk about what you guys did last night? Orâ¦

Rachel: (To Ross) I donât know. (To the gang.) What do you mean last night? Nothing, nothing uh, happened last night.

Ross: Yeah!

Phoebe: Uh-huh! Ross invited us all to watch.

(Rachel turns to Ross stunned.)

Monica: Rach! We werenât gonna miss our friends getting married!

Rachel: (gasps) Who got married?! (Ross is as surprised to hear this as she is.)

Chandler: (not quite sure) You did.

Ross: What?! Hello! We didnât get married.

Rachel: No, we didnât get married! Thatâs ridiculous!

(They turn to look at each other and suddenly remember that they did in fact get married.)

Ross: We-we-weâI remember being in a chapel.

Rachel: Oh my God.

Ross: IâThey would not let us get married when we were that drunk!

Rachel: No!

Joey: They let you get married when youâre drunk! Most people who get married in Vegas are drunk!

Phoebe: Hell, Iâm drunk right now! (They all turn and look at her.) What? I canât have a mimosa with breakfast?! Iâm on vacation!

Monica: What are you guys gonna do?

Rachel: Well, I guess we just find a divorce lawyer? (Looks at Ross.)

Chandler: Well, I think, I think, Ross already has one. Now, this oneâs free, right? Because you paid for the first two, so the third oneâs free.

Ross: Laugh it up, but the jokeâs on you. Because we donât need to get divorced, okay? We weâre just gonna get an annulment.

Joey: An annulment? Ross! I donât think surgeryâs the answer here.

Phoebe: Oh-oh, thatâs your thing.

Ross: What?

Phoebe: Youâre thing. Youâre thing. Yâknow? Youâre the guy who gets divorced.

All: Oh yeah!

Ross: No-no, thatâs-thatâs not my thing! I do not love getting divorced!

Phoebe: Yes you do! This is your third divorce! You love divorce so much youâre probably gonna marry it! Then it wonât work out and youâre gonna have to divorce it, divorcing guy. (Pause) Iâm so drunk.

[Scene: The casino floor, Chandler and Monica are walking through it.]

Monica: So, what do you think we should do?

Chandler: I donât know. But I-I-I know I love you!

Monica: I know I love you! (They hug.)

Chandler: So where are we on the whole going back to the place where they have all the marriages thing? I love you.

Monica: Thatâs a good question. Look umm, last night we let the dice decide. Maybe we should leave it up to fate again. I love you!

Chandler: Yes, we donât get married unless thereâs a sign! Okay, so say uh, say you roll another eight (motions to the craps table) then thereâs a definite sign that we should get married.

Monica: All right, eight we get married, but 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 we donât get married.

Chandler: Sounds great.

Monica: Okay. (They approach the craps table.)

Croupler: Coming in, we got a shooter! Money please.

Monica: Ready?

Chandler: Ready!

Monica: (sarcastic) Come on eight.

Chandler: (deadpan) Yes, yes eight.

(Monica rolls the dice.)

Croupler: Eight! Easy eight. (She rolls a 3 and a 5 and theyâre stunned.)

Monica: Wow! I canât believe I actually rolled an eight.

Chandler: That was so unlikely. Well, letâs get married! I guess.

Monica: Wait a minute. That wasnât a hard eight! Last night I rolled a hard eight.

Chandler: Thatâs right! It was the wrong kind of eight, no wedding! Damnit!

Monica: I wanted it so bad! (Pause) Wanna go pack?

Chandler: Yeah. (They go pack.) Weâre doing the right thing, right?

Monica: Ohh, of course we are! (They walk up to the elevators.) We left it up to fate. (Pushes the elevator button.) If we were supposed to get married there would be a clear-cut sign. (The elevator door opens to a priest reading from a bible with Chandler and Monica standing side-by-side holding each otherâs hands.)

[Scene: Phoebeâs cab, Phoebe and Joey are driving back. Phoebe is driving while Joey is sleeping.]

Joey: (wakes up) What?!

Phoebe: Well, you promised me a fun road trip! Weâve been on the road six hours and youâve been asleep for five and a half! We are switching at the next rest stop and you are going to drive all the way back! That will be your punishment, you greedy sleeper!

Joey: All right. All right.

Phoebe: Yeah! And until then you are going to sing to me because the radioâs broken and you are selfish but have a nice voice.

Joey: Really? I donâtâ¦

Phoebe: Sing!!

Joey: (starts singing) I wanna rock and roll all night! (Falls asleep.)

[Time lapse, Phoebe is asleep, Joeyâs driving and having a hard time staying awake.]

Ross: Iâm not going to do that. (Rachel glares at him.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: Central Perk, continued from earlier. Rachel starts laughing.]

Rachel: Okay! So, weâll just stay married.

Ross: Yes, exactly!

Rachel: And I will make everyone call me Mrs. Geller!

Ross: Wow! This is so amazing. I uh, I really thought Iâd have to talk you into this more.

Rachel: Okay, see now Iâm scared because I donât actually think youâre kidding.

Ross: Iâm-Iâm not kidding. Look I-I, I canât have three failed marriages. I canât. Okay? I-I am not gonna be that guy!

Rachel: What-wh-what so weâll just stay married forever?!

Ross: Okay, look, how is this gonna affect you? Really? I mean you fill some form out once and a while and instead of checking the box that says Ms you check the box that says Mrs.! Itâs right next to it!

Rachel: Ohh, okay, Iâm sorry. Youâre right. Yâknow what? We absolutely can stay married, because I was under the impression that the boxes were far away from each other. All right, look, just please, take a moment here and think about what youâre asking of me.

Ross: Iâm asking you to do me a favor.

{Note: Does anyone else want to smack Ross right about now? Raise your hands. Okay, put them down before you stink out the person next to you.}

Rachel: You are asking me to be your wife!

Ross: And as my wife I think you should grant me this favor.

[Scene: The hallway, Chandler is helping Monica to the door.]

Monica: Okay! Oh God, yâknow what? Itâs really bad.

Chandler:  Well, I told you not to walk. Here. (Picks her up.) There. Okay. (He opens the door, carries her across the threshold, stops, backs out, and lets go of Monica who is only holding on by his neck.)

Monica: This doesnât mean anything, does it?

Chandler: No!

Monica: Okay.

[Scene: Phoebeâs cab, sheâs driving, Joeyâs in the back seat, and the hitchhiker is riding up front with Phoebe.]

Phoebe: (To Joey) How could you pick up a hitchhiker?! He could be a rapeâ(She holds her hand in front of the hitchhikerâs face), a rapist or a killer or something!

Joey: Donât you think I asked him that before he got in?!

Phoebe: Yâknow what? Iâm not talking to you! You go back to sleep! (To the hitchhiker) And you, are you a rapist?!

Hitchhiker: No!

Phoebe: Do you like car games?

Hitchhiker: Yeah, yâknow the license plate game?

Phoebe: I love the license plate game!

Ross: Hey!

Rachel: Hey!

Ross: Listen, I know you wanted to talk to me, but I have an idea that may make you want to stay married. (Rachel shakes her head.) We register, and you get to keep all the presents!

Rachel: (thinks about it for a second) No! Ross, come on! No! Listen, look I thought a lot about how to tell you this and the bottom line, Ross, is we can not stay married.

Ross: I donât know if itâs true.

Rachel: Oh b-b-but it is!

Ross: Oh, okay, yâknow what this is? This is a difference of opinion. And when that happens in a marriage...

Rachel: Oh Ross, come on! This is not, this is not a marriage!! This is the worldâs worst hangover! Ross, listen, if you do not get this annulment, I will!

Ross: All right. All right, Iâll do it.

Phoebe: Oh, okay.

Hitchhiker: This is where I get off. Well, I have your address and phone number.

Phoebe: And I have your name and the fact that youâre a drifter, so the ballâs pretty much in your court.

Hitchhiker: All right, see ya Pheebs. (Gets out and Phoebe drives away.)

Joey: Come on Pheebs! I canât take this anymore! Let-let me make it up to you. Huh? (Starts singing.) Ground control to Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on. Take your protein pills and put your helmet on!

Phoebe: Stop it! Stop it no! Thatâs not fair! Yâknow I canât resist that beautiful voice!

Joey: Pheebs, I am so sorry! I know I promised you a fun road trip with your friend and I didnât deliver. But-but-but now I know that you think being awake is an important part of friendship! So, so, so I will strive to-to stay awake for as long as I know you.

Phoebe: You can still sleep at night and stuff.

Joey: Well, thank you. So, can we play 20 Questions now? Iâve got a really good one! Iâve been thinking about it since Kansas.

Phoebe: Okay. Is it a kind of hot sandwich?

Joey: Yes.

Phoebe: Is it a meatball sub?

Joey: That is incredible! You are the master!

Chandler: (entering, slowly) Yâknow I was thinking, what if I uh, unpack here?

Monica: Then all your stuff would be here.

Chandler: Well, what if all my stuff was here?

Monica: Then youâd be going back and forth all the time, I mean it doesnât make any sense.

Chandler: Okay. What if we lived together and you understand what Iâm saying?

Monica: Live together? There have been no signs for that.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Monica are cuddling on the couch.]

Chandler: Yâknow when we move in together, can I get a gumball machine?

Monica: Of course! Joey wouldnât let you have one?

Chandler: No. When it comes to sweets, heâs surprisingly strict.

Monica: Hey, have you figured out a way to tell him youâre moving out?

Chandler: No, no, I keep trying, yâknow? I can get out, "Joey, I have tooâ¦" but then I lose my nerve and I always finish with, "â¦go to the bathroom." He may think Iâm sick.

Monica: Yâknow, I really have to tell Rachel, but Iâ¦ We just have to get it over with! Yâknow, the next time we see them weâre just gonna tell them. Okay? Thatâs it.

Chandler: Oh, so thatâs this is gonna work now? Youâre just gonna order me around all the time?

Monica: Pretty much.

Chandler: All right.

Joey: (entering) Hey Monica!

Monica: Hi!

Joey: (To Chandler) Hey man, you feeling any better? (Chandler answers him with some guttural sounds that only he can make and that no human can transcribe.)

Monica: Joey, we have something to tell you.

Joey: Oh my God! Youâre pregnant!

Chandler: No-o-o! (To Monica) No? (She nods no.) No-o-o! Look Joey, hereâs the thing, Monica and I have decided to live together, here. So, Iâm gonna be moving out man.

Joey: Wow! (Tearing up) Well, uhâ¦ Hey! Iâm really happy for you guys! Congratulations! (Kisses Monica on the cheek) See you later. (Starts for the door on the verge of tears as Monica stops him.)

Monica: Wait! Joey! Joey! Are you okay?!

Joey: Yeah, I gotta go! I got an acting job. (Turns towards the door, pauses, and turns back.) Like youâd believe that. This sucks!

Chandler: Look, I-Iâm just gonna be right across the hall and I promise you, the minute Monica and I break up Iâm moving right back in with you!

Joey: (To Monica) Okay! Look-look-look, uh, if youâre gonna be moving in with him I feel itâs my responsibility to tell you the truth about him! Okay? Heâs a terrible roommate! Terrible! He uh, forgets to ummâ¦ Oh-oh he always, he always ummâOh, who am I kidding! Heâs the best roommate ever! (Hugs Chandler.)

[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is on the couch as Monica enters.]

Monica: Hey Pheebs!

Phoebe: Hey!

Monica: Hey, have you seen Rachel?

Phoebe: No, why?

Monica: I have some pretty exciting news!

Phoebe: (gasps) Youâre pregnant!

Monica: No! Chandler and I are moving in together!

Phoebe: Ooh! Thatâs good! Wow! But now if you were pregnant, what would you name it? Hint: Phoebe.

(Ross returns from getting some coffee.)

Ross: Hey! Hi!

Monica: Hey!

Ross: Whatâs up?

Monica: Well umm, Chandler and I are moving in together.

Ross: Oh my God. Ohh, my little sister and my best friendâ¦shaking up. Oh, thatâs great. Thatâs great. (Kisses and hugs her.)

Phoebe: Guys, Iâm happy too.

Monica: Okay, come here! (Phoebe joins them in the hug.)

Phoebe: Wow! Big day huh? People moving in, people getting annulledâ¦ (Winks at Ross.)

Monica: Okay, I gotta go find Rachel but umm, if you guys see her could you please try to give her some really bad news so that mine doesnât seem so bad? (Exits.)

Ross: Bye.

Phoebe: Hmm, something bad to tell Rachelâ¦ Bad news for Rachel, what could that be?!

Ross: Could ya just, could ya just lay off, please? All right? My life is an embarrassment! I should go live under somebodyâs stairs!

Phoebe: Ross, itâs not that big a deal! So youâll been divorced three times, youâll still have a life, youâll go on datesâ¦

Ross: (interrupting) No! No, I wonât! Iâll be at the bottom of the dating barrel now. The only guys below me will be Four Divorce Guy uh, Murderer Guy, and-and, Geologists.

Phoebe: Ross, youâre being ridiculous! Okay? You are cute and smart and sweet and that is much more important than three stupid divorces!

Ross: Oh yeah? Have you ever dated anyone who has been divorced three times?

Phoebe: Yâknow thatâs really fair. Yâknow? Most guys who have been divorced three times are like 60. Ross, nobody cares about this except you! This-this embarrassment thing is all in your head! Here, Iâll show you! Come here.

Ross: What?! Why?

(She grabs his arm and drags him over to a table where three beautiful women are sitting. Now, Iâm going to go out on a limb and say that their names are Stephanie, Karin, and Meg. Okay, so I looked at the credits. Of course, only Meg is named later on, so Iâll have to guess who is Stephanie and who is Karin. But, weâll cross that bridge when we come to it.)

Phoebe: (to the girls) Hi! Hi! Listen, my friend Ross is about to be divorced for the third time, but wouldnât you date him?

Ross: And if you wait right here, Iâll go get Ross. (Phoebe grabs his arm and prevents him from escaping.)

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is pacing anxiously waiting for Rachel.]

Chandler: (entering) Hey!

Monica: Ugh, I thought you were Rachel!

Chandler: (looking down) What gave me away?

Monica: I just tell her, I have to get it over with. I told Ross and Phoebe and sheâs the only one left!

Chandler: Okay, so thatâs it, everybody knows! Itâs official, weâre moving in together. No turning back. Are ya scared? Are ya?

Monica: No.

Chandler: Wow that was my scariest voice! Youâre very brave.

(They hug as Rachel enters.)

Rachel: Hey!

Chandler: Hey.

Rachel: Ugh, the worse day! Yâknow, you think youâre making progress at work and then your boss calls you Raquel.

Chandler: Hey listen, for the first four years of my work everybody called me Sha-la-lap. (Awkward silence ensues.) Seriously.

Rachel: I believe you. So, it was right in the middle of a staff meeting so of course no one else wants to correct her so everyone else is calling me Raquel! By the end of the day, the mailroom guys were calling me Rocky!

Chandler: Well, I-I still think youâre very-very nice and very prettyâ¦

Rachel: What?

Chandler: (To Monica) All yours babe. (Walks away.)

Monica: Have a seat. (They sit at the table.) Okay, listen umm, Chandler and I are going to live together, here.

Rachel: Oh my God! Thatâs so great! Iâm so happy for you guys!

Monica: Really?!

Rachel: And that was so sweet of you to ask! Oh my God, the three of us are gonna have such a good time living together!

Monica: Yes, we are. (Chandler is frantically trying to get Monica to correct her.)

Rachel: And Chandler, youâre gonna have to watch those long showers you take in the morning because you know Raquel canât be late.

Chandler: Rachâ¦

Monica: Yeah, heâs gonna work on that.

Rachel: Ohh! This is so exciting! Oh Godâ¦ (Gasps and starts to sing) Come and knock on my doorâ¦

Monica: (singing) Weâll be waiting for youâ¦

{Transciberâs note: Iâll finish that one for those of you who donât know what theyâre talking about. Where the towels are Hers and Hers and His, Threeâs Company too! Yeah, thatâs the theme song for Threeâs Company.}

Commercial Break

[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is hosting an impromptu roundtable discussion with Stephanie, Karin, and Meg about Rossâs three divorces.]

Ross: â¦once you know the stories, itâs not that bad. First marriage, wifeâs hidden sexuality, not my fault. Second marriage, said the wrong name at the altar, a little my fault. Third marriage, well they really shouldnât allow you to get married when youâre that drunk and have writing all over your face, Nevadaâs fault.

Phoebe: Okay, so what do you think ladies? Who wouldnât be interested? Who wouldnât want to date him?

Stephanie: Well the divorces donât bother me, Iâd date him. But, not while heâs still married.

Phoebe: Okay, what about you? (Points to Karin) Wouldnât you want a date?

Karin: Actually, Iâm dating at all anymore. See, I figured out that I was only dating guys that were like yâknow bad for me, so until I work that outâ¦

Phoebe: (interrupting) Whatever! What about you Meg?

Meg: Well, I donât care about the divorces either, but I wouldnât date him. Itâs just that heâs obviously still in love with this Rachel girl.

Ross: What?!

Phoebe: (leaning to him) She said, "Heâs obviously still in love with this Rachel girl." (He glares at her.)

Ross: This is crazy! I mean, yes-yes Rachel is my good friend and I-I have loved her in the past, but now, she is just my wife! Phoebe, will you-will you help me out here?

Phoebe: Well, I thought you loved her when you-when you married her.

Ross: We were drunk! I wouldâve married uh, Joey with that amount of alcohol!

Phoebe: Hey! You could do a lot worse than Joey Tribbiani!!

Ross: (to the panel) Look, Iâm sorry, but you guys are wrong. I just donât want to be divorced three times.

Phoebe: Yes, and now heâs using this three divorces reason because he wants to stay married to her because he loves her. I must say, "Well done!" Bravo Meg.

Ross: (getting up) Okay! Fine! Fine! If-if this is what you think, forget about the whole three divorce thing! Okay, I-Iâll go to my lawyerâs office right now and get this marriage annulled! Okay?! Because she means nothing to me! Nothâ(leans down to Megâs ear)âNothing!!

Meg: Okay now I wouldnât date you because you seem a little creepy.

Karin: I am so attracted to him right now.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Monica are still debating about how to tell Rachel that Chandlerâs moving in and sheâs moving out.]

Chandler: Okay, when are we gonna tell Rachel what is actually gonna happen?

Monica: Soon! I-I just couldnât before. You saw how upset Joey got! I couldnât do that to her, sheâs my best friend!

Chandler: Well, Joeyâs my best friend.

Monica: Iâm not your best friend?

Chandler: You just saidâ¦ Of course youâre my best friend. Would you please tell Rachel though?

Monica: All right, all right, at least Iâm prepared.

Chandler: Okay. (She grabs a tin of freshly baked cookies) Oh yes. (He reaches for one.)

Monica: (slapping his hand) Hey!

Chandler: Hey-hey!

Monica: These arenât for you! Are you upset?

Chandler: I am now!

Rachel: (entering) Hey roomie!

Chandler: Okay, bye! (Exits.)

Monica: Rach, thereâs something uh, important I have to tell you.

Rachel: (gasps) Are you pregnant?!

Monica: No! But, Iâm throwing this shirt away! I think there was a little misunderstanding before.

Rachel: Um-hmm.

Monica: Umm, when I said that uh, that Chandler and I wanted to umm, live together we meant alone together.

Rachel: (laughs) Oh my God! Oh, thatâs funny, I canât believe I did that.

Monica: Oh no sweetie, no! This is my fault, I wasnât clear! Iâm really sorry. And listen, you take as much time as you need to move out okay? Thereâs absolutely no rush.

Rachel: Okay. (Sits back and resumes her reading.)

Monica: Okay. Donât you want a cookie?

Rachel: Sure? (Monica hands her one.) Thanks.

Monica: Maybe, do you need a tissue?

(Rachel mumbles uh-huh and spits the half-eaten cookie out onto the tissue.)

Rachel: Monica, where did you get these?!

Monica: I made them!

Rachel: Ooh, good God, theyâre so yummy! (She re-ingests the previously expelled cookie matter from the tissue.)

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is packing some books and Joey is watching him.]

Joey: God, itâs gonna so weird like when I come home and youâre not here. Yâknow? No more Joey and Chanâs. No more J and Câs. "You wanna go over to Joey and Chandlerâs?" "Canât, its not there."

Chandler: Look, Iâm just gonna be across the hall, we can still do all the same stuff.

Joey: Yeah but we wonât be able to like get up in the middle of the night and have those long talks about our feelings and the future.

Chandler: Not once did we do that.

Monica: (entering) Hi.

Chandler: Hey!

Joey: Hi.

Monica: So I, I told Rachel it was just gonna be the two of us.

Chandler: Oh yeah? Well, howâd she take it?

Monica: Really well. Yeah. Surprisingly well. Yeah, she didnât cry. She wasnât angry or sad. (Sits down, slightly disgusted.)

Chandler: And youâre upset because you didnât make your best friend cry?

Monica: I mean, all Iâm asking for is just a little emotion! Is that too much to ask after six years?! I mean what? Are-are-are Rachel and I not as close as you guys?! I mean do we not have as much fun?! Donât I deserve a few tears?!! I mean we-we told Joey, he cried his eyes out!

Joey: Hey! I did not cry my eyes out!! Come on! Itâs like the end of an era! No more J-man and Channieâs!!

Chandler: Okay, I gotta ask, who calls us that?!

[Scene: Rossâs lawyerâs office, his name is Russell and has just been told by Ross about his current situation.]

Russell: You got married again.

Ross: Yes.

Russell: So thatâs your second marriage in two years.

Ross: Yes, second in two years. Third overall.

Russell: Ross, I have been a divorce attorney for 23 years and never had I so much business from one client. Why donât you tell me what happened.

Ross: Basically, Rachel and I were in Vegas and we got drunkâ¦

Russell: (interrupting) Iâm sorry, is this the same Rachel whoâs name you said at the altar in the second marriage?

Ross: Yes-yes-yes! But, I-I do not love her.

Russell: Oh, thatâs better then.

Ross: This was just a drunken mistake and I need to get it annulled.

Russell: I see. Have you considered therapy?

Ross: I think just the annulment for today.

Russell: There are a couple of forms to fill out.

Ross: Easy.

Russell: And weâll need to have witnesses who can testify that you were not of uh, sound mind.

Ross: No problem.

Russell: And weâll need you and Rachel to testify before a judge.

Ross: Ooh! Thereâs no way to do this without her? âCause I kinda all ready told her uh, it was, it was already taken care of.

Russell: Of course you did. Look Ross, you canât get an annulment unless you and Rachel are both there.

Ross: Uh-ha, what about someone who looks like Rachel? (Russell glares at him.) I will think about the therapy.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is painting her toe nails as Monica enters.]

Rachel: Hey!

Monica: Hey. So um, I was thinking that maybe we should start dividing up our stuff.

Rachel: Okay!

Monica: Yâknow, no point in dragging it out. Dragging out the long process of you moving out and us not living together anymore.

Rachel: Okay.

Monica: Hey Rach, what about this? (She holds up a chrome 5-point star.) Huh? Who-who gets this? See, I donât know if I want it because it might be yâknow, too many memories!

Rachel: (grabbing the star) What the hell is that?

Monica: I donât know. (Picks up a big plate from the coffee table.) Hey, Rachel, you want the big plate? I want you to have the big plate.

Rachel: Wow! Mon, thanks! I love this plate!

Monica: Something to remember me by!

Rachel: Mon, honey youâre not dying. Iâm just moving out. Yâknow, I mean weâre gonna see each other all the time.

Monica: But still, itâs a big change. The end of an era, you might say!

Rachel: Are you okay? Youâre not blinking.

Monica: Iâm fine! I just, Iâm thinking how much itâs an end of era.

Rachel: Oh, all right. But yâknow I gotta say, I donât, I donât think six years counts as an era.

Monica: An era is defined as a significant period of time. Now, it was significant to me, maybe it wasnât significant to you!

Rachel: What is the matter with you?!

Monica: What is the matter with you?!! Why arenât you more upset?! Arenât you gonna be sad that weâre not gonna be living together anymore?! I mean arenât you gonna miss me at all?!

Rachel: All right, fine, but donât get mad at me. Itâs-itâs just a little hard to believe.

Monica: Whatâs hard to believe?

Rachel: Well yâknow, itâs you guys. You-you do this kind of stuff! Yâknow? I mean, you-you were gonna get married in Vegas and then you backed out! I guess Iâm not upset because I donât see you guys going through with it. Iâm sorry.

Monica: Rachel, itâs going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here.

Rachel: But Iâ¦

Monica: No-no, wait! Just let me finish, okay? This isnât something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want. And it is going to happen.

Rachel: It is? Really?

Monica: Yeah, sweetie.

Rachel: (starting to lose her composure) I mean weâre not, weâre not gonna live together anymore?

Monica: No.

Rachel: What? Oh my God! Iâm gonna miss you so much! (Starts to cry.)

Monica: Iâm gonna miss you! (They hug.)

Rachel: I mean itâs the end of an era!

Monica: I know!

[Scene: The hallway, Ross is coming up the stairs as Phoebe leaves Joey and Chandlerâs.]

Phoebe: (to Joey and Chandler) Okay, bye!

Ross: Oh no.

Phoebe: So? Did you get the annulment?

Ross: I couldnât.

Phoebe: I knew it! Because you love Rachel.

Ross: Itâs not that. Okay? Annulments are more complicated than Iâ¦

Phoebe: Yeah, complicated âcause of the love.

Ross: Iâ¦ I do, I do not love Rachel. Iâm gonna tell her right now about the whole thing so we can get this marriage annulled as fast as possible. Okay? Would I do that if I loved her?

Phoebe: Iâve never been more convinced of your love for her.

Ross: I do not have feelings for Rachel! Okay?! (He goes into her apartment.)

[Cut to Monica and Rachelâs as Ross walks through the door. Rachel is holding the chrome star and crying.]

Ross: Ohh, whatâs wrong?!

Rachel: Monica and Chandler are really moving in here and I have to move out and everything is changing.

Ross: Oh myâCome here! Come here! (He hugs her.) Itâs okay. Everythingâs gonna be okay.

Rachel: Thank you.

Ross: Of course.

(Ross suddenly realizes something.)

Ending Credits

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Phoebe are talking.]

Joey: So, Ross and Rachel got married, Monica and Chandler almost got married, do you think you and I should hook up?

Phoebe: Oh we do, but not just yet.

Joey: Really?! Well, when?

Phoebe: Okay umm, well, first Chandler and Monica will get married and be filthy rich by the way. Yeah. But it wonât work out.

Joey: Wow.

Phoebe: I know. Then, Iâm gonna marry Chandler for the money and youâll marry Rachel and have the beautiful kids.

Joey: Great!

Phoebe: But then we ditch those two and thatâs when we get married. Weâll have Chandlerâs money and Rachelâs kids and getting custody will be easy because of Rachelâs drinking problem.

Joey: Oh-oh, what about Ross?

Phoebe: I donât want to go into the whole thing, but umm, we have words and I kill him.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Joey, Monica, and Phoebe are there as Chandler enters.]

Chandler: (entering) Hey!

Phoebe: Hey! Check it out! This is unbelievable! Joey has been holding his breath for almost four minutes!

(We see Joey who has puffed up his cheeks and Chandler nonchalantly reaches down and pinches Joeyâs nose shut. In a few seconds, Joey has to move because heâs now forced to actually hold his breath.)

Joey: (To Chandler) Dude! What are yoâyou trying to kill me?!

Rachel: (entering from her room) Pheebs, I wanna ask you something.

Phoebe: Uh-huh, what?

Rachel: Well since Iâm movinâ out and-and youâre so beautifulâ¦

Phoebe: Oh!

Rachel: â¦how about I move in with you?

Phoebe: Well, that would be great but then what do we do about Denise?

Monica: Whoâs Denise?

Phoebe: My roommate.

Rachel: You have a roommate?!

Phoebe: Yes, Denise. Denise!

Joey: Hey, what is with the secrecy Phoebe? Huh? And what about this Denise, is she cute?

Chandler: Pheebs, I donât understand. How can you have a roommate that none of us know anything about?

Phoebe: Maybe because you never listen to anything that I say. I talk about her all the time! DENISE!!!!!

Joey: Hey Rach, listen I was thinkinâ uh, Iâm gonna have an extra room over at my placeâ¦

Rachel: Oh, thatâs true.

Joey: Yeah, why donât you move in with me? Itâll be great! We could stay up late, watch movies, and you know about Naked Thursdayâs right?

Rachel: Yeah, yeah I think Iâm gonna find my own place.

Chandler: Hey-hey! I thought Naked Thursdayâs was just our thing man!

Opening Credits

[Scene: Central Perk, Ross is reading a magazine, eating a cookie, and drinking some coffee as Phoebe enters.]

Phoebe: Hey.

Ross: Hey!

Phoebe: So, what did Rachel say when you told her you were still married to her?

Ross: Oh, that. Umm, she took it really well.

Phoebe: You didnât tell her did you?

Ross: No.

Phoebe: Of course not, because youâre in love with her.

Ross: I am not in love with her. She was very upset about having to move out so I eh, didnât tell her we were still married because she would only get more upset. I-I just comforted her, as a friend.

Phoebe: What do you mean, comforted her?

Ross: Itâs nothing, I just gave her a hug.

Phoebe: Ah-ha! A classic sign of love, the hug!

Ross: Itâs also a sign of friendship.

Phoebe: Yeah, not in your case Lovey Loverson. (Tries to take a bite out of Rossâs cookie.)

Ross: (grabs back his cookie) It was a hug!

Phoebe: Okay, just tell me this, did you or did you not smell her hair?

Ross: S-s-smell her hair? What if I did?

Phoebe: Ninety percent of a womenâs pheromones come out the top of her head! Thatâs why, thatâs why women are shorter. So that men will fall in love when they hug them! (Ross is staring at her dumbfounded.) Oh come on Ross, youâre a scientist.

Ross: I was hugging her as a friend. Itâs not my fault her-her hair got in my face, sheâs got a lot of it and it smells all-all uhâ¦coconutty. (Phoebe raises her eyebrows.) What?! Oh, that doesnât mean I have feelings for Rachel! Maybe it means I have feelings for coconuts!

Phoebe: (taking his coffee) Okay, whatever you say. But just be careful, all right? Rachelâs not in the same place you are.

Ross: (grabbing back his coffee) If the place you are referring too is being in love, then she is in the same place as me because I am not in that place!

Phoebe: Okay, I didnât understand that, but yâknow, maybe thatâs âcause you were speaking the secret language of love!

(She goes for his magazine and he grabs it away before she reaches it. But she was only using the magazine as a decoy because she grabs his cookie and coffee, takes a bite out of the cookie and drinks some of the coffee.)

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler and Monica are there as Joey enters.]

Joey: Hey! (To Chandler) Dude, some guy just called for you.

Chandler: Who was it?

Joey: I donât know! How about, "Thanks for taking the message." Jeez! (Exits.)

Monica: Okay listen, yâknow when you move in Rachelâs room is gonna be empty, you wanna talk about what we want to do with it?

Chandler: Sure!

Monica: Okay, I was thinking we should have a beautiful guest room, right? With a mahogany sleigh bed and bedside tables with flowers on them all the time! And we could have a roll top desk with comment cards on them so people could say how much they loved staying here!! Okay, whatever, I really havenât thought about it that much.

Chandler: Well, I like that idea. Obviously! I was thinking maybe-maybe-maybe it could be a game room, yâknow? I mean you can buy old arcade games like uh, like Space Invaders and Asteroids for $200, the real ones! The big-big ones!

Monica: No.

Chandler: Okay so you mean no as in, "Gee Chandler, what an interesting idea. Letâs discuss it before we reject it completely."

Monica: Oh, Iâm sorry. Of course I mean that. Interesting idea, umm, talk about it, but no.

Chandler: So, thatâs it?

Monica: I just donât think arcade games go in the beautiful guest room. The beautiful guest room is gonna be filled with antiques.

Chandler: Which is why Asteroids is perfect! Itâs the oldest game!

Monica: What do you have against the beautiful guest room?

Chandler: I donât have anything against the beautiful guest room, especially since everybody we know lives about 30 seconds away!

Monica: Are you mocking me?

Chandler: No, Iâm not mocking you, (in a mocking voice) or you beautiful guest room. (Exits.)

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler is coming from across the hall.]

Joey: Hey, whatâs up?

Chandler: Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight.

Joey: But youâre still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today. (Shows him the paper.)

Chandler: (reading the ad) "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Nice!

Joey: Yeah? I just figured yâknow, after living with you itâd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, yâknow? Someone I can learn from, someone-someone whoâs different than me. And whatâs more different than me; a guy whoâs not 19 than say a girl who is 19? Enh? (Points to his head.) Not just a hat rack my friend!

[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is on the couch staring off into space as Rachel enters.]

Rachel: Pheebs, I have to ask youâ¦

Phoebe: Shhhhhh! Iâm swamped right now.

Rachel: Youâre just staring into space.

Phoebe: Umm, Iâm trying to move that pencil. (Thereâs a pencil lying on the table.)

Rachel: This one? (Picks it up.)

Phoebe: It worked!

Rachel: Pheebs, this whole apartment thing is just a nightmare! Every place I can afford comes with a roommate who is a freak. I mean, look at this; (Points to one and starts to read it.) "Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly." Itâs just, there is nothing! The cityâs full!

Phoebe: Wait, no, look at this! (Points to one.) (Reading) "Two bedroom, two bath, must be non-smoker, Satan worshipers okayâ¦" Oh, yeah, but itâs on the ground floor.

Ross: (entering) Hey!

Rachel: Hey.

Ross: Rach, uh, you still looking for a place?

Rachel: Yeah! Why?

Ross: Okay, thereâs this guy, Warren, from the museum and heâs going on a dig for like two years and heâs got this great place he needs to sublet. So uh, you interested?

Rachel: That sounds great! Iâd love to live at Warrenâs!! I love Warren! Thank you!

Ross: Donât thank me! If you wanna thank something, thank the volcano that erupted thousands of years ago, killing but perfectly preserving an entire civilization. (Rachel just looks at him.) Hereâs Warrenâs number.

Rachel: Oh, this is great! I am gonna call him right now! (Jumps up.) Oh, thank you!

(She hugs him and he starts to hug her back but notices the look Phoebe is giving him and pushes her away.)

Ross: Okay, you go grab it!

Phoebe: I saw it.

Ross: I donât know what youâre talking about.

Phoebe: Umm, Iâm talking about that which you already know but wonât admit. You love her again; you re-love her!

Ross: Look, I do not re-love her.

Phoebe: I canât believe you wonât just admit it! (Pause) Okay, just promise me that you wonât do anything stupid.

Ross: Look, weâre just friends now! Okay? Why would I do anything stupid?

Rachel: (returning from calling Warren) Ugh!!! Well, the apartment is already subletted! I mean, this is just hopeless. Iâm never gonna find anything.

Ross: You can live with me.

Rachel: What?!

Phoebe: What?!

Ross: What?

Commercial Break

[Scene: Central Perk, continued from earlier.]

Rachel: Oh my God! Are you serious?!

Ross: Uh-huh. (Phoebe grunts.)

Rachel: I would love to live with you Ross; thatâs-thatâs great! Thank you!

Ross: Well, Iâm-Iâm just glad I could, yâknow, help you out.

Phoebe: Wow! Iâm-Iâm so happy for you guys. (To Ross) This is so-so, not stupid.

Rachel: Ross-Ross, you have no idea what this means to me! I mean, I mean I was gonna be homeless. You just saved me! Youâre my hero!

Ross: Hero, I uh, I donât knowâwell, all right.

Rachel: Oh, I have to go tell Monica what a wonderful brother she has! (Kisses him on the cheek and exits.)

Ross: Oh please! (He sits down.) (To Phoebe) Youâre gonna say things now, arenât ya?

Phoebe: No. No, I wonât. But I should tell you this, this exact same thing happened to my roommate Denise. She moved in with a guy who was secretly married to her and he said he didnât love her, but he really did, and it just blew up! And thatâs how she ended up living with me! (Ross looks at her.) (Pause) Okay, thatâs a lie.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is in the kitchen as Chandler enters.]

Chandler: Hi.

Monica: Hi.

Chandler: Hi, listen, Iâm sorry about before. I donât need to have a game room. I mean when I was a kid I only played those games because I couldnât get girls, and now I can âemâNow, I have you. (Monica glares at him.) Not-not that I think that I have you or think of you as property in any sort of way, I see womenâ¦

Monica: Stop it Chandler. (Chandler is relieved) Iâm sorry too.

Chandler: Really?

Monica: Yeah! Oh yes!

Chandler: Ohh.

Monica: Listen, we donât have to make that a guest room, we can think of something to do with the room together.

Chandler: Thatâs a great idea! We can easily think of a way for us both to enjoy the room.

Monica: Totally!

(They start thinking.)

Chandler: We donât have to come up with this now.

Monica: Oh good.

Chandler: Hey, yâknow what? Why donât we think about changes we can make in the living room?

Monica: Changes?

Chandler: Yeah, I mean weâre gonna have to move around some furniture to make room for my chair. (Kisses her and heads into the living room.)

Monica: Youâre-youâre-youâre gonna bring the Barca Lounger over here?

Chandler: Is that a problem?

Monica: Well, itâs a set and they should probably stay together.

Chandler: Oh, thatâs cool. Then Iâll just bring them both over.

Monica: See now-now youâre taking them away from their home.

Chandler: Okay, I get it. So, I get nothing! Nothing here is mine! Everything here is yours! Iâll get up in the morning put on your clothes, and head off to work!

Monica: Yeah-yeah, yâknow what? Yeah, thatâs it-thatâs it, everything will be mine! Nothing will be yours! Thatâs-thatâs what I said! Oh come on, Chandler! Iâm talking about the barca lounger! It just, it doesnât match! Where is it gonna go?!

Chandler: In the game room!

Monica: Look it is not my fault that your chairs are incredibly ugly!

Chandler: All right! Thatâs fine! Thatâs fine! I wonât bring over the chairs! I wonât bring anything over! I wouldnât want to ruin the ambiance over here at Grandmaâs place!! (Storms out.)

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is interviewing a potential roommate. And yes, sheâs a female, non-smoker and very non-ugly.]

Joey: (exiting from Chandlerâs room with the new roommate) Everything on your application looks really goodâOhh! Just one last question umm, are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out?

The Potential Roommate: Oh donât worry, Iâm not really a party girl.

Joey: Whoa!! Now look, donât be just blurtinâ stuff out. I want you to really think about your answers. Okay?

Chandler: (entering) You can call off the roommate search! (To the potential roommate) Hi! Iâll be living here. (Heads for the bathroom.)

Joey: Oh donât listen to him, heâs just some guy who really wants the apartment, but I donât think heâs gonna get it.

Chandler: Why did you take the shower curtain down?

Joey: That thing was a hazard! (To the potential roommate) Iâm very safety conscious.

[Scene: Rossâs Apartment, Rachel is entering and Ross is making some room on the shelves for his stuff.]

Rachel: Hey!

Ross: Hey! Oh listen, I was just clearing some space for your stuff.

Rachel: Oh thanks, but listen, I was just at Monicaâs and she and Chandler had a big fight and theyâre not moving in.

Ross: What do you mean, theyâre not moving in? They-theyâre still moving in right?

Rachel: No-no, they just had a big blowout over what to do with my room.

Ross: What?! Over a stupid room!

Rachel: Yeah, I feel kinda bad for them, but Iâm also really psyched âcause I donât have to move in here!

Ross: Oh no, yeah no, that partâs great!

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Ross is entering, dragging Chandler, to mediate the argument between Chandler and Monica.]

Ross: Whatâs all this about you guys fighting?! Is this really over a room?! I mean, that is so silly!

Monica: Ross, we can handle this.

Ross: Well, apparently not, and I canât just stand by and watch two people I care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly. I mean, enough of the silliness!

Chandler: Well, why donât you tell her to stop being silly! (Monica mocks him and he joins in.)

Ross: (stopping them) Okay-okay! Two very good points, look Iâve known you both a long time, and Iâve never seen either of you one/millionth as happy as youâve been since youâve got together. Do you really want to throw that all away over a room? That is so silly. Now wh-what is more important, love or silliness?

Chandler: Well, we are fond of the silliness, but we also have a soft spot for the love.

Monica: Love is the best medicine.

Chandler: Thatâs laughter.

Monica: Why do you do it?

Chandler: I donât know.

Ross: Okay! All right! Now, Chandler you-you wanna live with Monica, right?

Chandler: Yeah, I do.

Ross: And Mon, you wanna live with Chandler, donât ya?

Monica: Yes.

Ross: (jumping up) Good! A verbal contract is binding in the state of New York! (Storms out.)

[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is sitting at the counter waiting for Gunther, yep Guntherâs back, to refill her coffee.]

Gunther: So I understand youâre looking for a place.

Rachel: No-no, Iâm staying put.

Gunther: Oh, I was going to offer you my apartment.

Rachel: Why, where are you going?

Gunther: I donât know.

Ross: (entering) Hey Rach!

Rachel: Hi!

Ross: Youâre never gonna believe it uh, Monica and Chandler are moving in again. Thatâs great news rightâI mean for them. Right?

Rachel: Oh wow.

Ross: Yeah but, on the bright side, we get to be roommates again.

Rachel: Yeah. Yâknow umm, uh, umm, about that, umm, Ross I really appreciate your offer to let me move in and everything, but donât you think itâs gonna be weird?

Ross: Wh-why?! Why-why-why would it, why would it be weird?

Rachel: Well, because of us! Because of our history.

Ross: No!

Rachel: No?

Ross: No! No! It would be weird if we were still in that place, I mean are you still in that place?

Rachel: No! Not at all!

Ross: Good! Me neither! So itâs not a problem. Weâre just two friends who happen to be roommates.

Rachel: Okay, but Ross, eventually you and I are gonna be dating.

Ross: Really?! We are?

Rachel: Yeah! Iâm gonna have a boyfriend, youâre gonna have a girlfriendâ¦

Ross: Ohh! That would be great.

Rachel: But yâknow what, if you think itâs gonna be okay weâll just work out a system. Yâknow, itâll be like college, Iâll hang a hanger on the door and put a sign, "Come back later, Iâm gettinâ lucky." (Laughs.)

Ross: (laughs as well, but for a different reason) Yeah, I didnât think of that.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is once again being dragged in by Ross so he that he can try to manipulate the situation so that itâs best for Ross, not necessarily whatâs best for Monica and Chandler.]

Ross: So are you sure about this whole moving in thing?! I mean itâs a really big step! And-and whatâs the rush?!

(They both start laughing at him.)

Monica: Thatâs very funny!

Chandler: Heâs being silly, because he knows that we enjoy the silliness!

Ross: No, I-I-Iâm serious, okay? I mean, think about it. You move in, you start fighting over stupid game rooms, next thing yâknow you break up!

Monica: Ross, you were right before, it was just a stupid fight about a room.

Ross: Okay, there are no stupid fights!! This isnât about the room, this is about what the roomâ¦represents! And unfortunately, this room (Points to Rachelâs room) could destroy you!!

Chandler: Yeah, I'm not so worried.

Monica: Yeah, no, me neither.

Ross: Fine! Itâs your life! (Starts to storm out mad about his failed attempt at the manipulation of his best friend and sister, but stops and tries one last time.) I just donât want to see you guys break up! Which you will do if you move in together, (Monica and Chandler just stare at him.) but thatâs what you want, thereâs nothing I can do. (Opens the door and tries one more time.) DONâT DO IT!!!!! (Finally leaves.)

Monica: You still want to move in together right?

Chandler: Of course!

Monica: Ross didnât scare you?

Chandler: Scared me out of ever wanting to live with him.

Monica: Come here, I want to show you something!

Chandler: Okay!

(They run to the living room where Monica has moved the chair back (Towards the step), the coffee table forward (Towards the TV), and taped a square outline on the floor.)

Chandler: Oh my God! Someoneâs killed Square Man!

Monica: This is where I thought the barca lounger could go! You see you could see the TV and itâs still walking distance to the kitchen.

Chandler: Oh thatâs so sweet! I want to show you something too!

Monica: Okay!

Chandler: Yâknow those big-big uh, road signs that say "Merge?"

Monica: Uh-hmm.

Chandler: Yâknow? So I was thinking that we could get one of those signs and hang it over our bed. Because, thatâs you and I together! Merge!

Monica: Oh my God! I love that!

Chandler: Really?!

Monica: Uh, no!!

[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is singing a new song. Yep, the first new Phoebe song of season six, Ross, Joey, and Rachel are also there.]

Phoebe: (singing) I found you in my bed!
                          Howâd you whined up there?
                          You are a mystery!
                          Little black curly hair!
                          Little black curly hair!
                          Little black, little black, little black, little black, little black curly hairâ¦â¦â¦â¦

(Applause.)

Phoebe: Now if you want to receive e-mails about my upcoming shows, then please give me money so I can buy a computer.

Ross: (To Rachel) So umm, where are the other guys?

Rachel: Umm, well letâs see Monica and Chandler are occupied.

Ross: Fighting?!

Rachel: No, the other thing. I really think itâs great they work things out.

Ross: Yeah. Thereâs no breaking them up, is there?

Rachel: Hey, can I borrow the key to your house so I can run across the street and make a copy?

Ross: Sure! Here. (Hands her his keys.)

Rachel: Thank you. (Gets up) Now are you sure? Because once I make a copy, thereâs no turning back.

Ross: Yeah, Iâm-Iâm sure. (Deadpan) Yeah, get out of here before I change my mind. (She exits)

Joey: Umm, listen, Ross do you really think this moving in with Rachel is a good idea?

Ross: Iâve been back and forth.

Joey: Yeah well, maybe you should go back! Okay? Rachel moves in, and before you know it youâre right where you donât want to be! Back together!

Ross: Ehh, I donât, I donât think so. Sheâs already talked about yâknow, dating other guys.

Joey: Thatâs not gonna work out! Then sheâs gonna come home all weepy and youâll be tellinâ her, "Oh thatâs okay. Youâll find someone." And then, bamn! She finds you!

Ross: Yeah, well, m-maybe youâre right.

Joey: I am telling you Ross, she is definitely gonna fall in love with you again! Now, is that what you want?

Ross: Is that what I want?

Phoebe: (on the microphone, accidentally) Yes.

(Rachel enters.)

Joey: Here she comes. Hold on, Iâm gonna make your life much easier.

Rachel: All right, well the place was closed. Iâll just copy it later.

Joey: Or not. Uh, Rach, why donât you just move in with me? (Rachel sighs.)

Ross: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, Joey!

Joey: No-no-no-no-no-no-no-noâ¦ Itâs okay, I mean Iâlook Rach, I know I scared you off with that whole Naked Thursdayâs thing, but we donât have to do that!

Rachel: Well, it would be easier to move just right across the hall. Wait a minute, unless youâre thinking about Naked Wednesdayâs.

Joey: Thursdayâs clearly not good for ya, pick a day!

Commercial Break

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey has The Potential Roommate back for another interview.]

Joey: (opening the door to The Potential Roommate) Hi!

The Potential Roommate: Hi!

Joey: Come in. Thanks for cominâ back, umm, okay there have been a lot of people interested in the room, but I have narrowed it down and you are one of the finalists!

The Potential Roommate: Great!

Joey: Okay now, before I make my final decision I uh, I just want to make sure our personalities match. Okay, so I made up a little test. Now, Iâm gonna say a word and then you say the first thing that comes to mind.

The Potential Roommate: I can do that.

Joey: Okay! Here we go. Pillow.

The Potential Roommate: Fight.

The Potential Roommate: String?

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Rachel is packing her belongings to move to Rossâs. Sheâs standing in the kitchen.]

Rachel: So, which of this kitchen stuff is mine?

Monica: This bottle opener. (She grabs it off of the freezer door.)

Rachel: And?

Monica: And itâs a magnet!

Rachel: Look at that!

Ross: How weird is that? Yâknow? Youâre moving in with me and have the one thing I donât have. Itâs like uh, in a way you-you complete me (Phoebe glares at him) kitchen.

Rachel: What?!

Ross: (in an Australian accent) You complete me kitchen, matey!

Phoebe: Ross, I know what youâre thinking.

Ross: What?

Phoebe: That sheâs gonna move in with you and maybe then sheâll fall in love with you and then when she finds out youâre already married, sheâll just be happy. Yâknow? Youâre just, youâre very sad.

Ross: Ohâ¦myâ¦God! I-I see what this is! You are in love with Rachel!

Phoebe: What?!!

Ross: Of course! It all adds up! I mean you youâre obsessed with her. Itâs always, "Ross, what are you gonna do about Rachel?" "Ross, why-why are you moving in with Rachel?" "When are you gonna confess your secret marriage to Rachel?" You want her!

Phoebe: No! (Rossâs phone rings.)

Ross: (answering it) Uh-oh, saved by the bell. (On phone) Hello?

[Cut to the living room where Monica is helping pack a box.]

Monica: Hey Rach, arenât these candlesticks (holds up a pair) mine?

Rachel: No-no, I bought those.

Monica: Ohh! Yeah, I forgot.

Rachel: Yeah. (Rachel walks away.)

Monica: (under her breath) That youâre a liar. (Hides the candlesticks in a drawer.)

Ross: (on phone) No-no-no, thatâs great! Iâll be there Monday. And thank you again! (Listens) Okay. (Hangs up) (To All) Umm, that was the head of the Paleontology department at N uh, Y, uh U!

Monica: Wow! Uh what, did he uh, say?

Ross: Well remember that paper I had published last year on sediment flow rate, huh? They loved it.

Rachel: Well, who wouldnât?!

Ross: I know! Anyway, they asked me to be a guest lecturer! I mean itâs temporary, but uh, if they like me it could lead to a full time job. How great would that look great on a mailbox, huh? "Professor Geller."

Phoebe: Yeah, Professor and Mrs.

Rachel: And Mrs.?!

Phoebe: Oh! Yeah, yâknow you and Ross are still married.

Rachel: What?!!

Phoebe: Just kidding!

Rachel: Ohh! Oh God! (Laughs her way into the living room.)

Opening Credits

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Monica, Rachel, and Chandler are all there as Phoebe enters dejectedly.]

Chandler: Hey!

Phoebe: Hi.

Monica: Hey!

Chandler: Oh, whatâs the matter?

Phoebe: Well, you know that psychic I see?

Chandler: Yeah?

Phoebe: Well, she told me that Iâm gonna die this week, so Iâm kinda bummed about that.

Chandler: What?!

Phoebe: Yeah, and I know you guys donât know a lot about psychic readings, but that one is pretty much the worse one you can get.

Monica: Phoebe thatâs crazy!

Joey: I canât believe she would say that too you.

Rachel: Yeah honey you donât believe her do you?

Phoebe: I donâtâshe said yâknow that Iâd have triplets! But she also said one of them would be black.

Chandler: Just out of curiosity did she tell you how youâre gonna go?

Phoebe: No, âcause she didnât tell me I was gonna die until the very end of the session, and I was not gonna waste a whole another hour there! I mean Iâve only got a week left, yâknow? Iâve really gotta start living now! (So she picks up the latest copy of Car and Driver (a U.S. auto magazine), leans back, and starts reading.)

Ross: (entering) Hey everyone!

Chandler: Oh hi!

Ross: Hey uh, well, todayâs my first lecture and I kinda wanted to try it out on you guys, do you, do you mind?

(They pause to think about it.)

All: Oh thatâd be great. Sure!

Ross: (he starts reading directly from his cards word for word very quietly) "There are three primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. Each of these theories can be further subcategorized into two distinctâ¦"

Phoebe: Oh, this is it. This whatâs gonna kill me.

Ross: (continuing) "â¦subcategories. The first of these subcategories isâ¦"

Joey: (interrupting him) Uh Ross! Are there uh, are there naked chicks on that piece of paper?

Ross: No! Why?

Joey: Well, Iâve just never seen a guy stare so hard at a piece of paper that didnât have naked chicks on it.

Ross: Ohh! Okay! Okay. (Resumes reading word for word from the card) "There are three (pauses and looks at Joey) primary theories concerning sediment flow rate. (Pauses and darts his eyes between Chandler and Rachel.) (Rachel starts laughing) Each of these theories (glances at Phoebe) can be further subcategorized (glances at Chandler) intoâ¦"

Chandler: Why donât you open with a joke?

Ross: Open with a joke? Itâs a university, not a comedy club!

Chandler: Wait a minute, hold the phone! Youâre not talking about Chuckles University?!

Ross: (gets up) Okay!

All: Ohh! Weâre kidding! Oh, weâre kidding!

Rachel: Ross, hey you know what might make it less boring?

Ross: Thank you!

Rachel: Some uh, some visual aides.

Joey: Oh-ooh-ooh! Yâknow whatâs a good visual aide?

Ross: Please donât say naked chicks.

Joey: Why not?!

Ross: I-I-I donât even know why I bother to talk to you guys about it. Yâknow what? Iâm just gonna do it on my own with no naked chicks.

Chandler: Thatâs the way I did it âtil I was 19.

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is playing that string game with the two hands and the weird crossing patterns as Chandler enters with the mail.]

Chandler: Hey.

Joey: Hey! Any good mail?

Chandler: Yes, you got something from the Screen Actorâs Guild.

Joey: Ooh, itâs probably a residual check, hey can you open it for me, Iâm kindaâ¦.

Chandler: (opens and reads it) "Benefits lapsed."

Joey: Hmm thatâs weird. I donât remember being in a move called benefits lapsed.

Chandler: Okay, itâs not a check. Theyâre saying your health insurance expired because, you didnât work enough last year.

Joey: Let me see that!

Chandler: All right.

Joey: (reads it) Oh, I canât believe this! This sucks! When I had insurance I could get hit by a bus or catch on fire, yâknow? And it wouldnât matter. Now I gotta be careful?!

Chandler: Iâm sorry man, thereâs never a good time to (pauses) stop catching on fire.

Joey: All right well, I guess I gotta go get a job. Iâm gonna go see my agent.

Chandler: Okay, make sure you look both ways before you cross the street.

Joey: (mocks him, in a whiney voice) â¦look both ways before you cross the street. (Turns and walks headlong into the closed door.)

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe enters to find Rachel still packing.]

Phoebe: Hey!

Rachel: Hey Pheebs, youâre still alive! How are you doing?

Phoebe: Ugh, itâs so exhausting waiting for death. Ohh, by the way, do you think you couldâ(Groans, hacks, and then freezes with her eyes open and her tongue hanging out.)

Rachel: Pheebs, what-what are you doing?

Phoebe: I was preparing you for myâdidnât you think I was dead? Did that not come off?

Rachel: Oh yeah, scared the hell out of me. I thought weâd lost you forever. Pheebs, you lie down?

Phoebe: Yeah, thanks. And listen, can you do me a favor? Could you just umm, wake me up in a couple hours, yâknow if you can.

(Phoebe goes and lies down as Rachel opens the drawer Monica hid the candlesticks in and as Monica walks out of her room.)

Rachel: Monica!

Monica: Hmm? (Rachel holds up the candlesticks.)

Rachel: Did-did you take these back?

Monica: No-no, I-I just, I liked them so much that I went out and bought some for myself.

Rachel: Oh yeah, theyâre really great! Arenât they?

Monica: I loved them!

Rachel: Yeah. (Monica walks away) Nice try! (Rachel puts them in a box.)

Ross: (entering) Hello!

Monica: Hey!

Rachel: Hey!

Monica: Howâd the lecture go?

Ross: It went great! And I didnât need any jokes or naked chicks either!

Rachel: Wow, thatâs great Ross, Iâm sorry we werenât more supportive before.

Ross: I knew all I had to do was let the material speak for itself. Everyoneâs all, "Ross you have to be funny and sexy." Well, I proved them wrong! And now, Iâm gonna pass the news onto Joey and Chandler.

Monica: That youâre not funny or sexy?

Ross: Thatâs right!

[Scene: Estelle Leonard Theatrical Agency, Joey is there to see his agent.]

Joey: (entering) Hey Estelle, listenâ¦

Estelle: Well! Well! Well! Joey Tribbiani! So you came back huh? They think they can do better but they all come crawling back to Estelle!

Joey: What are you talkinâ about? I never left you! Youâve always been my agent!

Estelle: Really?!

Joey: Yeah!

Estelle: Oh well, no harm, no foul.

Joey: Estelle, you gotta get me some work. I-I lost my health insurance.

Estelle: All right, first thing we gotta do, damage control.

Joey: Why?

Estelle: Well, I think uhh, someone out there may have been bad mouthing you all over town.

Joey: Bastard!

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Chandler enters to find Joey lying in the fetus position on the floor.]

Chandler: Hey!

Joey: (in obvious pain) Hey! So Estelle lined up a bunch of auditions for me tomorrow and Iâll have my health insurance back in no time.

Chandler: Thatâs great, but shouldnât you be on the toilet right now?

Joey: What?!

Chandler: Whatâs wrong with you?

Joey: Nothing! Well, I-I got this blinding pain in my stomach when I was lifting weights before, then I uh passed out and uh, havenât been able to stand up since. But um, I donât think itâs anything serious.

Chandler: This sounds like a hernia. You have toâyou-you go to the doctor!

Joey: No way! âKay look, if I have to go to the doctor for anything itâs gonna be for this thing sticking out of my stomach! (Rolls over and shows Chandler.)

Chandler: Thatâs a hernia.

Joey: Why did I have to start working out again? (Looks at the weights he was using.) Damn you 15s!

[Scene: a NYU lecture hall, Rachel and Monica are arriving to talk to Ross after the lecture, but are there early.]

Rachel: Well, weâre a little early, the lecture doesnât end for 15 minutes.

Monica: Yeah, but yâknow we could sneak in and watch.

Rachel: Yeah, we could. Oh hey look! Thereâs some Kappa Kappa Deltas! I was a Kappa. (to them) Hey sisters! (They ignore her.) (To Monica) Wow, we really are bitches.

(They enter the lecture hall to find Ross speaking in an English accent for some unknown reason.)

Ross: (to the class) Right! So when Rigby got his samples back from the laboratory he made a startling discovery! What he believed to be igneous, was in fact sedimentary. Imagine his consternation whenâ(sees Monica and Rachel.) Oh bloody hell.

Commercial Break

[Scene: a NYU lecture hall, the scene is continued from earlier, only Ross has dismissed the class and is now talking to Monica and Rachel.]

Monica: What the hell are you doing?!

Ross: Look, I was nervous! You guys had me all worried I was going to be boring! I got up there and they were all like staring at me. I opened my mouth and this British accent just came out.

Rachel: Yeah, and not a very good one.

Ross: Will you-will you please?

(Another professor walks down from the back of the lecture hall.)

The Professor: Dr. Geller, Kurt Rathman, Iâm a professor in the paleontology department here.

Ross: Oh.

The Professor: Do you have a moment to talk about your lecture?

Ross: (in his British accent) Iâm sorry, Iâve got plans with my sister.

Monica: (in an Irish accent) Monica Gellerrr. (She rolls her âRâ)

Ross: (in accent) Right, will you excuse us for one moment? (Takes Monica aside.) (In his normal voice.) What are you doing?

Monica: (normal voice) Oh, you can have an accent and I canât?! (To an exiting student in accent.) Top âO the morning to ya laddies!

Ross: Just please stop!

(They turn back to Rachel and Professor Rathman.)

Rachel: (in an Indian accent) Yes, yes, Bombay is bery, bery nice time of year.

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is reading on the couch while Joey, still suffering from his hernia, is returning with coffee for them both. After a series of grunts and groans he manages to painfully walk back from the counter, sit down, and slide Chandler his coffee.]

Chandler: Hey, will you grab me a cruller? (Joey starts to groan and get up.) Sit down! Will you go to the hospital?!

Joey: Dude! Hernia operations cost like, a lot probably. Besides itâs getting darker and more painful, that means itâs healing.

Chandler: I will loan you the money. Just go to the hospital and letâs just get that thingâ¦pushed back in.

Joey: Thank you, but it would take me forever to pay you that money back and I donât want that hanging over my head. Okay? Besides, as soon as my insurance kicks in I can get all the free operations I want! Yeah, Iâm thinking Iâll probably start with that laser eye surgery too.

(Phoebe enters.)

Phoebe: Hey!

Chandler: Hey.

Joey: Hey!

Phoebe: Whatâs going on?

Chandler: Oh Joeyâs got a really bad hernia, but thatâs nothing a little laser eye surgery wonât fix!

Joey: Look, Iâm telling you if I put my hand on my stomach right here (He puts his hand down his pants, like Al Bundy on Marriedâ¦With Children always used to do.) it doesnât hurt that bad.

Phoebe: Hey! Maybe youâll die!

Joey: Sure, now Iâm scared.

Phoebe: No, we can go together! Just donât wait too long though, okay? âCause Iâm outta here sometime before Friday.

Joey: Yeah, but I donât wanna die!

Phoebe: No-no, itâll be fun! We can come back and we can haunt these guys!

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are having a tug-of-war over the disputed candlesticks.]

Monica: Gimme âem!

Rachel: No! They are mine!

Monica: You stole them from me!

Rachel: You stole them from me!!

Monica: Gimme them!

(With one last mighty tug the combatants lose their grip and split, each holding one candlestick.)

Monica: You just wanna each take one?

Rachel: Yeah that seems fair. We never use them.

Ross: (entering) Look, I really need some help, okay? Why? Why did I have to speak in a British accent?! What do I do?

Rachel: Wellâ¦

Monica: Why donât you phase it out? Yeah, fade the accent out and people will think youâre, yâknow, that youâre adjusting to life in America.

Rachel: Yeah, I mean, come on Ross, no one will even notice. I mean theyâre probably not even listening!

Ross: Theyâre not listening too me?

Rachel: Of course theyâre listening to you! Everybody listens to you.

Ross: Monica you really think I should try this phasing out thing?

Monica: I think you look fine.

[Scene: Casting Director #1âs office, Joey is on his first audition. His partner is an 8-year-old boy.]

Casting Director #1: Whenever youâre ready.

Joey: (in a gravely, painful voice) Okay. "Hey, Timmy, Iâve got a surprise for you."

Casting Director #1: Hold it. Iâm sorry, the surprise is a new swing set, if you could play it a little lessâ¦intense?

Joey: Oh yeah, sure, no problem, Iâll justâhold on one second. (He turns around and puts his hand in his pants and groans in relief.) (In a relaxed voice.) "Hey Timmy, Iâve got a surprise for you!"

Casting Director #1: Oh my God!!

(Joey pulls his hand out and reverts back to intense pain.)

[Scene: Casting Director #2âs office, Joey is on his second audition. This one is for Purina One Dog Chow, an actual item. Please note the gratuitous product placement.]

Joey: So thatâs why I feed my dog Purina One! Pick up a bag today! (He turns, looks at the bag and realizes he wonât be able to pick it up.)

Casting Director #2: Thatâs where you pick up the bag.

Joey: Exactly.

Casting Director #2: No, the line is pick a bag, so you need to pick up the bag.

Joey: Or, I could just point to it! Huh? Blah, blah, blah, Purina One, point to a bag today. (She just looks at him.) I didnât get it, did I?

Casting Director #2: No.

Joey: Yeah, okay. (Leaves)

[Scene: Casting Director #3âs office, Joey is entering.]

Joey: Hi. Iâm Joey Tribbiani; Iâm here to audition for (Groans) man.

Joey: Yes!

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica and Rachel are playing phone pranks on Ross.]

Monica: Okay, come on, do it one more time!

Rachel: Really? Really?!

Monica: Yes!

Rachel: Okay! (Picks up the phone and starts dialing.) (In an Irish accent) "Hello Ross, this is Dr. McNeeley from the Fake Accent University, weâd like you to come on board with us full time! (Hangs up.)

Phoebe: (entering) Hey!

Rachel: Hey!

Phoebe: Listen to this! My reading was wrong, Iâm not going die!

Rachel: Really?! How do you know?

Phoebe: Because my psychic is dead! She mustâve read the cards wrong!

Rachel: Oh, Iâm sorry.

Phoebe: Eh, better her than me! Hey, letâs bake cookies!

[Scene: Silvercup Studios, Joey has won the part of dying man and is now able to play the role he was injured for. Chandler is helping to carry him in.]

Chandler: Listen, Iâm really glad you got the part.

Joey: (barely audible through the pain) Thank you.

Chandler: But are you sure you can do this?

Joey: Yeah! And hey, thanks for coming with me. And thanks again for helping me take a shower.

(Chandler steps away quickly.)

Chandler: Now, is that never talking about it again?!

Joey: (to the director) Hiya!

The Director: Hey Joey, weâre ready for ya! (Joey stumbles over) Joey, this is Alex heâs going to be playing your son.

Joey: Hi Alex! (to the director) And uh, as you can see my hands are not in my pants. (Holds them both up.)

The Director: Okay. (to Alex) All right uh, Alex now when Joey says his line, "Take good care of your Momma son," thatâs your cue to cry. Got it? (Alex nods yes.) All right, letâs do this.

(Joey lies down on the gurney.)

A Crew Member: (with that board thingy) Scene 5, take 1.

The Director: And Action!

Joey: "Take could care of your Momma son." (Alex just looks at him and the director motions for him to continue so he tries it again.) "Take could care of your Momma son." (Alex does nothing.) "Come on son! Your Mommaâs good people!"

The Director: Cut! Alex, remember youâre supposed to cry. Can you cry for us this time?

Alex: Okay.

The Director: All right, from the top.

A Crew Member: Scene 5, take 2.

[Time lapse.]

A Crew Member: Take 36 is up!

The Director: All right! Letâs try this again! You ready Joe?

Joey: Ah, just one thing umm, is it all right with you if I, if I scream right up until you say action?

The Director: Uh sure.

Joey: Okay. (Starts screaming.)

The Director: Action!

Joey: (he stops screaming at action) "Take good care of your Momma son." (Again Alex does nothing.)

The Director: Cut!!!!!!!!!! (Joey starts screaming again.)

(Chandler decides to help out.)

Chandler: Iâm sorry! Hey-hey Joe, why donât you uh, lift up your shirt? (He does.) Take a look at this kiddo. (Alex finally starts crying.) We have a crying child! Roll the damn cameras!

[Scene: Ross and Rachelâs apartment, Rachel is unpacking as the phone rings.]

Rachel: (answering it) Hello?

Russell: (Rossâs divorce lawyer.) Hello, is Ross there?

Rachel: Uh no, heâs not. Can I take a message?

Russell: Yes, this Russell, Rossâs divorce lawyer, just tell him that since I havenât heard from him, I assume heâs decided to give the marriage a try.

Rachel: Ross got married againâNooooooo!!!!!!!!!

[Scene: a NYU lecture hall, Ross is trying to phase out his accent.]

Ross: (in his head) All right, keep going. We are phasing the accent out, phasing it out. So without out re-testing the results in the laboratory (pronounced the British way) the team would never have identified (British) the initial errors in their carbon dating analysis (British). Were there any questions at this point? (One student raises his hand.) Yes. (Points to him.)

A Student: Whatâs happening to your accent?

Ross: (British) Come again? Whatâs-whatâs this nonsense? (Giggles.) (American.) All right, Iâm-Iâm not English. Iâm from Long Island. I was really nervous and the accent just uh, just came out. Iâm sorry. So, if we could just get back to the lecture. Umm, were there any questions? (Everyone raises their hands) About paleontology. (They all put their hands down.) All right, look I was just trying to make a good first impression. Obviously, I screwed up. But what you guys think of me is really important because Iâm-Iâm hoping to get a permanent job here. So if you just give me another chance to make a good impressionâ¦

(At this moment Rachel bursts through the door. Needless to say, sheâs not in the best of moods having just found out Rossâs dirty little secret.)

Rachel: Ross!! Are you crazy?! I am still your wife!! What, were you just never gonna tell me?!! What the hell is wrong with you?!!!! Ugh, I could just kill you!!!!

Ross: (in the accent again) Well, hello Rachel!

Ending Credits

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is holding a football helmet; and apparently, in a rather disgusting scene, Joey wants Phoebe to beat him senseless. (Luckily it isnât a long trip.) Because heâs made a miraculous recovery from his hernia and wants to take advantage of all those free surgeries he can get now since heâs re-established his health insurance.]

Phoebe: Have you really done this before?

Joey: Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! You just take a big, big swing. Now, donât hold back. (He dons his protective helmet (Why, I have no clue.) and Phoebe picks up a wooden baseball bat and starts to swing as Chandler and Monica enter.)

Phoebe: Hey!

Joey: Hey-hey-hey!

Chandler: What are you doing?

Phoebe: Weâre just celebrating that Joey got his health insurance back.

Chandler: Oh, all right.

(Decided that they are less than human as well, Chandler picks up a golf club and Monica a frying pan, to join in on the fun of beating their good friend to within an inch of his life!)

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the gang is there except for Rachel and Ross, who both come storming in. Rachel is still going off about Rossâs secret marriage.]

Rachel: I cannot believe that you didnât tell me that we are still married!!

Ross: Look I was going to tell you!

Rachel: When?! After the birth of our first secret child?! (To All) Ross didnât get the annulment; we are still married.

Chandler: What?

Monica: Youâre kidding!

Phoebe: (overdoing it) Oh my God!!

Monica: Ross!

Ross: Okay, maybe it wasnât my best decision. But I just couldnât face another failed marriage.

Chandler: Okay, let me just jump in and ask, at what point did you think this was a successful marriage?

Ross: Rach, come on, if you think about it, itâs actually kinda funny. (He laughs, and he laughs alone.) Okay, maybe itâs best not to think about it.

Phoebe: Okay, this is inexcusable. I am shocked to my very core!

Ross: Phoebe, I told her you already knew.

Phoebe: Another lie. You have a sickness!

Chandler: Ross, just for my own piece of mind, youâre not married to anymore of us are ya?

Opening Credits

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Monica are at the counter getting some more coffee.]

Joey: Oh! Hey, somebody left their keys. (Looks at them) Ooohh, to a Porsche! {Transcriberâs note: Oh come on! Who would leave the keys to their Porsche behind? If I had a Porsche, Iâd have the keys surgically attached to my hand!} Hey Gunther, these yours?

Gunther: Yeah, thatâs what I drive. I make four bucks an hour, I saved up for 350 years!

Joey: Na-uh! (To everyone there) Hey did anybody lose their keys?

Monica: Joey, why donât you put them in the lost and found?

Joey: Thereâs a lost and found? (Gunther sets the box up on the table.) My shoe! (Grabs it out of the box.)

Chandler: You left a shoe here?!

Joey: Well, I didnât realize until I got home. I wasnât gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe! Yâknow what? Iâm gonna go find that guyâs car and leave a note on the windshield. (Goes to do so.)

Chandler: Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, Iâll be sure to give him your shoe.

Joey: Great! Thanks. (Exits.)

Phoebe: (coming in from the bathroom) Oh, good, good, you guys are here! Listen, how would like to spend tomorrow taking care of three incredibly cute little puppies?!

Monica: Oh my God, what a fun day! That sounds great!

Chandler: (not enthused) Yeah, all right.

Phoebe: Okay, well Iâll bring them by tomorrow morning. Okay, and uh, by the way, theyâre not actually puppies, theyâre Frank and Aliceâs triplets. Okay, see ya! (Exits.)

Chandler: Whoa-whoa-whoa! What?

Phoebe: (stops) Please! Please! Please! Please! Oh please! Please! Please! Frank and Alice asked me to baby sit the triplets and Iâm nervous âcause Iâve never done that before by myself!

Monica: Donât worry about it Phoebe, weâll absolutely do it.

Chandler: Yeah, Iâm gonna pass. âCause I was kinda iffy when it was puppies.

Monica: Come on Chandler, come on! Itâll give us great practice for whenâ(realizes what sheâs about to say and changes)âpeople with babies come to visit.

[Scene: The street down the block from Central Perk, Joey has found the Porsche and is writing the note.]

Guy #1: Nice car!

Joey: Yeah, itâs not mine.

Woman: (walking up) I love your car.

Joey: Yeah, itâs (looks up and sees the woman) mine.

Woman: I bet itâs fast.

Joey: Me too! Yeah. And comfortable. Do uh, do you like leather seats?

Woman: Yeah!

Joey: (checks in the window to make sure it has them) Itâs got âem!

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe and Rachel are having tea.]

Rachel: So, I still have boxes here. I still have boxes at Rossâs, and I have nowhere to live! Wow. I could so easily freak out right now.

Phoebe: What about me? I just found out that Denise is leaving town for a while, I donât have a roommate.

Rachel: Well, maybe-maybe I could be your roommate Pheebs.

Phoebe: Maybe you could be my roommate!

Rachel: Well thereâs an idea!!

Phoebe: Yeah!

Rachel: That would be great! Wait, how long is Denise gone for?

Phoebe: Umm, she said sheâd be back December 26th.

Rachel: December 26th, huh maybe sheâs Santa Clause.

(Phoebe laughs, then stops to think about it. Ross enters.)

Rachel: (deadpan) Oh look who it is, my husband. The apple of my eye.

Ross: Okay, I got us a court date for tomorrow at 2:00 and I picked up all the forms. Iâll take care of everything.

Rachel: Well sure, if you say youâre gonna take care of everything I have no reason to doubt you. Give me those forms! (Grabs them from him.) All right, now Iâm gonna do this my way and I donât want to hear a peep out of you!

Ross: Okay Rach, butâ¦

Rachel: Op! Youâre peeping!

(Ross grunts something and hands her the pen he was trying to hand her.)

Rachel: Ross! Yâknow what, I just gotâwhy? Why did you do this?!

Ross: Look I told youâ¦

Rachel: I donât wanna hear "Three failed marriages!"

Ross: Look, if youâd had two failed marriages, youâd understand!

Rachel: Well, yâknow what? Thanks to you Iâm half way there! Ugh! Oh! I am so mad! Ross, I donât think I have ever been this angry!

Ross: What about the time I said we were on a break?

Rachel: Ugh! (Stares at him.)

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the next day, Chandler, Monica, and Phoebe are baby-sitting the triplets. They each have one baby.]

Monica: Pheebs, howâs it going?

Phoebe: (rapidly) Iâm doing okay. I think itâs going well. Do you think theyâre having fun? Am I talking to fast?

Monica: Nope, sound like me. Pheebs, itâs going great. Look at Chandler with little baby girl Chandler.

Chandler: Little baby girl Chandler, where I have heard that before? Oh right, Coach Ruben. (Tries to get her to drink a little more from the bottle when he suddenly smells something. Itâs times like these Iâm glad Smell-O-Vision hasnât been invented.) Do you know what Pheebs? When youâre done over there, we kinda have a situation over here too. (Phoebe is changing hers.)

Phoebe: Na-uh, no, we are all responsible for our own babies.

Chandler: See thatâs where I think that youâre wrong. Weâve been playing these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.

Monica: What do you mean?

Chandler: I just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have our own zone. Phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. And yâknow Mon, you can be in charge of diapering and I can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they put their hands aroundâ¦ (He degrades into baby talk, but he means when they grab his finger.)

Phoebe: That sounds really great, but maybe you should be in charge of wiping.

Chandler: Okay, Iâm a rookie. I should not be in the end zone.

[Time lapse, they have set up a little assembly line for diaper changes. Phoebe wipes, Chandler adds the powder, begrudgingly, and Monica puts the diaper on.]

Monica: This is so great! This is exactly how we set the plates at the restaurant.

Phoebe: Yeah? (Checking the final diaper) Well this is not what I ordered.

Joey: (entering) Hey guys!

Chandler: Hey!

Phoebe: Hey!

Joey: Hey babies! Oh, Iâm having the best morning. That uh, that Porsche Iâve got the keys too, still there!

Chandler: Shocking! Since you still have the keys.

Joey: You should see the treatment I get when Iâm with that car! People are friendly; they-they wanna talk, and not just about the car! One guy gave me advice about my equity investments.

Chandler: What equity investments?

Joey: The ones that got me the Porsche! Will you keep up! (Chandler wipes his forehead with a baby wipe, that might have been used. He drops it disgustedly.) But I figured, if-if people keep seeing me just standing there, theyâre gonna start to think that I donât own it. So I figured Iâll wash it. Right? Monica, you got a bucket and some soap I can borrow?

Monica: Oh yeah, I got soap and sponges and rags and Carnuba wax and polishing compound.

Chandler: You donât even have a car!

Monica: I know. But umm, one time there was this really dirty car in front of the building, so I washed it.

Chandler: And?

Monica: And six others.

Chandler: There you are.

[Scene: The Porsche, Joey is finishing up washing the car and is talking to a guy about the car.]

Joey: Yeah, she tops out at 130.

Guy #2: Wow!

Joey: And thatâs just in the city. I get her up to 160 when I take her upstate.

Guy #2: Really! You got a place upstate?

Joey: Sure!

Guy #2: Well, Iâll see you later.

Joey: Okay, take it easy.

The Porsche Owner: Hey! Thatâs my car.

Joey: Really? Oh uh, oh just give me five more minutes with it.

The Porsche Owner: What-what are you doing?

Joey: Oh I-I uh, found the keys and now Iâm just polishing her up.

The Porsche Owner: But itâs my car!

Joey: Yeah, but itâs my wax.

The Porsche Owner: Listen, I-I-I donât come to this city much so I donât know if youâre crazy or this is some kind of street theater, but could I have my keys.

Joey: Sure. Here. (He hands them over.) Iâll uh, save your parking spot.

The Porsche Owner: Iâm not coming back.

Joey: Why not?

The Porsche Owner: I live upstate.

Joey: Yeah, so did I.

(The guy gets in and drives off.)

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the triplets are all in their crib as Monica and Phoebe watch them.]

Phoebe: I donât know why I was so nervous about this. And I donât know why Frank and Alice are always complaining. This is so easy.

Monica: Yeah, two hours, a lifetime thatâs the same.

Chandler: (entering) Check it out! Check it out! When the babies wake up, they can meet Krog! (He holds up this Xena-like warrior action figure.)

Monica: Chandler, what are you doing? That thing can put someoneâs eye out!

Chandler: He can do more than that! He can destroy the universe!

Phoebe: No Chandler, they can swallow one of those little parts! And also, look at his smooth area, thatâs just gonna mess them up.

Chandler: Theyâre not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way over protective. When I was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!

Phoebe: What?!

Chandler: Glass, sand, whatever. (Walks out as Monica and Phoebe turn to check on the babies again.)

Phoebe: Oh, look at little Leslie stretching in her sleep.

Monica: Oh itâs so cute. I wonder what age it is when you stop being able to put both legs over your head.

Phoebe: Oh, I can still do that.

Monica: How are you still single?!

Chandler: (entering) All right. (Clears throat) I thought about it and maybe youâre right. Maybe Krog is not a safe toy.

Monica: Good. What made you change your mind?

Chandler: I swallowed the sonic blaster gun.

Phoebe: How did that happen?!!

Chandler: Well, I was trying to prove that I was right. Yâknow? And it turns out I was wrong. And now itâs lodged in my throat. (Mimics a cat trying to cough up a hairball.) (He does it again.)

Monica: Damnit! Yâknow this whole time we were concentrating on watching the babies and, and no one was watching Chandler! (He does it again.)

[Scene: A judgeâs chambers, Rachel and Ross are filing their annulment papers.]

Judge: Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment?

Rachel: Yes your honor, and here are, are forms, all filled out.

Judge: So based on your petition you are seeking an annulment on the grounds that Mr. Geller is mentally unstable.

Ross: Fine, Iâm mentally unstable.

Judge: And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user.

Ross: What?!

Rachel: Uh yes, heroin and crack.

Ross: Crack isnât even an intravenous drug!

Rachel: Well, you would know.

Judge: Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage?

Ross: Oh, come on!

Rachel: (starts to cry) Ross, please, I found the magazines!

Judge: And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage. Well, that makes sense since youâre gay and addicted to heroin.

Ross: Okay, Iâm sorry, this is insane! I-I-Iâm not addicted to heroin, Iâm not gay, and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything! Look, Iâll consummate this marriage right here, right now!

Judge: That wonât be necessary.

Ross: And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies!

Rachel: Ugh!

Judge: Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship, that really creates a problem.

Rachel: Ross! Your honor, rest assured relationship ended like two years ago! (To the stenographer) And could you strike "Consummated like bunnies" from the record?

Judge: Is there, anything in this record that is actually true?

Rachel: Well, yes, we got married in Vegas and uh, and the names I think.

Judge: Well, based on what I heard, you two certainly donât qualify for an annulment. If you two donât want to be together youâll have to file for divorce.

Ross: (stands up) Thatâs great! Are you happy now? Look what you did with your funny, funny form!

Rachel: (stands up as well) What?! Me?! What about you and your consummated like bunnies nonsense!

Ross: And whatâ(notices the stenographer is still typing)âWhat are you typing that for? Did you hear what she said? We donât get the annulment. Donât type that! What?! Stop typing! (He goes over to where the stenographer is typing and in the process pushes Rachel out of his way.) Hey! Stop typing! (Heâs still typing.) Stop typing! Stop typing!!

Rachel: (to the judge) Okay, do you see, do you see what youâre keeping me married too?!

Judge: You need to get out of my chambers.

Rachel: All right look lady here is the deal, I came here for an annulment and I am not leaving here until I get one!

Ross: Yeah!

Judge: Would you like to spend the night in jail?

Rachel: And thank you for your time. (They both beat a hasty retreat.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is still doing the hairball thing as Monica and Phoebe are watching the babies. I canât describe it, youâll have to see it when it comes on in your area.]

Joey: (entering wearing nothing but Porsche clothes) So the Porsche guy took his car back.

Chandler: But you found the keys to his clothes?

Joey: No. No, I just uh, I just loved the way it feels when everybody thinks I own a Porsche.

Monica: And people will think you own a Porsche because youâre wearing the clothes?

Joey: Of course! Only an idiot would wear this stuff if you didnât have the car! Right?

Chandler: That is true.

Phoebe: Yeah, but only a genius would swallow a sonic blaster gun.

Joey: Oh, Iâve been there. Yeah, I am gonna go drive my Porsche. (Starts to leave.)

Monica: Joey, you know you donât actually have one.

Joey: Come on! What are you doing?! Iâm in character! Would you talk to her! (Storms out.)

Chandler: Ahh, I think it just moved. Itâs really poking me.

Monica: All right, thatâs it, weâre going to the emergency room.

Phoebe: What?! No, you canât, you canât leave me here with them! Weâre baby-sitting!

Monica: The babies are asleep, Iâm sure youâll be okay on your own for a while!

Phoebe: But you-you canât leave me with them! We-weâre a team! Weâre playing a zone! Theyâre gonna triple team me!

Monica: Heâs got something plastic lodged in his throat, weâve got to go to the hospital.

Phoebe: But no, because a doctor wonât be able to help him, itâs just gonna yâknow naturally pass through his system in like seven years.

Chandler: I think thatâs gum.

Phoebe: Iâm pretty sure itâs gun.

Chandler: Okay, listen this really hurts. Letâs go.

Phoebe: A real man wouldnât just run to the hospital! (They donât stop.) No! What would, what would Krog do? (They ignore her and Phoebe is left alone.)

[Scene: The street, Joey is hanging out wearing his Porsche grab.]

Joey: Why isnât that valet back with my Porsche?

Passerby: Maybe because youâve got the keys?

Joey: (to women passing him) Porsche.

(Ross and Rachel approach, theyâre still yelling at each other.)

Rachel: This is totally your fault!

Ross: My fault?! You threatened the judge!

Rachel: Well, you ripped the paper out of the court reporterâs machine!!

Ross: That was the only way I could get him to stop typing!

Joey: Hi! How are the Gellers?

Rachel: Donât call us that! (Storms away)

Ross: The judge wouldnât let us get an annulment! Now we gotta get a divorce!! Did a Porsch throw up on you? (Walks on.)

Joey: Hey! Itâs Porsche!! (Heâs right yâknow.)

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Phoebe is being triple teamed.]

Phoebe: Me taking care of you is no problem, huh? You guys feel safe. Right? Okay, Iâm gonna take that spit bubble as, "Yeah, I do!" Okay, after I get rid of this dirty diaper Leslie, Iâll set you up with a clean one. (She throws it at the garbage without looking, misses, and knocks over a vase and flowers, which fall to the floor and break.) Okay, Iâm sorry. I didnât mean to scare you. I just have to clean that up. Okay? âCause letâs face it, weâre at Monicaâs. (She crawls over, disposes of the diaper, picks up the flowers, and the vase.) I broke it. All right. Well, thatâs just the way that goes. (She throws out both the flowers and the vase.) Okay, good. (She turns around and only counts two babies.) Why are there only two of you? Where is Leslie? Well, you canât answer. (She starts looking for her) Leslie? Where are you Leslie? Leslie, now would be a good time for your first words! (She turns around and finds that Leslie has managed to crawl into the bottom drawer of the TV cabinet.) Well, look at you! Hey! You are a little bit mischievous! My gosh! (She picks her up and notices a surprise is waiting in the drawer.) Oh, youâre a lot mischievous! Well, itâll dry. (Closes the drawer with her foot.) (To Leslie) Okay, you sit with your brother and sister nowâwho arenât there! (They both have disappeared as well.)

[Time Lapse, the babies are finally asleep. Good for Phoebe! The only problem is, Monicaâs apartment looks like a tornado, a hurricane, a swarm of locusts, fire, brimstone, hail, and giant man-eating, radioactive ants have torn the place apart. Needless to say, itâs messy enough to cause Monica to die of shock right away. Parents with small children know what Iâm talking about.]

Chandler: (entering) Hey!

Phoebe: (exhausted) How do you feel?

Chandler: Well, letâs just say that Krog will be fully equipped to destroy the universe again in twelve to fourteen hours.

Phoebe: Okay, so I totally took care of the babies all by myself! I fed âem, bathed âem, and put âem to bed.

Chandler: And protected them from a tornado?

(Monica enters and her jaw drops in horror.)

Monica: Oh my God.

Phoebe: I know, the babies are asleep.

Monica: Phoebe, what, what happened here?!

Phoebe: I did it! I took care of the babies all by myself!

Monica: But my apartment!

Chandler: Was the setting of Phoebeâs triumph.

Monica: But the mess!

Chandler: Is not as important as the fact that Phoebe took care of the babies all by herself.

Monica: Youâre right, youâre right I shouldnât freak out. âCause this is what will happen when you and I have babies! When will that be?!

Chandler: (pause) Phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!

[Scene: Rossâs apartment, Rachel is packing what she still has over there as Ross enters.]

Rachel: (deadpan) Oh honey thank God youâre home, I was getting worried.

Ross: I picked up the divorce papers. Uh, Iâve already signed everything and I put little âXâs where you need to sign.

Rachel: Oh, little âXâs! Great! That makes up for everything!

Ross: Yâknow, I-Iâyouâve done a lot of stupid stuff too! Okay?

Rachel: Oh, name one stupid thing that is as stupid as this one!

Ross: Okay, how about you flew to London to stop my wedding! Ah, how about you told me you loved me after I was already married!

Rachel: Hey! Wait a minute! That was different! I did those things because I was in love with you!

Ross: Yeah! Right!

(Pause.)

Ross: Youâre right. Thatâs very different. So letâs, letâs just sign the papers. All right? (Sits down and Rachel keeps standing there.) What?

Rachel: Nothing. (Sits down.)

Ross: Okay, can we just sign please?

Rachel: Uh-hmm. (Just as Rachel finishes signing her name, Ross yanks each page out of the way.)

Ross: Congratulations. (Gets up to leave.)

Rachel: Okay Ross, weâreâwait a minute. Umm, I uh, I kinda have a little confession.

Ross: What?

Rachel: Well, yâknow this whole marriage thing, kinda my idea.

Ross: Excuse me?

Rachel: Well, remember how we were too drunk to remember anything the night we were married?

Ross: Yeah?

Rachel: And uh, yeah, I didnât really, I didnât want to say anything, but it kinda it just, it kinda kept coming back to me, and umm, remember we were in the casino and for some reason thought it would be funny to eat a lot of grapes. And uh, and I thought it would be funnier if we got married. So as a, as a compromise we decided first to get married, and then (Ross joins in) to eat a lot of grapes. So umm, sorry I got us into this mess.

Ross: So then if-ifâI mean if you think about it, this is all (Pause.) your fault.

Rachel: Yeah, donât push it though.

Ross: Iâve got to say; I know I divorce a lot of women, never thought I would be divorcing you.

Rachel: I know. I always thought if you and I got married, it would be the one that stuck. And it wouldnât be a secret, and we wouldnât have our wedding dinner at Pizza Hut. (They both laugh.)

Ross: Did I, did I even treat?

Rachel: No, it was on the house, it was, it was a newlywed special.

Ross: That may be the most depressing thing Iâve heard in my life. I should probably get these to my lawyerâs office.

Rachel: Hey, thanks Ross, for taking care of all of this.

Ross: Eh, no problem.

(They hug.)

Rachel: Iâm gonna need a copy of those.

Ross: Totally. (Exits.)

Ending Credits

[Scene: The street, Joey is messing with a car cover and still wearing the Porsche stuff. This guy playing street football catches a pass next to the car cover Joey is fooling around with.]

Joey: Hey! Hey! Be careful around my Porsche!

Woman: (the same one from before approaches) Hi Joey.

Joey: Hey! How you doinâ?

Woman: (to her friend) He has the most amazing Porsche under there!

Joey: Iâd love to show ya, but I just tucked her in. Sheâs sleeping. (The women both laugh) Hey uh, would you two girls like to go for a drink? (Just then the same guy with the football dives to make a catch, lands on the car cover, and collapses it. It turns out that Joey set up a bunch of boxes to make it look like a Porsche.)


[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is balancing a mini hockey stick on his hand as Chandler enters from his room carrying a bunch of bills.]

Chandler: (watches Joey for a moment) Okay! (Joey quickly moves the hockey stick so that heâs scratching his back with it.) Listen, Iâm gonna be moving out so you will be in charge of paying the rent.

Joey: Right! And when is that due?

Chandler: First of the month.

Joey: And thatâs every month?

Chandler: No, just the months you actually want to live here.

Joey: Ahhh.

Chandler: Okay, here is the phone bill. (Hands it to Joey.)

Joey: (looking at it) Oh my God!!

Chandler: Thatâs our phone number. Now look, I know I kinda sprung this whole me moving out on thing, so why donât I justâwhy donât I just cover you for a while?

Joey: No-no! No way! Joey Tribbiani does not take charityâ¦anymore.

Chandler: Itâs not charity, Joeâ¦

Joey: No! Forget it! OkayâI mean thanks, but Iâm done taking money from you. All right, I can take of myself. Now, whatâs next? Come on.

Chandler: Okay uh, hereâs the electric bill. (Hands it to him.)

Joey: This is how much we pay for electric?!!!

Chandler: Uh, yeah.

(Joey runs over and shuts off the lights.)

Chandler: So, weâll do the rest of the bills later then?

Opening Credits

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Chandler is talking to Phoebe about trying to give Joey some money.]

Phoebe: So is Joey going to have to give up the apartment?

Chandler: No, I hope not! I tried to offer him some money, but he wouldnât take it.

Phoebe: Well, how much do you think he needs?

Chandler: I figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, yâknow? But I have to trick him into taking it so I wonât hurt his pride.

Phoebe: Why donât you hire him as an actor? You could have him dress up and put on little skits. Whatever you want.

Chandler: Well that would help the pride thing.

Monica: (entering from her room) Hey!

Chandler: Hey! Wow! You look great! Wanna move in with me tomorrow?

Monica: (thinks) Okay.

Chandler: Okay! (They kiss) So, what do you girls have planned for tonight?

Monica: Well, instead of being sad that tonight is my last night together with Rachel we thought weâd go out to dinner and celebrate the fact that Rachel is moving in with Phoebe.

Phoebe: And also, my birthday.

Monica: Itâs not your birthday.

Phoebe: What a mean thing to say! I would never tell you itâs not your birthday!

(Joey and Ross enter.)

Joey: Hey!

Ross: Hey!

Chandler: Hey!

Phoebe: Hey! So you guys have anything planned for the big last night?

Chandler: Well, instead of just hanging out, we figure weâd do nothing.

Ross: Whoa-whoa-whoa, Knicks season opener tonight. I thought maybe you guys would come over and watch it.

Joey: I donât know Ross, not if youâre gonna talk about how you gave up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist.

Ross: I did give up a career in basketball to become a paleontologist!

Rachel: (entering from her room) Pheebs, I was wonderingâ¦

Monica: Youâre not dressed yet?! Weâre supposed to start having fun in 15 minutes!

Rachel: Well and clearly not a minute sooner.

Monica: Rachel, you are packed though right, I mean please tell me that youâre packed.

Rachel: Of course I packed! Monica relax! I just wanted to ask Phoebe her opinion on what I should wear tonight.

Phoebe: My God, I canât get a minute of peace around this place.

[Cut to Rachelâs bedroom, Phoebe and her are entering. And itâs obvious that sheâs not packed.]

Phoebe: Oh my God! Monicaâs just gonna kill you.

Rachel: Yeah, yeah, I know.

Phoebe: Well, what youâre wearing is fine for that.

Monica: (entering) Rachel, I need to borrowâYouâre not packed!!!! Youâre not packed even a little bit!

Rachel: Surprise!!

Monica: What?

Rachel: No, no donât get mad because lookâthis is what happened. So I-I started packing, then I realized, "What am I doing? I am lousy at packing!" Right? But you love packing! So, as a gift to you, on our last night, ta-da!
Monica: (grabs a bag of those Styrofoam peanuts) Iâll be coordinator! Oh my God! Iâm so sorry, I didnât get you anything! Okay, look everybody has to help! Okay? You can help, canât you Phoebe?

Phoebe: I have plans.

Monica: Youâre plans were with us.

Phoebe: Thatâs right.

Monica: All right, Chandler can make boxes, Ross can wrap, and Joey can lift things. Now Phoebe, go tell the guys they have to help out!

Phoebe: Okay.

Monica: Okay! (To Rachel) Oh my God, thank you!!

[Cut to living room, Phoebe enters and closes Rachelâs door behind her.]

Phoebe: Hurry! Monicaâs gonna make you pack! Sheâs got jobs for everyone! Now, itâs too late for me, but save your selves! (The guys scramble for the door.)

Monica: (entering and interrupting the guyâs escape attempt) Okay! The movers will be here in 11 hours. Rachel has not packed. Now, everybody has to help! Chandler, weâre gonna start withâ¦

Chandler: Oh nope, I-I have plans with Joey.

Monica: I thought you said you were going to do nothing.

Chandler: Yes, but for the last time.

Monica: Okay fine, now Rossâ¦

Ross: Oh, but-but I canât do it.

Monica: Why not?

Joey: (quietly) Iâve got Ben.

Ross: Because, because Iâve got Ben.

Monica: Itâs almost 8 oâclock, itâs almost past his bedtime. Where-where is he?

Chandler: Heâs at a dinner party.

Monica: Is he really coming? Because I can see right into your apartment!

Ross: Of course he is! What, do you think Iâd just use my son as-as an excuse? What kind of father do you think I am?

Monica: All right, sorry. (Goes back to Rachelâs room.)

Ross: (to the guys) I gotta go make a fake Ben.

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is entering carrying two pizzas.]

Joey: Here it is! Our last pizzas together as roommates.

Chandler: Oh, I wish Iâd know you were going to do that, I ordered Chinese.

Joey: Oh thatâs okay. Hey, actually in a way itâs kinda nice. Me, bringing the food of my ancestors, you, the food of yours!

(Chandler stares at him, dumbfounded, then finally agrees.)

Chandler: Say, Joe, I had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night. What do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?

Joey: What, are you crazy? You havenât beaten me once since my injury plagued â97 season. It would be easier if you just give me your money.

Chandler: Yes it would. What do you say to $50?

Joey: Okay, youâre on.

Chandler: Okay, letâs play! The big game, Italy vs. China, apparently.

(They start playing.)

[Scene: Rachelâs bedroom, sheâs in her closet bringing down her pair of roller blades from a top shelf.]

Rachel: Ohhhhhh, look itâs the roller blades.

Monica: (starting to cry) Oh God!

Rachel: You remember when we got these?

Monica: No.

Rachel: I guess you werenât there. (They hug.)

Phoebe: You guys, we said we were gonna have fun! Come on, hey, remember the timeâ¦ (She starts laughing hysterically.) You donât remember?

Rachel: Iâm sorry Pheebs, I guess Iâm just really said that Iâm leaving.

Monica: Iâm gonna miss you so much.

Phoebe: Well, this doesnât have to be so sad though. Yâknow? Maybe instead of just thinking about how much youâre gonna miss each other, you should like think of the things youâre not gonna miss.

Monica: I donât think thereâs anything.

Phoebe: Come on, thereâs gotta be something.

Monica: Nope, sheâs perfect.

Rachel: I have one.

Phoebe: Good! Great! You can go first.

Rachel: Uh well, I guess Iâm not gonna miss the fact that youâre never allowed to move the phone pen. (Laughs. Monica lags behind the laugh a little bit.)

Phoebe: Good thatâs a good one. Okay, Monica, anything? Yâknow? Does Rachel move the phone pen?

Monica: Aw, sometimes. Always, actually.

Phoebe: Okay, good. There you go. Doesnât anyone feel better?

Monica: Not just the phone pen. I never get my messages.

Rachel: You get your messages!

Monica: Yeah, well I donât think it really counts if you have to read them off the back of your hand after you fall asleep on the couch.

Rachel: So-so, you missed a message from who? Chandler or your mom? Or Chandler? Or your mom?

Phoebe: Great! It worked! No oneâs sad.

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, they are just finishing up another game of foosball.]

Joey: (scores) Yes! I win again! Ha-ha! Thatâs like 500 bucks you owe me! Whoo-ho-hoo! (Goes over to the fridge and starts opening and closing the door rapidly.) $500 that is a loooot of electricity! (By the way, thereâs nothing in the fridge.) Whoo-ho-ho! (Notices the sparseness of the fridge.) I gotta buy some food.

Chandler: Okay, give me a chance to win my money back. Okay? Sudden death, one goal, $1,000.

Joey: You serious?

Chandler: Oh yes!

Joey: Okay, get ready to owe me!

Chandler: Okay.

Joey: Okay, here we go. Ready?

[In slow motion, as some haunty demonic music plays in the background, Joey throws the ball in, Chandler quits playing and goes for his Chinese food. Joey smacks the ball really hard, shooting it down the table. Chandler slowly takes a bite, the ball bounces off of the wall, heads back up the table, and scores the goal for Chandler.]

Chandler: No! No! No! Noâ(Joey looks at him)âone can beat me.

(In frustration, Joey kicks the table, breaking it.)

Chandler: See? Now, thatâs why only the little fake men are supposed to do all the kicking.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, the phone rings and Monica answers it as Rachel and Phoebe move a box into the living room.]

Monica: Hello? (Listens) Oh, hi Ross! (To Rachel) See? Other people call me!

Rachel: Ooh, your brother. Score!

Monica: (on phone) Whatâs up?

Ross: Oh, Iâm just over here with Ben. I thought weâd say hi.

Monica: Oh, put him on!

Ross: Ben, say hi to Aunt Monica. (He holds the phone to the fake Ben he has created out of a pumpkin.) Oh, I guess he doesnât feel like talking right now. Heâs smiling though! Okay, talk to you later.

[Scene: Rachelâs bedroom, Rachel is entering carrying two glasses of wine. She gives one to Phoebe, keeps one, and completely ignores Monica.]

Phoebe: Yeah, I think it was better when you guys were sad. Hey, uh, remember the roller blades?

Rachel: You know what else Iâm not gonna miss? "Iâm Monica. I wash the toilet 17 times a day. Even if people are on it!"

Monica: "Hi Iâm Rachel, is my sweater too tight? No? Oh, Iâd better wash it and shrink it!"

Rachel: "Iâm Monica, I donât get phone messages from interesting people. Ever!"

Phoebe: Hey! I call her!

Monica: "Oh my God, I love Ross! I hate Ross! I love Ross! I hate Ross!"

Rachel: "Oh my God, I canât find a boyfriend! So I guess Iâll just stumble across the hall and sleep with the first guy I find in there!"

(Monica picks up one of those boxes of hair curling things, dumps it in a box, and storms out.)

Phoebe: Yeah, we should get a move on if we wanna make those dinner reservations. (Phoebe dumps a drawer full of makeup into a box.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, Joey is examining the broken foosball table as Chandler enters from his room.]

Chandler: Still broken?

Joey: This sucks man! The last night youâre here and I lose the two most important things in my life, the foosball table and $500.

Chandler: Well, there are other ways of winning back your money, how about a little uh, a little Blackjack? (Holds up a deck of cards.)

Joey: Nah, not my game.

Chandler: Okay, uh, how about, how aboutâyâknow what? We could play a new game. A new game, itâs fun.

Joey: Well, whatâs it called?

Chandler: Cups.

Joey: I donât know how to play Cups.

Chandler: Iâll teach ya! Come on, come on, itâs really easy and really, really fun.

Joey: All right.

Chandler: Okay, here you go. (He deals out two cards each.) I have two queens, what do you have?

Joey: A two and a five.

Chandler: Ho-ho, you win! 50 dollars!

Joey: Really?!

Chandler: Oh yeah! Okay, letâs play again. (He deals out two cards each again.) What do you got?

Joey: A four and a nine.

Chandler: Youâre kidding right?

Joey: No. Why?

Chandler: Well thatâs a full cup! (Pays him again.)

Joey: Damn! I am good at Cups!

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica is whining to Phoebe about Rachel.]

Monica: Iâm not talking to her!

Phoebe: Well, one of you has to take the first step! And it should be you, because sheâs the one whoâs leaving. Itâs harder for her!

Monica: Well, maybe youâre rightâShe made fun of my phone pen!

Phoebe: I know, I took it hard too.

(Monica goes into Rachelâs room.)

Monica: Listen Rachel, I feel really bad aboutâWhat are you doing? (She sees that Rachel is unpacking.)

Rachel: Iâm unpacking!

Monica: What?!

Rachel: Iâm not moving! (She re-hangs a picture, crookedly.) Is that picture straight?

Monica: It needs to go about 20 blocks to the left!

Rachel: Hey, yâknow what? Youâre the one who wants to make this big change and move in with Chandler! You should be the one to go! Why should I have to leave?!

Monica: Because itâs my apartment!

Rachel: Well itâs mine too! What else you got?!

Monica: How about, youâre moving!! (Grabs a bunch of clothes and throws them into a box. What follows is a brief sequence of Rachel unpacking and Monica packing the same stuff over and over again as Rachel chants "No." and Monica chants "Yes.")

Rachel: Look! This is ridiculous. We should be packing you!! (She knocks over Monica, grabs a box, and runs into the kitchen.)

Phoebe: Hey, how are you guys doing?

Rachel: Great! Monicaâs moving!

Monica: (entering) I am not!

Rachel: Oh really?! Then how come all your stuff is in this box?! (Monica starts chasing Rachel around the table.)

Phoebe: Okay, you guys. You guys I think I know whatâs going on here. Okay, you guysâ¦ STOP!! (They stop.) I know that, I know that youâre acting mad because you think that itâll make it easier to leave. But deep down youâre still really sad. Deep-deep down.

Monica: No Phoebe I am mad!

Phoebe: Well, deep-deep-deep down!

Rachel: Yeah, Iâm just mad!

Phoebe: Then keep running. (They resume the chase.)

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, theyâre still playing Cups.]

Chandler: You win.

Joey: Well, what did you have?

Chandler: It doesnât matter because nothing beats a three and a six. That my friend is D-Cup. Okay, now much have you won so far?

Joey: Uh, (counts the money) wow, 700.

Chandler: Not 700 exactly?

Joey: Yeah.

Chandler: Double it! (He does.)

Joey: What?

Chandler: Well you see in Cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.

Joey: Really?

Chandler: Hey, I didnât make up the rules. Now, after you receive the doubling bonus, you get uh, one card. Now that one card could be worth $100 bringing your total to 1,500. (Joey gets excited.) Donât get to excited because thatâs not gonna happen unless you getâNo way! (He takes the top card, which is the two of clubs. Of course, any card wouldâve won. Chandler pays him.)

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, Monica carries a box out of Rachelâs room.]

Monica: Well, this is the last box of your clothes. Iâm just gonna label it, "What were you thinking?"

Rachel: Funny, because I was just gonna go across the hall and write that on Chandler.

Phoebe: Hey you guys, I donât mean to make things worse, but umm, I donât want to live with Rachel anymore.

Monica and Rachel: What?!

Phoebe: Youâre just so mean to each other! And I donât want to end up like that with Rachel. I still like you!

Rachel: Well, Phoebe thatâs fine because Iâm not moving.

Monica: Whoa-whoa-whoa, Phoebe you gotta take her! Yâknow I-I-I said some really bad stuff about her, but yâknow Rachel has some good qualities that make her a good roommate.

Rachel: Oh really? Like what Monica?

Monica: Yâknow she has 147,000 pairs of bootsâ¦

Rachel: Oh yeah, good start Mon.

Monica: She lets you borrow them.

Rachel: Yeah and you stretch âem out with your big old clown feet.

Monica: Do you wanna live outside?! Because itâs gettinâ cold! (To Phoebe) She gets tons of catalogs and umm, sheâll fold down the pages of the things she thinks that Iâd like.

Phoebe: What else?

Monica: When I take a shower, she leaves me little notes on the mirror.

Rachel: Yeah, I do. I-I do, do that.

Phoebe: Thatâs nice. I like having things to read in the bathroom.

Monica: When I fall asleep on the couch after reading, she covers me over with a blanket.

Rachel: Well yâknow, I donât want you to be cold.

Monica: And when I told her that I was gonna be moving in with Chandler, she was really supportive. (To Rachel) (Starts to cry) You were so great. You made it so easy. And now you have to leave. And I have to live with a boy!! (They both break down in tears.)

Rachel: Oh, itâs gonna be fine.

Phoebe: Okay Rachel, I canât wait to live with you! And you know what we should do? Bring Monica and then we could all live there together! Weâll have so much fun!!

Rachel: But honey, I think sheâs moving in with Chandler.

Phoebe: Oh thatâs right. Youâre still set on that?

Monica: Kinda. (She hugs Phoebe and looks out the window. She moves closer to it to get a better look.) Oh my God!

[Cut to Rossâs apartment, heâs watching TV and eating some popcorn as the phone rings.]

Ross: (answering the phone) Hello? (Listens) Hey Mon, howâs the packing going? (Listens) Ben? Heâs fine. Yeah, heâs rightâOh my God! (He looks over at the fake Ben and notices that the head has fallen off.) Get your head of your shirt there son! (He tries to push the pumpkin through the neck hole.) What? (Listens) Yeah, itâs a pumpkin. Iâll come pack.

[Scene: Chandler and Joey's, (Ohh, thatâs the last time Iâm ever gonna type that line. Itâs just so sad.) Joey is entering, angrily.]

Joey: Hey!

Chandler: Whatâs wrong?

Joey: Ross and I were helping the girls pack, took a little break, I lost $1,500 to him in Cups!

Chandler: Wh-How did you lose at Cups?!

Joey: The same way you lost. I started out with a King and a Queen, bamn! Ross gets a 2 and a 3. Then I get a Jack and a King, boom! Ross gets a 4 and a 5! Ross was getting the Cup card, the D-Cup, the Sittinâ Down Bonus! Meanwhile, I didnât even get half a cup! Nothinâ!!

Chandler: Oh man!!

Joey: And he never played before either! Yâknow what I think? I think beginnerâs luck, very important in Cups.

Chandler: All right, letâs play one more hand! One more!

Joey: No, no, no more! I cannot lose another dime! Iâm serious this time! In-in fact, look, thereâs aâI wanna give you something. And let me give it too you know before I pawn it for Cups money. (He rolls the big white dog over) Now, I want you to have the big white dog as a kinda of a, yâknow, thank you for being such a great roommate.

Chandler: I canât take the big white dog! You love it!

Joey: Itâs him, not it!

Chandler: No, but waitâwhat if I bought it from you, yâknow? And your nice gesture would be giving it to me at a reasonable price, say (Gets choked up) $1,500?

Joey: Wait a second, I see what youâre trying to do here! You-youâre trying to give me money again!

Chandler: When did I try to give you money?

Joey: Over there! (Points to the couch) Before, with the bills! You tried to give some charity, I said "No," you dropped it. Okay? Then we had a nice last night together, we had some fun, we gambled, nobody tried to give anybody any money! Now out of the blue, you start with the charity thing again!

Chandler: Iâm just trying to help you out! Okay? I wanna make sure that youâre okay.

Joey: I will be okay! Look Chandler, you gotta get it out of your head that I canât take care of myself. Okay? Look, Iâm not gonna miss you helping me out with money. The only thing that Iâm gonna missâ¦is you. And now the dog.

[Scene: Monica and Rachel's, (And thatâs the last time for that line, no more Chandler and Joeyâs or Monica and Rachelâs, ever!) Joey and Ross are carrying the last table of Rachelâs. Rachel follows slowly, but is stopped by Monica.]

Monica: Hey. Call me when you get there. Okay?

Rachel: Okay.

Monica: Iâm really gonna miss you.

(They hug.)

Rachel: Oh! I have your key. Here you go. (Hands it to Monica.)

Monica: Thanks.

Rachel: Yeah.

(Silence ensues.)

Rachel: Oh God! This is silly, Iâm gonna see you in a couple of hours! (They hug again.)

Monica: Yeah.

Rachel: Bye house!

(They break the embrace.)

Rachel: Bye Mon.

Monica: Bye.

(Monica closes the door and slowly walks into Rachelâs old and now empty room.)

Chandler: (entering) Hey.

Monica: She really left.

Chandler: I know. (He kisses her.)

Monica: Thank you.

Chandler: No problem roomie. (She turns around and hugs him.)

Monica: Can I ask you a question?

Chandler: Sure!

Monica: What the hell is that dog doing here?! (She notices the dog sitting in the living room.)

(And with that, an era ends as Chandler moves in with Monica as Rachel moves in with Phoebe. It âtis a sad and happy time for Friends.)

Ross: Chandler, what kind of an idiot do you take me for? (As he picks up the fake Ben.)

Chandler: Itâs not a real game! I made it up!

Ross: Iâm sorry you lost your money, but I won it fair and square.

Chandler: At a fake game!!

Ross: Now, if you wanna try to make some of it back, Iâd be glad to play you for it. But I should warn you, I am very good at Cups.

Ross: So, I just finished this fascinating book. By the year 2030, there'll be computers that can carry out the same amount of functions as an actual human brain. So theoretically you could download your thoughts and memories into this computer and-and-and live forever as a machine.

Chandler: (not amused) And I just realized I can sleep with my eyes open.

[Monica enters]

Monica: Hey!

Ross: Yeah, yeah man don't do it. I mean if you date her, then-then-then I can't date her.

Chandler: All right, think about it. Now remember when you were going out with that girl Donna and you guys broke up. Remember how horrible it was when you guys bumped into each other at the supermarket?

Joey: (raises his hand) I don't! No, I wanna live with the super-hot Australian dancer.

Chandler: Yeah, now how's that going though? Are you okay with the not-flirting thing?

(Joey laughs nervously and goes to his bedroom.)

[Scene, The Park, Rachel is running and Phoebe is hiding behind a tree.]

Phoebe: (jumps in front of Rachel) Hi! Oh yeah, uh-huh, it's me. I saw you grab your running shoes this morning and sneak out. You lied so you could run by yourself.

Rachel: No, no Phoebe no, I was...no. You know what, I was, I was actually just checking to, see, if I could run. And I can!

Chandler: What does it look like I'm doing? I am cleaning!

Ross: Did you get Monica's authorization to move all of her stuff?

Chandler: Authorization? I don't need that. I'm gonna put everything back.

Ross: Put it back exactly where you found it?

Chandler: Yes I'm gonna put it back (Mocking Ross) exactly where I found it.

Ross: âKay, first of all, this attitude is not helping.

Chandler: She's not gonna care if I put her stuff back in the same stupid place.

Ross: Whoa, hello, did you just meet Monica?

Chandler: She is gonna recognize that I did a nice thing and-and, appreciate it.

Ross: Hmm -you know, actually this'll work out well. Cause when you have to move back in with Joey, Joey's hot new roommate can come and live with me.

Chandler: I see, I see, y-y-you're trying to freak me out.

Ross: Look Chandler, Monica is really weird about this kind stuff all right. Believe me, I lived with her for 16 years. She is going to freakâ¦out. Oh my God, she's going to sit on you.

Chandler: No, she's not okay? And I'll prove it to you. I'm gonna call her right now. (Picks up the phone and wipes it off) Phone's done ehh.

Monica: (on phone) Hi!

Chandler: Hey Mon, how's it going?

Monica: Terrible. If-if I want something done right, I have to do it myself. Other people just wreck stuff. I really think I might kill someone tonight.

Chandler: Oh come on, come on, it can't be that bad.

Monica: It's worse. The only thing that's getting me through is knowing that I'm gonna be seeing you soon. I think I may even try to get out of here early.

Chandler: No! No-no-no-no-no-no. It sounds like they really need you down there.

Monica:  Well, are you just hanging out with Ross?

Chandler: It's, all good! Okay bye-bye Mon! (To Ross) She's-she's gonna kill me.

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica and Chandlerâs, continued from earlier.]

Joey: No-no-no I've seen it happen, you-you get a rapport going with a woman but somehow you manage to kill it. What's your secret?

Ross: Look, we do not repel women OK? That is completely untrue.

Chandler: Oh no, yes we do my man. Remember when we were back in college and we went to that spring dance and you walked right up to that girl you liked and you could not stop talking about the Irish potato famine?

Ross: Yeah, well what about you? You weren't you know, so hot in college either. After everything he said, he'd go "ba dum bum chessh"

Joey: This is great, this is great, what else, what else?

Ross: Uh, they don't like it when you correct their grammar.

Chandler: And they don't like it when you explain why your jokes are funny.

Rachel: Well, I-I should've told you the truth.

Rachel: Well, it's embarrassing. People were looking at us like we were crazy.

Phoebe: Why do you care?

Rachel: Because they're people.

Phoebe: But people that you don't know and will never see again.

Rachel: Yes, but still. They're peopleâ¦with eyes.

Phoebe: Well, I didn't get embarrassed running next to Miss (panting). But no, okay. No, no, I can see why running with me would be embarrassing to you. Yeah, okay. You're uptight.

Rachel: I-I am not uptightâHey-hey-hey-oh-oh! Listen, I am not uptight, man.

Phoebe: That's okay Rachel. I'm not judging you; that's just who you are. Me. I'm more free y'know? I run like I did when I was a kid, cause that's the only way it's fun. Y'know, I mean didnât you ever run so fast you thought your legs were gonna fall off? Y'know, like when you were like running towards the swings or running away from Satan? (Rachel looks confused) The neighbor's dog.

Janine: Is there something wrong?

Joey: All right, All right, let's just get this out in the open okay? You're hot. I'm lovable. Clearly there's a vibe going on between us. But, we're roommates and it's a huge mistake for us to continue down this road.

Janine: Joey...

Joey: No, no, no, I'm telling ya. Imagine yourself living in a supermarket and you will understand okay? So the question is, what do we do?

Janine: Well, I don't think there is anything to do. I mean I think you're really sweet, but I'm just not interested in you like that.

Joey: Oh!

Janine: No! I mean you're a really nice guy and I'm happy to be your roommate and your friend, I'm just y'know, I just don't feel that way about you.

Joey: Oh! I see what happened. It's because I was trying to repel you. Right? Believe me, you'd feel a lot different if I turned it on.

Janine: I don't think so.

Joey: Oh, I do. (Gives her the Joey-love look.) How you doin?

Monica: Well, the end table is wrong, The couch looks bizarre and don't even get me started on the refrigerator magnets.

Chandler: Okay look, don't...don't be mad okay? But after I unpacked the boxes I wanted to do something nice for you, so, I-I-I cleaned the apartment. So I moved everything around and then I forgot where it, where it went back and I'm sorry, I'm very sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

Monica: It's okay. Chandler, are you afraid of me or something?

Chandler: Do you want me to be afraid of you?

Monica: Of course not. I mean gosh, Chandler what you did, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it. I know I have this weird thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I'd never expect you to worry about that.

Chandler: Really?

Monica: All right, hold on okay? First thing's first. (Gets her cleaning gloves on) Okay, now did Ross sit anywhere while he was naked?

Rachel: Oh no, no, no. Oh God, you think I made out with him.

Kim: Listen to me. If you think sleeping with Ralph is going to get you my job. You are sadly mistaken.

Rachel: I-I donât want your job. I-I donât. Ohh this is such a mistake. I did not make out with him. Nobody made out with him. I did not use my keycard yesterday. I donât even know how to use my keycard. (The elevator stops. Ralph steps on.)

Chandler: Youâre turning into a women.

Joey: No Iâm not. Why would you say that? Thatâs just mean.

Chandler: Now Iâve upset you? What did I say?

Joey: Itâs not what you said. Itâs the way you said itâ¦.Oh My God, Iâm a women!!!

[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are there.]

Rachel: Now, she thinks that I made out with him and I did it to get her job.

Phoebe: But why didnât you just tell her the truth.

Rachel: I did but she doesnât think anyone would be stupid enough to confuse Kenny the copy guy with Ralph Lauren.

Phoebe: Well, hey, what if Kenny were the real brains behind the whole company? You know. What if Kenny hired that Ralph Lauren guy to be the pretty front man? Huh, did she ever think of that?

Rachel: You were with Kenny today, werenât you?

Phoebe: Just for a second.

Rachel: Ohh, Phoebe, what am I going to do?

Phoebe: Well, the only thing you can do. Sleep with Ralph Lauren.

Rachel: Iâm not going to sleep with Ralph Lauren. I mean, I could, but I wouldnât.

Phoebe: Ohh, sleep with Kenny.

Rachel: That wouldnât help me.

Phoebe: Ohh, yes it would.

Hillary: Iâve had a really good time tonight.

Ross: Mmm.

Hillary: You know, I rarely connect with someone this much on the first date.

Ross: (Giggling) Hmm-Hmm-Hmm. (Picking up a piece of bread and covering his mouth.) Me, neither. Iâve had a really good time too, you know. (Putting the bread down.)

Hillary: Are you going to eat that bread?

Ross: (Putting the bread up to his nose.) Ohh, I just like the smell. (Sniffing it.) Mmmm.

Hillary: (Laughing) You make me laugh.

Ross: Hmm-Hmm.

Hillary: Would you like to move over to the couch?

Ross: Mmm-Hmm. (Picking up their wine glasses.)

Hillary: Maybe Iâll just turn the lights down a little.

Ross: (Covering his mouth with the glass.) How about all the way.

Hillary: Okay. (She goes to turn the lights off and Ross sits on the couch. She has some black light posters on the wall.)

Ross: (Looking at the posters.) Wow, cool poster. Or should I say groovy poster? (They sit down on the couch. Ross smiles and the black light fluoresces his teeth.) So, ahh, where were we?

Hillary: Are those your teeth??

Ross: Ohh, you can see them, huh?

Hillary: Yes. Theyâre insanely white.

Ross: I-I, did that for you.

Hillary: Whatâs a matter with you?

Ross: Whatâs a matter with me? Youâve got a black light. Itâs 1999!

[Scene: Elevator at the Ralph Lauren Offices, Rachel gets in . Kim is there.]

Rachel: Kim, hi.

Kim: Hi Rachel. Ohh, Iâve been meaning to ask you. Have you seen the new Ralph Lauren sheets? Ohh, what am I thinking. Of course you have.

Rachel: Okay..Okay.. Look. Iâm sorry that I lied to you before. You were right. Ralph and I were an item but were not anymore.

Kim: Oh, really?

Rachel: (Faking crying.) Yeah, he dumped me. He said, "Rachel, I canât do this. Even though you are a very, very, very beautiful women. I canât do this. Iâm married and Iâm sorry." And then I donât know why but he said, "and you will never get promoted. Especially not above Kim, who is an integral cog in the Ralph Lauren machine."

Kim: You expect me to believe..(Doors open, Ralph steps in.) Hi Ralph.

Ralph Lauren:: Hi Kim. (Dead silence again until he gets off.)

Kim: Oh my God. He just gave you the coldest look I have ever seen. Itâs like he hates you. Then it is true.

Rachel: Of course itâs true and it hurts so bad.

Kim: Ohh honey come here. (Hugging Rachel.) Ohh it will be ok. Weâve all been there.

Rachel: You and Ralph?

Kim: Kenny the copyboy.

[Scene: Joey and Janineâs apartment, Joey paces the floor waiting for Janine. She walks in.]

Janine: Hey.

Joey: Hey, uhh, I need to talk to you.

Janine: Whatâs the matter? Are you upset?

Joey: Iâm sorry but weâve got to get rid of all this girlie stuff in here. I, uh, I got to be a man! Okay. The living room has to remain a guy place, okay? Thatâs just the way it has to be.

Janine: Well, if thatâs what you want. Iâll just put it all in my room.

Joey: Greatâ¦Greatâ¦and thanks for being so understanding. I mean, I didnât want to make a big deal out of this, you know. (She starts to collect all the girlie stuff up.) You could, uh, put the picture of the famous baby in my room. I mean, if you want to.

Janine: Okay.

Joey: And, uhh, maybe the watering can there.

Janine: Sure.

Joey: And a couple of these little tiny boxes.

Janine: Joey? Do you want me to put it all in your room?

Joey: (Smiling) Okay.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is mixing some Thanksgiving treat (Iâm assuming mashed potatoes) in a bowl.]

Monica: (on phone) Okay, great!  Bye. (Hangs up as Chandler enters.) So guess whoâs coming to Thanksgiving dinner?

Chandler: Sydney Portier? Hehheh.

[Chandler throws his coat on the couch]

Monica: (not amused by Chandlerâs joke) I miss Rachel. (To Chandler) No, my parents.

Chandler: Oh! Thatâs great, they havenât seen the place since I moved in!

[Monica goes to fiddle with something on the table.]

Monica: Yeah, and yâknow, if you could not mention to them that we live together, that would be great! (Quickly trying to change subjects), I was thinking we would eat around four.

[Monica goes to the stove.]

Chandler: (shocked at the news) Why canât I tell them that we live together?

Monica: Because they donât know weâre dating. (Again, trying to quickly change subjects.) Do you think we should eat in the kitchen? (Goes to the sink and the stove to cook.)

Chandler: Why havenât you told them?!

Monica: Um, well, I was going to, I-I-I really was. But um, then somewhere, just out of nowhere, I didnât.

Chandler: Why havenât you told them?! Wouldnât they be happy?!

Monica: (trying to change subjects, excitedly) So! Dinner in the kitchen around four! Iâll see you then. (Pats Chandler on the shoulder and goes into the living room.)

Chandler: Why wouldnât they be happy?

Monica: Well, um, because mainly, um, they donât like you. Iâm sorry.

Chandler: What? What? Why?!

Monica: Maybe because you used to be aloof, or that youâre really sarcastic, or that, yâknow, you joke around all the time. Or that you take off your clothes and throw them on the couch.

Chandler: Is this why they donât like me or why you donât like me?

Monica: Look, I know that I shouldâve told them. I know I shouldnât care what they think. Iâm sorry.

Chandler: Yâknow, itâll be okay. Itâll be okay. Because when they come over, I will be all charming, I will make them fall in love with me, and then weâll tell âem.

Monica: You really think thatâll work?

Chandler: Hey, I can be pretty charming, babe, I won YOU over, didnât I?

Monica: (hugging Chandler) I donât think youâll ever get my parents that drunk!

Chandler: Well Monica just told me that they donât.

Ross: (not paying attention) Yeah, they donât like you.

Chandler: (annoyed) Do you know why?

Ross: I dunno, maybe itâs because youâre really sarcastic. Or maybe itâs cause you uh-

Chandler: (angry) Well if people donât know they shouldnât just guess!

[Joey and Ross get annoyed with Chandler's outburst.]

Chandler: This is great, another Thanksgiving with nothing to give thanks for.

Joey: Maybe I could give thanks for you shuttinâ up, eh?

Joey: Yeah! Yeah, why? Whatâs up?

Janine: Well, me and my dancer friends are thinking of doing Thanksgiving uptown. I thought you guys might like to come.

Ross: For real?

Janine: No, but you should go to Chandlerâs. Because none of us knows how to cook, weâll probably just end up drinking all day.

Joey: Ye-ye, we go to yours!

Ross: Yeah, see, we-we-we have to stop across the hall, because itâs my sister. But, uh, uh yâknow actually, growing up with a sister was nice because it really helped me understand women. Yeah, you-you should tell your friends that.

Janine: (not sure of what to make of that) Okay.

[Janine leaves]

[Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel laugh]

Monica: Nothing.

Rachel: (worried) Nothing?

Monica: No, sweetie, I-I trust you.

Rachel: So, if-if I mess this up, thereâs nothing else for dessert?

Monica: Youâre not gonna mess it up.

Ross: (to Joey) Dude, we were good!

Monica: Youâre not gonna go anywhere, you said you were gonna eat here, and youâre gonna eat here!

Phoebe: Yeah, and-and leaving us to go see hot dancer girls is not very Thanksgivingy.

Ross: Oh, but-but it is, uh, itâs just like the first Thanksgiving, when the Indians and the Pilgrims uh, sat down to dinner.

Joey: Yeah, yeah, and the Indians taught the Pilgrims what it meant to be hot in the new world!

[Enter Jack and Judy Geller]

Mrs. Geller: Hello everybody!

Mr. Geller: Hi!

All: Hi!

Monica: Dad [kisses Jack], Mom [kisses Judy]. Look! Look who it is itâs Chandler!

Mrs. Geller: (less than pleased) Oh yes of course, hello Chandler.

Chandler: Mr. and Mrs. Geller, you look wonderful, it is great to have you hear, let us take off your coats!

[Chandler goes to take off Jackâs coat. He then notices little white flakes on Jackâs shoulders. He begins to wipe them off.]

Chandler: Whoa, snowing out there?

Mr. Geller: (angry) No.

[Time lapse. The gang is sitting down for Thanksgiving dinner. Chandler is at the head of the table, Mr and Mrs Geller are to his right. Joey and Ross are to his left. Monica is serving things. Phoebe is in the living room and Rachel is at the sink.]

Mr. Geller: Monica, all this food looks wonderful, you should think about doing this for a living.

[Chandler, trying to make nice with Jack, laughs at his joke and points at Jack.]

Mr. Geller: Ok, I have dandruff. Thereâs no need to laugh and point.

[Monica rushes over to Chandlerâs side.]

Monica: Dad, Chandler was just laughing at your joke.

Mr. Geller: My joke wasnât funny.

[Phoebe walks from the living room to the kitchen and talks quietly to Rachel.]

Phoebe: Rach, Rach, I just remembered. I had a dream about Mr. Geller last night.

Rachel: Really?!

Phoebe: Yeah, I dreamt that he saved me from a burning building and he was so brave and so strong! And itâs making me look at him totally differently. Yâknow, I mean he used to be just, yâknow âJack Geller Monica and Rossâs dadâ and now heâs heâs âJack Geller, dream hunk."

[We see a shot of Jack stuffing his face with food. Some dream hunk!]

Rachel: I dunno. Yâknow to me heâll always be âJack Geller, walks in while youâre changing.â

[Time lapse. Ross and Joey are cleaning the table while Judy and Phoebe talk by the window. Jack and Chandler are sitting on the couch while Monica sits on the coffee table.]

Monica: Yâknow dad, Chandler is one of Rossâs very best friends!

Chandler: Yeah, Ross sure is a great guy, yâknow Iâve always felt that how a young man turns out is a reflection on his father.

Mr. Geller: I always thought that too. Tell me, what does your father do?

[Chandler and Monica exchange worried looks.]

Chandler: (worried) Heâs the headliner of a gay burlesque show.

[Rachel is in the kitchen fiddling with her English truffle. Joey and Ross, anxious to leave and go to Janineâs party, are egging her on to hurry up.]

Joey: Rach, youâre killinâ us here, will ya serve the dessert already? Those drunken dancers are waiting!

Rachel: (looking at her truffle) Look at it, isnât it beautiful?

Ross: Yeah, yeah, what is it?

Rachel: Itâs a truffle. Itâs got all of these layers. First thereâs a layer of ladyfingers, then a layer of jam, then custard, which I made from scratch, [Joey and Ross make impressed faces] then raspberries, more ladyfingers, then beef sauteed with peas and onions, [Joey and Ross look like somethingâs wrong.] then a little more custard, and then bananas, and then I just put some whipped cream on top!

[Joey and Ross make confused faces.]

Ross: W-What was the one right before bananas?

Rachel: The beef? Yeah, that was weird to me, too. But then, yâknow, I thought âwell, thereâs mincemeat pie,â I mean thatâs an English dessert, these people just put very strange things in their food, yâknow. [To Joey] Oh! by the way, can I borrow some Rum from your place?

Joey: Y-sure!

Rachel: (teasingly) And while Iâm gone donât you boys sneak a taste.

Joey and Ross: (faking dissapointment) Okay.

[Rachel leaves]

Ross: Beef in a dessert?! I- no no no, there is no way!

[Ross goes to look in the magazine Rachel got her recipe from.]

Joey: I know, and only one layer of jam?! What is up with that?

[Ross looks up as if saying that Joey was weird. He begins flipping through the pages, only to find that they are sticky. So one page is overlapping another, making two recipes look like one.]

Ross: Oh my God, the pages are stuck together!

Joey: (turning to Chandler in a scolding tone) Chandler!

Ross: Oh My God, she-she made half a English Trifle, and half a...Sheperdâs Pie!

Joey: (sad) Oh man! Now sheâs gonna start all over! Weâre never gonna get to introduce the hot girls to the new world!

Ross: No, no, we will. We just wonât tell her she messed up.

Joey: Just let her serve the beef-custard thing?

Ross: Yeah, itâll be like a funny Thanksgiving story!

Joey: (shrugging his shoulders to go along with it) Vomiting stories are funny...

[Rachel enters]

Rachel: Joey, God, your apartment is like a hundred degrees!

Joey: Did-did it make you wanna walk around in your underwear?

Rachel: No!

Joey: (frustrated) Still not hot enough!

[Joey leaves]

[Phoebe walks over to talk to Rachel.]

Phoebe: Rachel?

Rachel: Yeah?

Phoebe: Okay, look at him. Look at those strong hands. Oh what I wouldnât give to be that can of (looks closer to see what Jack is drinking) condensed milk.

[We see a shot of Jack drinking condensed milk on the couch.]

[Ross and Judy enter the living room. Judy and Ross sit down on the couch beside Jack. Monica and Chandler are sitting on the coffee table.]

Monica: Mom, uh, Chandler was just saying how beautiful your sweater is.

Mrs. Geller: Oh, thank you Chandler! I just bought it.

Chandler: Oh, yes. Well itâs very beautiful. Itâs cream-colored and tight [Realizes what he just said and looks worried. Monica and Ross also looked shocked. Judy and Jack give Chandler a very dirty look.] I donât mean tight, I mean itâs not too tight, not that I was looking at-[giving up all hope, he puts his head into his hands.]

Mr. Geller: Whatâs the matter with him?

Mrs. Geller: (whispers to Jack a little loudly) I think heâs stoned again.

Chandler: (shocked) What?

Monica: (shocked) What?

Ross: (worried) Dude, I need to talk to you a sec.

[Ross and Chandler get up and go into Rachelâs old room.]

[Scene: Rachelâs old room. Itâs pretty much empty except for a few boxes against the walls. Ross and Chandler enter.]

Ross: Okay, I think I might know why my parents donât like you.

Chandler: You do? Why?

Ross: Okay, remember, we were young. Hey, Spring break, sophomore year, I got high in my bedroom and my parents walked in and smelled it and so I told them that you had gotten stoned and jumped out the window.

Chandler: What?! Why did you do that?

Ross: I donât know, aheh, yourâs was the first name that-that popped into my head, Iâm Iâm sorry. I-I didnât think it would matter.

Chandler: How could it not matter?!

Ross: How was I supposed to know weâd end up being friends after college, let alone you-you would be living with my sister?

Chandler: What about all that âfriends foreverâ stuff?

Ross: I donât know, I-I was all high.

Commercial Break

[Scene: Rachelâs Old Bedroom, Continued from earlier. Monica enters the room.]

Monica: Mom and dad just sent me in here to find out if you (points to Chandler) were trying to get Ross stoned!

Chandler: Your parents caught Ross smoking pot in college and he blamed it on me!

Monica: Ross, I canât believe youâd do that!

Chandler: The reason we havenât told them weâre together is because they hate me, okay? So will you fix this?

Ross: Okay, okay, Iâll tell âem it wasnât Chandler who got high. Now who should I say it was?

Monica: You! Itâs not like itâs a big deal! You-you donât still do it or anything!

Joey: (to Rachel) Will you hurry up? Did you not hear me before when I told you that all of Janineâs friends are dancers?! And that theyâre going to be drinking alot!?

Rachel: (sarcastically) No, I did, but tell me again, because itâs so romantic.

Joey: Well youâre whippinâ so slow! Canât you do it any faster?

Rachel: Joey! Come on! I donât wanna make any mistakes, alright? This is the only dessert and if I screw it up everybody's gonna be like âOh, remember that Thanksgiving when Rachel screwed up the trifle?â

[Joey gives her an understanding look.]

Rachel: So why donât you just let me worry about making the trifle and you just worry about eating it, alright?

Joey: Oh I am!

[Chandler and Monica are by the window pressuring Ross to tell his parents the truth.]

Monica: Ross, if you donât tell them, then I will!

Joey: Look, when everyone eats that...that...Banana-Meat thing, theyâre all gonnaâ make fun of her, do you want that?

Ross: Okay, okay, weâll just get everyone to act like they like it. That-that way noone makes fun of her and we still get to go to Sweet Potatoe Pie! (Referring to the dancers.)

Joey: (scolding) Dude, theyâre not objects.

[Ross makes a sorry face.]

Joey: Just kiddin,â Iâll talk to them, you distract Rach.

Ross: And um...You look nice today.

Rachel: Oh no. No Ross, donât do this.

Ross: What?

Rachel: I just- I donât think us getting back together is a good idea.

Ross: (shocked) Eh?

Rachel: I thought this might happen today. Ross, I know the holidays can be rough. Yâknow? And itâs probably really hard for you to be alone right now.

Ross: (cutting her off) Youâre alone.

Rachel: No, I-I live with Phoebe. I mean youâre [pity-tone] alone, alone. And I just-itâs just not the time for us. Iâm sorry.

[Inside Monica and Chandlerâs. Joey is almost done explaining the situation to everyone.]

Joey: Oh and (Ross begins to open the door and Joey says some gibberish word to indicate to Ross that heâs not done yet. Ross closes the door again.) Okay, and uh if anyone needs help pretending to like it, I learned something in acting class, try uh, rubbing your stomach (Rubs his stomach) or uh, or saying âmmmâ and uh, oh oh! And smiling (Smiles while pretending to stir a bowl), okay?

Chandler: Yeah, Iâm not gonna pay for those acting classes anymore.

[Ross and Rachel re-enter.]

Joey: Rachel, there you are! Come on, letâs serve that dessert already!

Rachel: Joey, youâre gonna have to stop rushing me, you know what? You donât get any dessert.

Joey: (happily) Really?

[Monica takes a bigger spoonful and a pea falls off]

Rachel: Op! Wait, you dropped a pea.

[Monica puts the pea on top of the spoonful and takes a bite.]

Rachel: Well?

Monica: (faking joy. Rubbing her stomach and smiling at the same time, like Joey said) Mmmm! Itâs good!

Rachel: Really? How good?

Monica: Itâs so good, that I feel really selfish about being the only one whoâs eating it, that I think we should have everyone taste how good it is. Especially Ross.

[Ross glares at Monica.]

[Everyone takes a bite of their trifle.]

All: (faking enjoyment) Mmm.

Chandler: (clearly lying and hating the dessert) Yeah, this is so good, that Iâm gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.

[Chandler exits to the balcony.]

Mrs. Geller: (lying) Iâve gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monicaâs room.

Mr. Geller: (also lying) Iâll help you dial.

[Jack and Judy exit to Monicaâs room.]

Monica: (again, lying) Iâm gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.

[Monica exits to the bathroom.]

Rachel: Okay, now what was that all about? Is it-does it not taste good? Let me try it.

[Rachel reaches for Rossâs plate]

Ross: Wha? No no! Ah! (Ross scarfs all of his trifle down in about a second. He looks like heâs going to throw up.) (Lying) All gone! So good! Maybe Chandler has some left.

[Rachel leaves to the balcony.]

Ross: It tastes like feet!

Joey: I like it.

Ross: Are you kidding?

Joey: Whatâs not to like? Custard? Good. Jam? Good. Meat? Gooooood.

[Rachel and Chandler re-emerge from the balcony.]

Rachel: ...So a bird just grabbed it, and then tried to fly away with it and, and then just dropped it on the street?

[Chandler makes a fake "I know I couldnât believe it either" gesture.]

Chandler: (lying) Yes, but if itâs any consolation, before the bird dropped it, he seemed to enjoy it.

[Phoebe comes back from Rachelâs old room.]

Phoebe: Rachel, come here. (Rachel walks over to Phoebe. Chandler sits down on the lounge-chair.) Okay, I was just starting to take my Thanksgiving nap, and I had another dream about Jack.

Rachel: Oh, Phoebe, do I wanna hear this?

Phoebe: I dunno, letâs see! So, okay, I dreamt that we were gonna get married, and he left, becuz he had to go fight a fire. And, um, so okay, I went to a night club, and I saw him making out with a girl.

Rachel: (humoring Phoebe) Oh my God, he dream-cheated on you!

Phoebe: Yeah, but then Jacques Cousteau came and he kicked his ass for betraying me! It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.

[Jack and Judy come out of Monicaâs room and sit down on the couch.]

Mr. Geller: Boy, Iâm glad I wore the big belt today.

Phoebe: Five minutes ago, a line like that wouldâve floored me. Now nothing. Well, not nothing, I am still a woman.

[Rachel and Phoebe walk into the kitchen. Monica comes out of the bathroom and goes over to Ross.]

Monica: Ross? Letâs go.

Ross: Oh yeah, about telling Mom and Dad, I was thinking about maybe writing a letter.

Monica: Alright, you know what? Thatâs it. Youâve had your chance.

Ross: Wha-what?

Monica: (out loud, to her parents) Mom! Dad! Ross smoked pot in college!

Mr. and Mrs. Geller: What?!

Ross: (in a 5 year oldâs tone) (To Monica) You are such a tattletale! Mom, Dad, you remember that-that time you walked in my room and smelled marijuana?

Mr. and Mrs. Geller: Yes. (They look at Chandler angrily.)

Ross: Well I told you it was Chandler who was smoking the pot but it was me. Iâm sorry.

Mrs. Geller: It was you?

Monica: And Dad, yâknow that mailman that you got fired? He didnât steal your Playboys! Ross did!

[The Gellers stare at Ross. Ross looks at his parents with an afraid, shocked look.]

Ross: Yeah, well, Hurricane Gloria didnât break the porch swing, Monica did!

[The Gellers glare at Monica.]

[Joey, Phoebe, and Rachel are sitting at the table, looking at the Geller siblings like theyâre weirdos.]

Monica: Ross hasnât worked at the museum for a year!

[The Gellers glare at Ross.]

Ross: Monica and Chandler are living together!

[The Gellers glare at Monica, shocked]

[Monica and Chandler both are shocked. Ross gives Monica a âtake that!â look.]

Monica: Ross married Rachel in Vegas! And got divorced! Again!!!!

[The Gellers glare at Ross.]

Phoebe: (joining in) I love Jacques Cousteau!

Rachel: (reading the recipe magazine, finally figuring out that...) I wasnât supposed to put beef in the trifle!

Joey: (pounding the table) I wanna gooooooo!

Mrs. Geller: (rubbing her temples) Thatâs alot of information to get in in thirty seconds! Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you werenât supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, Iâm sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead. (Phoebe makes a sad face.) Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.

Mr. Geller: And we kinda figured about the porch swing.

Mrs. Geller: Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?

Mr. Geller: What happened son?

Ross: I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!

Mrs. Geller: Chandler! Youâve been Rossâs best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. (Ross gets disgusted.) And now youâve taken on Monica as well. Well, I donât know what to say. Youâre a wonderful human being.

[Chandler is mega shocked!]

Chandler: Thank you!

Mr. Geller: No! Thank you! (Hugs Chandler) Monica, and Ross! I donât know what Iâm gonna do about the two of you!

Chandler: (In a parent-like tone) Iâll talk to them!

Closing Credits

[Scene: Monica and Chandlerâs, Everyone is helping clean the table.]

Rachel: You guys! It was bananas, cream, and beef! I-I just cannot believe that you ate that so that I wouldnât feel bad!

Monica: Well actually, I-I didnât eat mine. Itâs still in the bathroom.

Joey: No it isnât, I ate that.

Mrs. Geller: (pointing to herself and Jack) Well we left ours in Monicaâs bedroom.

Joey: Nope, got it and I got yours (Pointing to Jack) too.

End[Scene: Monica and Chandlerâs apartment, everyone except Ross is decorating the tree.]

Chandler: Let me ask you, why is everybody using these tiny lights nowadays? I remember when people used to use big lights.

Rachel: Thatâs a good story, Grandpa.

(Ross enters)

Ross: Hey

All: Hey

Ross: Wow, Monicaâs letting other people help decorate her tree! Did someone get her drunk again or?

Monica: Having a perfectly decorated tree is not what Christmas is about. Itâs about being with the people that you love.

Phoebe: That is nice and weâre done. TADA!

(Her side of the tree looks a complete mess)

Chandler: I dunno what it is, it just doesnât quite feel like Christmas to me.

Monica: Oh, here.

(She turns the tree around so that her side, which is perfectly decorated, is showing)

Chandler: See now it feels like Christmas!

Opening Credits

[Scene: Central Perk, everyone except Phoebe and Joey are there.]

Ross: â¦ and thatâs the story of the dreidle. Now, some people trace the Christmas tree back to the Egyptians, who used to bring green palm branches into their huts on the shortest day of the year, symbolising lifeâs triumph over death. And that was like 4000 years ago.

Rachel: So, pretty much around the same time that you started telling this story.

(Joey enters)

Joey: Hey you guys.

Chandler: Hey Joe whatâs up?

Joey: I had to get out of the apartment. Janine is like stretching all over the place. Yâknow, everywhere I look sheâs likeâ¦ (He imitates her stretching)

Chandler: I can see why thatâs hard to resist.

Joey: I like her so much!

Monica: Aw, Iâm sorry sweetie that she doesnât feel the same way.

Joey: I know. And sheâs so sweet. I just wanna feed her grapes and brush her hair.

Chandler: You are aware that sheâs not a monkey, right?

Ross: I am so over Janine. I mean, yeah, at first I thought she was hot, but now sheâs like OLD NEWS!

(Janine enters)

Janine: Hey guys!

Ross: Hi Janine!

Janine: I just got a call to be a dancer on a television special for New Yearâs Eve. Itâs called some sort of Dickân Rockân Dickie Eve.

Monica: Hold it! Are you talking about Dick Clarkâs New Yearâs Rocking Eve?

Janine: Yeah, thatâs what I said.

Monica: Oh my God! We love that show! I mean Ross and I have been watching it since I can remember!

Chandler: Ah, youâre still just a little fat girl inside arenât you? (He kisses her on the cheek)

Janine: Well Iâm gonna be on it this year. Iâm gonna be one of the party people.

Ross: Youâre gonna be a party person! Those guys rock the most!

Janine: Well they said I should bring someone. (To Joey) Do you wanna be my dance partner?

Joey: Totally! I would love to spend New Yearâs with you.

Janine: Well actually theyâre taping tomorrow. I donât really understand why.

Ross: Oh, well you see how it works is, the part with Dick Clark in Times Square is actually live, but they tape some of the party stuff ahead of time. Yeah, not a lot of people know that.

Janine: Yeah well, do you guys wanna come too?

Ross: Are you serious?

Monica: We are there!

(Rachel laughs)

Chandler: What, what are you laughing at?

Rachel: Well, I used to date him, but youâre still going out with her!

(Gunther brings Janine a coffee)

Janine: Thanks. (To Monica and Ross) Great so we can all go together! I gotta run. Catch you later!

(Janine leaves)

All: Bye!

Ross: Bye Janine!

Joey: Did she just ask me out on a date?

Chandler: I donât think so.

Monica: What are you talking about? She just invited him to the biggest party of the millennium!

Rachel: Yeah, but she also invited you and Ross. Yeah, honey, Iâm sorry, but I donât think that was a romantic thing.

Joey: Oh. Maybe. But hey I know how I can find out. Weâre going to a New Yearâs Eve party, right? So at midnight, I can kiss her. And if she kisses me back, great! Yâknow? But if she says âDude, what the hell are you doing?â I can say âIt wasnât me, it was New Years!â

Rachel: Well, thatâs a lot better than Ross trying to kiss me in High School, and saying that he did it because he needed chapstick.

Ross: It was a dry day.

Monica: We are going to Dick Clarkâs New Yearâs Rocking Eve!

Ross: Oh my God!

Monica: Oh my God!

Chandler: (To Rachel) Oh my God!

[Scene: The Set, Joey, Janine, Ross and Monica are walking in.]

Joey: OK, listen Iâve been on sets before, so let me give you a little advice, alright? Itâs a show, but weâre just dancing, OK? Itâs no big deal. The important thing to remember â stay cool.

Ross: Got it!

(They get to the main stage)

Ross: Oh my God itâs just like I dreamed it!

Director: OK, everyone gather up.

(Monica and Ross push to the front)

Monica and Ross: âScuse us

Director: Hereâs whatâs gonna happen. The musicâs gonna start, youâre gonna dance, weâre gonna tape, you donât look at the camera. Any questions?

Ross: Yeah, I have a question. When is this gonna air?

(He and Monica laugh)

Director: Uh, yeah. Now you guys dance over there, you guys over there, and I want you two right around here, and everyone else spread out.

Joey: Ross! So when is it gonna air?

[Scene: Monica and Chandlerâs apartment, Chandler is there. Phoebe and Rachel enter.]

Rachel: Okay, you look in the kitchen, I will look in the back closet.

Chandler: I can save you time ladies, Iâm right here.

Phoebe: Yeah, Chandler why donât you take a walk? This doesnât concern you.

Rachel: We are looking for our Christmas presents from Monica.

Chandler: What? Thatâs terrible!

Phoebe: No-no, we do it every year!

Chandler: Oh well, that makes it not terrible.

Phoebe: No, yeah, we never find them! Sheâs always best at us that wily minx.

Rachel: Donât worry, weâre just gonna search here for an hour, them weâre gonna go over to Joeyâs and search, OK?

Chandler: No not okay, you canât look for Monicaâs presents!

Phoebe: But we have to!

Chandler: No, you donât have to, and you canât because I live here too.

Phoebe: Well then, you should look with us.

Chandler: Why?

Rachel: Chandler, arenât you worried about what to get Monica for Christmas?

Chandler: No, I have a great idea for a present for her.

Phoebe: Oh, thatâs it? (Mimics Chandler) A great idea!

Rachel: Chandler, thatâs not enough. I mean what if she gets you a great present, two medium presents, and a bunch of little presents? And youâve just gotten her one great present? I mean thatâs just gonna make her feel bad. Why would you do that to her Chandler? Why? Why?

Chandler: If I help, we can find âem faster!

Rachel: Thatâs right!

(Phoebe looks under the couch)

Phoebe: Ooh ooh, we have a live one!

Rachel: Oh, itâs a Macyâs bag!

(Phoebe tips it upside down, and a shoe falls out)

Phoebe: Ooh, whoâs it for?

Rachel: (Reading) Dear losers, do you really think Iâd hide presents under the couch? P.S. Chandler, I knew theyâd break you.

Phoebe: Uh-oh. She may be onto us.

Rachel: We are so gonna find them this year.

Chandler: Yâknow when you guys said you were gonna go across the hall and look, you donât, you donât do that every year do you?

Rachel: Yeah.

Chandler: You donât, like go into the back of my closet, and look under my gym bag or anything?

Phoebe and Rachel: No, we never do that

(They turn away.)

Chandler: Because thatâs where Joey gave me some stuff to store that Iâve never seen before in my life! Okay, that did not just happen! (He does a weird clicky motion with his fingers, that kinda hard to describe.)

[Scene: The Set, everyone is dancing.]

Monica: Okay, here comes another camera.

Ross: Right. No biggie. Stay loose.

(As the camera passes by, they start to dance really rigid, but the camera is facing the other way.)

Ross: Why do they keep doing that?

Monica: If we wanna get on camera, I think we have to get up on one of those platforms. Theyâve been taping those people up there all day.

Ross: Right.

(They move towards a platform, dancing really strangely as they go)

Ross: Hey, whatâd you guys do to get up on there?

Girl: We learned how to dance.

Monica: Oh yeah? Well when you learned how to dance did you forget how to put on underpants?

Ross: Yeah!

(Camera pans to Joey and Janine)

Janine: Hey! Youâre a good dancer!

Joey: Really?

Janine: Yeah, well youâd be better if you just loosened your hips a little.

Joey: What do you mean?

Janine: Like this.

(She pulls Joey towards her and dances really close to him.)

Janine: Thatâs it, feel the rhythm. Thatâs better.

Joey: Uh-huh.

Director: (To Joey) Okay, youâre dancing with that girl over there.

Joey: No-no-no-no-no we came together!

Director: I donât see it. (To Janine) You are dancing with the tall guy over there. Tall guy, raise your hand! (He does. Janine goes over to him.)

Joey: No-no hey buddy, please let me dance with that girl, I really like her and I think I have a shot.

Director: Really, yâthink so? I donât..

(He leaves, and this girl grabs Joey and starts dancing really wild.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment, Phoebe and Rachel are there and Chandler enters.]

Chandler: I couldn't find anything at Joey--Hey-hey, oh hey!

Rachel: Yeah, we found them. There were in the guest room closet behind some coats.

Phoebe: Yeah, and you have nothing to worry about 'cos they're all crap!

Chandler: Those are my gifts, I got them for you.

Phoebe: Ohhh. Thanks Chandler they're great!

Rachel: Well Chandler, what is this very weird, metal A Z thing?

Chandler: Those are book ends! That's a great gift!

Phoebe: Oh, okay, I'm sorry, thank you for my azzz.

Rachel: Ha!

Chandler: Make sure you put all that stuff back in the closet, okay?

Rachel: Yes, okay, oh, by the way, I just gotta say, I think it's really nice of you that even after you've moved, you still keep storing that stuff for Joey!

(Chandler does the weird clicky thing again.)

[Scene: The Set, the girl is still dancing with Joey.]

Joey: Hey-hey dancer girl! Can I go to the bathroom? I just.. (The girl starts dancing really close to him, so he picks her up, twirls her round, and puts her against a platform) Here we go. (He walks away to find Monica and Ross doing a really out of place dance) Looking good Gellers!

Ross: We know!

Monica: Hey, see that snippy guy over there? Heâs the one who decides who gets up on the platform. We should go dance by him.

Ross: Okay.

(They dance over to him.)

Director: Okay, everybody hold!

(Ross and Monica high-five)

Director: Next on the platforms areâ¦ (He points to the right of Ross and Monica, so they dance over to where heâs pointing to. He points away from them) â¦you two! Andâ¦ (He points the other way, and Ross and Monica follow his arm. Again he points away.) â¦You two!

Monica: Excuse me, sir, would it help if I werenât wearing underpants?

Ross: Monica! (Pause) Would it?

(The director shakes his head.)

[Scene: The Menâs Bathroom, the tall guy is there as Joey enters.]

Joey: Hey! Tall guy! Hey, listen, I wanted to talk to you about that girl that youâre dancing with.

Tall Guy: Sheâs nice, huh? To think I almost brought my wife to this!

Joey: Yeah, yeah, okay. Uh, look buddy, I came with that girl, and I had this plan to kiss her at the new years countdown â Iâm trying to win her over, so I was wondering if..

Tall Guy: No I donât think so.

Joey: Oh come on man, you can dance with my partner, sheâs real, uh, mellow!

Tall Guy: Look, are you dating this girl you came with?

Joey: Well, I was hoping after tonight that maybe I could you knowâ¦

Tall Guy: No, no. Sheâs fair game if you ask me, sorry buddy!

Joey: Alright, alright, hey yâknow fair is fair, (he pretends to wash his hands) if youâre right, youâre right, what can I say, but hey oh no! (He throws water on the guyâs pants)

Tall Guy: God! What are you, in second grade?

Joey: Hey, now youâre the one who wet his pants. (He throws another handful on him and runs out)

[Scene: The Set, Monica and Ross are dancing.]

Monica: Man, this sucks! Yâknow if Mom and Dad donât see us on TV after we made them so jealous, I mean, whoâs gonna be the losers then?

Ross: Hey, I know whatâll get us up on a platform!

Monica: What?

Ross: The routine!

Monica: Ross, we havenât done the routine since middle school.

Ross: Hey, when the snippy guy sees the routine, heâll wanna build us our own platform!

Monica: Was it really that good?

Ross: We got honourable mention in the brother/sister dance category! Look, itâs almost fake midnight, do we really have any other choice?

Monica: Okay, letâs do it. Mom and Dad are gonna be so faced!

(They move into a space, and Ross points to his eyes and then to hers)

Monica: 5 6 7 8!

(They start the routine. However hard I try, I really cannot describe it. You will have to watch it. Iâm sorry.)

(When they finish, they walk over to the director)

Ross: So, do we really have to ask whoâs going up on the platform next?

Director: Oh no! You get up there and do that again exactly like that!

Monica: Yes! (They run over to a platform)

Director: (To Cameraman) Make sure you get this, theyâre gonna want it for the bloopers show. (To everyone) Alright cut! Listen up everyone, when we start again itâs gonna be the countdown to new years, so I wanna see everybodyâs excitement.

[Cut to Joey and Janine]

Tall Guy: Hey, pal, you have about three seconds to get away from my partner.

Director: Whatâs going on over here?

Joey: Uh, take a look at the guyâs pants! I mean, I know you told us to show excitement, but donât you think he went a little overboard?

Director: Whatâs the matter with you? Get out of here!

Joey: Yeah, take a hike wetpants!

(The director pushes the Tall Guy away)

[Cut to Ross and Monica, who are finally on a platform!]

Ross: Can you believe this? Weâre gonna be on the platform for the Millennium moment!

Monica: I know! Hey, you havenât been practising the routine, have you?

Ross: No!

Monica: Me too!

Ross: Hey, when the music starts up again, I was thinking of maybe goind into the robot, yâknow? (He mimics a robot)

Monica: Ross, I think we should stick to the routine, we donât wanna look stupid!

Director: Alright weâre back! Ten seconds left here we go! Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! (He continues to count as we hear Joey think)

Joeyâs Head: Okay, it all comes down to this. Whatever happens, happens. Destiny.

All: Three, Two, One!

Director: Cut!

Joey: No! Year! Happy No Year!

Director: Okay, hereâs where we go to the live shot of Times Square, nice work everyone thatâs a wrap!

[Scene: Monica and Chandlerâs apartment, Chandler and Rachel are there, and Phoebe enters with the Chick and the Duck.]

Phoebe: Hey! Look who I found!

Chandler: Oh, hey guys!

Phoebe: Yâknow, birds have a very good sense of direction, and I thought maybe they could help us find where the presents are hidden.

Chandler: Yes, if the presents are hidden south for the winter.

Phoebe: Or we could just follow your clever jokes â any ideas? No! Didnât think so! Okay, câmon guys, show us where the presents are!

Chandler: Oh, the duck seems to think that Monica got me garbage! Hmm, I wonder what I could get Monica thatâs as good as garbage?

Phoebe: Hmm, how about my azzz?

(Rachel sits on the window seat, and knocks against it)

Rachel: Hey, this is hollow.

Phoebe: What?

Rachel: This bench, itâs hollow! I canât believe I never knew that! (She pushes all the pillows off it and opens it up) Oh, the presents!!!

Phoebe: No, donât look directly at them!

Chandler: What?

Phoebe: Alright, no, we could look at them!

Rachel: Oh, this oneâs for me!

Phoebe: Oh, this oneâs for Chandler. Here.

Chandler: Oh great!

Phoebe: And the big oneâs for me!

Rachel: Ooh, letâs open them!

Chandler: Okay! Okay! Okay!

Phoebe: Hee hee!

Chandler: Wait, we canât do this.

Phoebe and Rachel: Why?

Chandler: I donât wanna know what Monica got me. Yâknow? I mean, look, Iâm sure she worked really hard at getting you a present, and wanting to surprise me, and you guys are gonna ruin that, and I, look we have to put these back, this is not what Christmas is about.

Rachel: Whatever Linus, Iâm opening mine.

Chandler: Nobody is opening anything ok? Look, I donât know about you guys, but I wanna see the look on Monicaâs face when I give her my present, and Iâm sure she wants to see the look on my face when I get mine. So please, please, can we just, can we put them back?

Phoebe: Will you get us better gifts?

Chandler: Fine!

(Monica enters, and they throw the gifts behind them.)

Monica: Hey guys! You found the presents? Chandler, you let them find the presents? Great! Do you know how long it took me to find you that water purifier?

Chandler: Thatâs what you got me?

Phoebe: Oh yes, I see what you mean. That look is priceless.

(Rachel leans over to look at him.)

[Scene: Joey and Janineâs apartment, they both enter.]

Joey: Home sweet home, huh? Nice to, uh, get back to reality. Plus we know how the New Yearâs gonna go off. I guess thereâs no reason for all that Y2K panic, yâknow? Anyway, gânight!

Janine: Joey.

Rachel: Monica look! Look-look-look! Here is that table that I ordered. (Shows her the picture.)

Monica: You got it from Pottery Barn?!

Joey: (indignant) I was tired!

Rachel: Phoebe hates Pottery Barn?!

Rachel: Well this has story behind it! I mean they had to ship it all the way from the White Plains store.

Joey: Blah?!

Janine: Well yâknow, heâs blah, sheâs justâsheâs very loud for such a small person.

Joey: Uh, theyâre like my best friends. Are you saying we canât hang out with them? âCause that would kinda be a problem.

Janine: No! Of course we can still hang out with them. Just yâknow, not two nights in a row. Okay?

Joey: I guess.

Janine: Thank you. (They kiss.)

Joey: If you want, Iâll sell my friends and use the money to buy you presents.

Rachel: Guess!

Phoebe: Umm, a flea market?

Rachel: Ha! See, I knew, I knew youâd get it on the first guess. Isnât it cool! Itâs an apothecary table.

Phoebe: Wow! Oh you can just imagine that this is where (Sheâs opening and closing the drawers) they kept all the stuff to make their potions.

Rachel: Ohh, yes.

Phoebe: Yâknow? Ooh, you can almost smell the opium.

Rachel: Almost.

Phoebe: How much was it?

Rachel: It was only 500 bucks.

Phoebe: 500 bucks at a flea market?!

Rachel: Oh, okay see I thought, I thought you meant how much was it when it was new, yâknow like back then.

Phoebe: Oh no.

Rachel: Yeah no, I mean it was at a flea market, so it was yâknow, it was like a dollar.

Rachel: And fifty. So it was like one and fifty dollars.

Phoebe: Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing.

Rachel: Yeah.

Rachel: Uh, itâs from yore. Like the days of yore. Yâknow?

Rachel: I know you did! I bought the same one! And if she sees your table sheâs gonna know that I lied to her. I told her ours was an original.

Ross: Why did you do that?

Rachel: Because she hates Pottery Barn.

Ross: She hates Pottery Barn?!!

Rachel: I know! I know, she says itâs all mass-produced, nothing is authentic, and everyone winds up having the same stuff. (Ross looks at his table.) So come on, sheâs gonna be here any second! Can we please just cover this up with something?! Please?

Ross: What? No! No! I am not gonna hide it from PhoebeâOoh, although I did get some great Pottery Barn sheets! (Gets them.)

Rachel: Ooo! Oh, I forgot they made sheets!

Ross: Uh, yeah! I still canât believe she hates Pottery Barn!

Rachel: Ross, get over it! Itâs not like she hates you.

Ross: Yeah but Pottery Barn! Yâknow what I think? Itâs just she-sheâs weird. Yâknow itâs because sheâs a twin. Twins are weird.

Rachel: Ross, sheâs not weird, she just wants her stuff to be one of a kind.

Ross: Huh. Yâknow whatâs not one of a kind? A twin!

Monica: Joey! Why is Janine not coming over for dinner?!

Joey: Well uh, she didnât want to hang out with you guys two nights in a row. Iâm so sorry.

Chandler: Well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!

Joey: Because she uh, she-she thinks that you are blah and that you, Monica, are too loud.

Monica: (loudly) What?!! (Quietly) What?

Chandler: So she was just pretending to have a good time last night? She was lying to our faces?!

Monica: Ugh, I can not believe this! I mean, who is she to judge us? We could not have been nicer to her!

Chandler: And I am not blah, I am a hoot!

Joey: I know! I know! Come on, please-please you guys, donât-donât be mad. Iâm sure she just, she just said that stuff because she was nervous and you guys are like my best friends! Yâknow? And it was our first date! Plus, sheâs really sick!

Chandler: No, you shâNo you said you made that up!!

Joey: I know, but donât you think the sick thing is way better than the play thing?

Chandler: Eh, theyâre both good. I generally just go with, Monicaâs drunk again. (Monica glares at him.)

Rachel: Ohh!!

Ross: My apothecary table!!!

Phoebe: What?!

Rachel: Noooooo!! (Phoebe lifts up the sheet to discover the exact same apothecary table they have.)

Phoebe: Ross, where did you get this?!

Ross: I got it at Pottery Barn!! Okay?!

Rachel: Oh my God, Phoebe, Pottery Barn has ripped off the design of our antique!

Phoebe: Wow! Oh my God, well if theyâve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!

Rachel: Oh yes.

Phoebe: Well this doesnât even smell like opium.

Monica: We owe you?!

Joey: Thatâs right! I helped you guys out a lot in the start of your relationship. Huh? I helped you guys sneak around for like six months, and I looked like an idiot! And I was humiliated. And I only made 200 dollars!

Monica: We didnât give you any money! (Chandler is motioning, "No!")

Joey: You donât think I know that!

[Scene: Phoebe and Rachel's, Rachel is showing Ross around the newly decorated living room.]

Rachel: â¦see I canât decide whether it would go better next to the new wicker dining chair, the Sahara desk, or the Parker console table.

Ross: Wow! I didnât know that there was a Pottery Barn up here.

Rachel: I know, I know. I went a little crazy.

Ross: A little? Your place looks like page 72 of the catalogue. Oh look at that! The ornamental bird cage! Large!

Phoebe: (entering) Hey!

Rachel: Hey.

Phoebe: (sees Ross) Oh Ross no. Be careful, that is very old! Okay? Early Colonial bird merchants used to bring their birds to market in that.

Ross: (glaring at Rachel) Fascinating.

Phoebe: (gasps) Another amazing find! Wow! Oh I bet this has a great story too!

Rachel: Oh it does, it does! It is a room separating apparatus from Colonial times.

Phoebe: Ah!

Ross: Hmm, a lot of this stuff is from Colonial times. Hey, what are some other time periods Rachel? (She glares at him.)

Rachel: Well thereâs yore. And uh, yâknow, yesteryear.

Phoebe: Yeah no, Iâm telling you Rachel has such a great eye for this stuff. Ross, yâknow if you ever decide you need to redecorateâAnd I think that you should. You should, you should ask Rachel to help.

Rachel: Oh honey he doesnât need my help.

Phoebe: Oh, come on! I think heâs ready to get rid of, what did you call it? The cheap knock-offs and dinosaur junk.

Ross: Really?! (To Rachel) Hey, yâknow what? Since you have such a great sense of what I need, uh ooh, hereâs-hereâs 60 bucks, why donât you take Phoebe down to that Colonial flea market of yours and get me some stuff.

Rachel: (not sure of what to do) Yâknow what? I donât, I donât think Phoebe really wants to come.

Phoebe: No! I do want to!

Rachel: Oh, she does want to.

Ross: She does want to.

Phoebe: Yeah!

[Scene: The Street, Phoebe and Rachel are heading back from that Colonial flea market.]

Rachel: Yeah.

(They walk by a Pottery Barn window display.)

Phoebe: Uck, look at this! Pottery Barn, yuck!

Rachel: Yeah, yâknow what? Donât look at it. (Realizes the display is their living room) Seriously, donât look at it. (Tries to pull Phoebe away.)

Phoebe: No! Look-look! Thereâs the coffee table they stole from us!

Rachel: Ugh, those bastards! Letâs go.

Phoebe: That fan kinda looks like ours. And the birdcage and theâ¦wait a sec! This is our exact living room!

Rachel: No! No! No! No itâs not! No itâs not! Come on! Phoebe, ours is totally different! I mean we donât have theâ¦ (Looks desperately for something different.) We donât have theâ¦that lamp! And-and that screen is yâknow, on the other side.

Phoebe: Oh my God. This is where you got all our stuff, Pottery Barn! Oh my God!

Rachel: Okay! Okay-okay lookâno I did, I just wanted this stuff and I know how you feel about Pottery Barn. Justâ¦ Come on donât be mad.

Phoebe: No-no-no, but I am mad! I am mad! Because this stuff is everything that is wrong with the world! And itâs all sitting up in my living room and all I can think about is how I donât have that lamp!

Rachel: Well then honey, buy the lamp! Hey, we have that 60 bucks from Ross.

Phoebe: I canât! I canât! Unlessâ¦ Well are you saying that-that you would move out if-if I didnât buy that lamp?

Rachel: What?! No! Iâm not gonna move out!

Phoebe: But are you saying that you would move out if I didnât buy that lamp?

Rachel: (gets it) Oh. Yes! I would so move out!

Phoebe: Okay then I donât have a choice! I have to buy that lamp!

Rachel: Thatâs right!

Janine: Well I did. I really did. And you guys, Iâve got to say, Iâm sorry if I was a little weird after the last time we went out. I guess I was just nervous or something.

Chandler: Thatâs totally understandable.

Monica: Donât worry about it.

Janine: So we can go out again?

Janine: We have got to move!

Monica: (bursting in) I knew it!! Yâknow, youâre not so quiet yourself, missy!

Chandler: And Iâm blah? Listen, the only thing more boring than watching modern dance is having to listen to you talk about it, (Imitating her) "Oh Chandler, I just lost myself in the moment."

Janine: Yâknow, I know youâre talking, but all I hear is, "Blah. Blah. Blah-blah-blah."

Monica: (steps up and points at her) All right! You and me! Letâs go! Right now!

Joey: All right! All right! Enough! Enough! Enough!! Enough! (To Chandler and Monica) You two go home! I-I-I gotta talk to Janine! (They start to leave.)

Chandler: (To Monica) Yâknow I think you can take her.

Monica: (to Janine) Youâd better hope I donât see you in the hallway!! (They exit.)

Joey: All right, uh, weâve got a little bit of a problem here. These people are my friends; you canât treat them that way.

Janine: They said stuff to me too, yâknow!

Joey: I know! I know! And Iâm going to talk to them about it. They mean so much to me. Theyâ¦ Theyâre like my family. If you guys are gonna be fighting all the time, I-Iâ¦ I donât think we can be together. It just, it just canât work. It canât. (Starts to break up) Iâm very upset.

Janine: Okay. Okay. Would, would it help if I went over and apologized?

Joey: Yeah! Yeah! That would be very helpful! Yeah. (He opens the door for her and she exits into the hallway.)

[Cut to the hallway, Janine is entering as Monica is taking out the garbage.]

Monica: What did I tell you about the hall?!

Janine: I was just coming over here to apologize for my behavior! Iâd really like it if we could be friends.

Monica: Well, I know that would make Joey happy, so, I would like that too.

Janine: Great.

Monica: Now come on. (They hug like men.) Well, Iâm glad we worked things out.

Janine: Me too.

Monica: Okay.

Janine: Iâll see you.

Monica: Bye. (Leaves to resume her garbage removal task.)

Ross: Hey, youâre not going to believe this. I made up a joke and sent it in to Playboy. They printed it!

Phoebe: I didnât know Playboy prints jokes.

Ross: Yeah, they print jokes, interviews, hard-hitting journalism. Itâs not just about the pictures.

Monica: That didnât work on mom, itâs not going to work on us.

Ross: (showing them the page) Here, check it out. Itâs the first one, too.

(They all laugh indifferently, except Chandler, whoâs a little angry.)

Chandler: That is funny. It was also funny when I made it up.

Ross: What?

Chandler: I made that joke up.

Ross: Uh, oh-oh, no you didnât. I did.

Chandler: Yes, I did. I told it to Dan at work, and he said it was the funniest joke heâd ever heard.

Ross: Hey, tell Dan, âThanks.â

(Rachel is looking at the magazine and laughing.)

Ross: What?

Rachel: Iâm sorry, I was just reading the joke below it. Man, that one is funny. (Ross grabs the magazine away from her.)

Chandler: Monica, you remember me telling you that joke, right?

Monica: No.

Chandler: Seriously?

Monica: Well, you tell a lot of jokes!

Ross: Look, Chandler, itâs my joke. But, hey, if it makes you feel any better they donât print the name, so it doesnât really matter who gets credit, right?

Chandler: Yeah, I guess.

Joey: (entering) Hey guys.

Chandler: (jumping up from his chair) Hey, Joey, Playboy printed my joke.

Ross: No, itâs my joke, itâs mine. You can call them, theyâll tell you.

Chandler: Itâs my joke.

Ross: Itâs my joke.

Joey: Whoa-whoa-whoa. Jokes? You guys know they have naked chicks in there, right?

Opening Credits

[Scene: Joeyâs apartment, Joey is sitting at the counter as Chandler enters.]

Chandler: Dude, you have got to turn on Behind the Music. The band Heart is having a really tough time, and I think they may break up.

Joey: Letâs go watch it at your place.

Chandler: Nah, Monicaâs watching some cooking show. Come on, I donât want to miss when they were skinny.

Joey: Chandler, Chandler, yâknow what we should do? You and I should go out and get some new sunglasses.

Chandler: What? No, I want to watch this. (He turns on the television and the screen is completely covered in snow). Did your cable go out?

Joey: No, thatâs VH-1. I gotta tell you, the music these kids listen to today . . . Itâs like a lotta noise to me. I donât knowâ¦

Chandler: Joey, why is your cable out?

Joey: I uh, oh! Because, uh, I havenât really paid the bill

Chandler: If you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you some money?

Joey: No, Chandler. Look, forget about it, okay? Look, I know things have been a little tight since Janine moved out. Oh, was she hot.

Chandler: Whoa ho.

Joey: I know! Yeah, but, look I can handle it. All right? Look, I can listen to the radio, huh? And Ross gave me this great book (holds up the Playboy magazine).

Chandler: (picks up the phone) All right, you want to see if the joke stealer will let us watch the show at his place?

Joey: Sure.

Chandler: (with phone to ear, obviously hearing no dial tone) Paid your phone bill?

Joey: Not so much.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica and Rachel are on the couch looking at the Playboy magazine. When they hear someone coming, Monica goes to hide it under the sofa cushions.]

Phoebe: (entering) Hey.

Monica: (relieved) Itâs only you.

Phoebe: Wh-wh-what are you doing?

Rachel: We are looking at a Playboy.

Phoebe: Oh, I want to look too! (She runs over and sits down and checks out a picture). Yikes!

Monica: So do you think that these picturesâAre, are they trying to tell a story?

Rachel: Oh, yeah, sure. I mean, like in the case of this young woman, she has lost her clothes, so she rides naked on the horse, sheâs crying out, âWhere are they, where are they?â

Monica: Well, sheâs not going to find them lying in the grass like that.

(They flip through the pages to another picture.)

Phoebe: Oh, yeah. Aw, remember the days when you used to go out to the barn, lift up your shirt, and bend over?

Rachel and Monica: Yeah.

Rachel: You see, now, I would date this girl. Sheâs cute, sheâs outdoorsy, you know, and she knows how to build a fire. I mean, thatâs got to come in handy

Monica: Okay, Iâve got a question. If you had to pick one of us to date, who would it be?

Rachel: (thinks) I donât know.

Monica: Me neither.

Phoebe: Rachel.

Monica: What?!

Phoebe: I donât know. (Pause) Me neither.

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Chandler, and Ross are sitting on the couch.]

Joey: You forget how many great songs Heart had.

Chandler: Yeah.

Ross: You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.

Chandler: So, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.

Joey: Oh, you guys, with this joke. I gotta say, I know I cracked up, but Iâm not even sure I got it.

Ross: What, you didnât get it? The doctor is a monkey.

(He and Chandler crack up.)

Chandler: And monkeys canât write out prescriptions.

(He and Ross crack up again. Joey just sits there)

Chandler: (stops laughing, to Ross) You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.

Ross: Your joke? Well, I think âthe Hefâ would disagree, which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah-dollars.

Chandler: So, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.

Ross: Well, I was going to stick it in the ATM, but now I think Iâll show the sexy teller that I am a published writer.

Chandler: Well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.

Ross: Oh, what are you going to do, follow me down there?

Chandler: Yeah!

Ross: Well, Iâm not going to go now anyway (he goes to sit down).

Chandler: Okay (he goes to sit down).

(Ross leaps out of his chair and runs out the door, with Chandler in hot pursuit.)

Gunther: (handing Joey the bill) Here you go.

Joey: Ah, Gunther, I canât pay for this right now because Iâm not working, so Iâve had to cut down on some luxuries like uh, payinâ for stuff.

Gunther: Well, if you want, you can work here.

Joey: Uh, I donât know. Ya see, itâs just, see I was a regular on a soap opera yâknow? And to go from that to this, I justâ¦ Plus, Iâd have to wait on all my friends.

Gunther: Okay, but the moneyâs good, plus you get to stare at Rachel as much as you want.

Joey: What?!

Gunther: Flexible hours.

Joey: Maybe I could be a waiter. Could I use the phone?

[Scene: Monica and Chandlerâs bedroom, they are in bed together.]

Monica: (visibly upset) She picked Rachel. I mean, she tried to back out of it, but it was obvious. She picked Rachel.

Chandler: (visibly upset) He took my joke, he took it.

Monica: Itâs wrong. You know what else is wrong? Phoebe picking Rachel.

Chandler: You know who else picked Rachel? Ross, and you know what else Ross did? He stole my joke. You know what? Iâm going to get a joke journal. Yâknow? And document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.

Monica: Thatâs a good idea.

Chandler: Yeah!

Monica: Do you know whatâs a bad idea?

Chandler: Picking Rachel.

Monica: Thatâs right. (A noise comes from the living room.) Did you hear something?

Chandler: Maybe itâs the sound of Ross climbing into my brain and stealing my thoughts.

Monica: Itâs coming from the living room.

(They go out to investigate, and find Joey wrapped in a blanket watching their television.)

Joey: (sheepishly) I finished my book. (Chandler and Monica slowly retreat back to bed.)

[Scene, Phoebe and Rachelâs, theyâre sitting together on the couch.]

Monica: (entering) Hey, you guys.

Phoebe and Rachel: Hey.

Monica: (laughing) Oh, donât you guys look cute. You guys make such a cute couple.

Rachel: Monica, what are you doing?

Monica: (laughing harder) Nothing, Iâm just trying to recreate some of the fun that we had at my place the other day. (To Phoebe) Remember, when you picked Rachel over me? That was funny.

Phoebe: I guess it was kinda funny.

Monica: (angrily) It wasnât funny at all! Why would you do that? Why didnât you pick me?

Phoebe: Fine. The reason that I was leaning a little bit more toward Rachel than you is just that youâre â¦ just â¦ kinda high maintenanceâOkay letâs go to lunch!

Monica: That is completely untrue. You think Iâm high maintenance? Okay, prove it. I want you to make a list and weâre going to go through it point by point!

Phoebe: No, okay, youâre right. Youâre easy-going. Youâre just not as easy-going as Rachel. Sheâs just more flexible and-and mellow. Thatâs all.

Rachel: (To Monica) Well, people are different.

Phoebe: Ya, you know, Rachel â¦ sheâll do whatever you want. Yâknow, you can just walk all over her.

Rachel: What? Wait a minute. What are you saying, that Iâm a pushover? Iâm not a pushover.

Phoebe: Oh, okay, (laughing) youâre not a pushover.

Rachel: Oh my â¦ you think Iâm a pushover. Well wait, watch this, you know what? Youâre not invited to lunch. What do you think of that? I think thatâs pretty strong, thatâs what I think. Come on, Monica, letâs go to lunch. (She leaves)

Monica: (to Phoebe) You start working on that list. (She grabs her coat and leaves, too.)

[Cut to the hallway.]

Rachel: I cannot believe her.

Monica: I know. Where do you wanna go eat?

Rachel: Oh, oh, I love that Japanese place.

Monica: Iâm sick of Japanese. Weâre not going there.

Rachel: All right, wherever you wanna go is cool.

Monica: All right.

[Scene: Central Perk, Monica, Rachel, and Chandler are there as Ross enters and sees Gunther.]

Ross: (showing the Playboy magazine to Gunther) Oh, hey, Gunther, check this out.

(Gunther looks at the joke and laughs.)

Gunther: Yeah, that-that Chandler cracks me up.

(Ross begins to say something, realizes what Gunther just said, turns, and glares at Chandler. Chandler just shrugs it off.)

Joey: Hey Ross, listen, you want anything to drink, âcause Iâm heading up there.

Ross: Uh, yeah, Iâll take a coffee. Thanks, man.

Joey: Sure. (To Monica and Rachel) Coffee? âCause Iâm going up there.

Rachel: No.

Monica: No, thank you.

Joey: (to a table of strangers) You guys need anything, âcause Iâm heading up there.

Woman: Iâd love an ice water.

Joey: You got it.

Monica: Joey, what are you doing?

Joey: Just being friendly. (He gives Monica a âwhatâs wrong with you?â look and proceeds to walk behind the counter.)

Rachel: Joey, honey, I donât think youâre supposed to go back there.

Joey: Nah, itâs okay. Right, Gunther? (Winks at him as if theyâre in on a secret together.)

Gunther: Donât wink at me. And put on your apron.

Joey: Okay, but I donât see you asking any other paying customers to put on aprons.

Monica: Joey, do you work here?

Joey: No.

Customer: Hey, waiter.

Joey: Yeah?

Commercial Break

[Scene: Central Perk, continued from earlier.]

Monica: Joey, whatâs going on. What didnât you tell us you work here?

Joey: Itâs kind of embarrassing, yâknow. I mean, I was an actor and now Iâm a waiter. Itâs supposed to go in the other direction.

Chandler: So is your apron. Youâre wearing it like a cape.

Joey: I mean, the jobâs easy and the moneyâs good, you know? I guess Iâm going to be hanging out here anyway. I might as well get paid for it, right? I just feel kind of weird serving you guys.

Rachel: Come on, Joey, I did it and it was fine.

Ross: Yeah, why would it be weird? Hey, Joey, can I get some coffee?

Joey: Okay, I guess it doesnât seem that weird.

Ross: Seriously, I-I asked you before and you still havenât gotten it.

Joey: See, now itâs weird again.

Chandler: I think itâs great that you work here. Youâre going to make a lot of money, and hereâs your first tip: Donât eat yellow snow. (He laughs, then picks up a pen, glares at Ross, and writes in his journal). Ah ha ha, 2:15, coffeehouse.

Rachel: Well, you know what? This is great. Finally, I have someone I can pass on my wisdom too. Let me tell you about a couple of things I learned while working at the coffeehouse. First of all, the customer is always right. (Joey nods.) A smile goes a long way. (Joey smiles) And if anyone is ever rude to you? Sneeze muffin.

Joey: Thanks, Rach. Look, you guys are just terrific. Yâknow? Now, how about clearing out of here so I can get some new customers. Itâs all about turnover.

Ross: Joey, seriously, can I get my coffee?

Joey: Oh, Iâm sorry, Ross. Iâll get it for you right now. And since I made you wait, Iâll toss in a free muffin.

(He looks at Rachel and winks, she gives him the thumbs-up sign.)

[Scene: Phoebe and Rachelâs, Phoebe is sitting on the couch as Rachel and Monica enter.]

Rachel: Phoebe. We would like to talk to you for a second.

Phoebe: Okay.

Monica: So, maybe I am a little high maintenance. And maybe Rachel is a little bit of a pushover. But you know what we decided you are?

Rachel: Yes, we are very sorry to tell you this, but you, Phoebe, are flaky.

Monica: Hah!

Phoebe: That true, I am flaky.

Rachel: So, what, youâre just, youâre just okay with being flaky?

Phoebe: Yeah, totally.

Monica: Well, then, Iâm okay with being high maintenance.

Rachel: Yeah, and I am okay with being a pushover.

Phoebe: Thatâs great. Good for you guys.

Monica: I am not high maintenance!

Rachel: I am not a pushover!

Phoebe: Who said you were?

Monica and Rachel: You did!

Phoebe: Oh, Iâm flaky. Iâll say anything.

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is coming back from using the phone.]

Joey: Hey, Gunther. Can you uh, can you cover for me? I just got an audition.

Gunther: No, Iâm leaving to get my hair dyed.

Joey: Really?! I like your natural color. Come on man, itâs a great part. Look, check it out. Iâm the lead guyâs best friend and I wait for him in this bar and save his seat. Listen-listen. âIâm sorry, that seatâs saved.â

Gunther: Thatâs the whole part?

Joey: Okay, maybe heâs not his best friend, but â¦

Gunther: Okay, Iâll see you in an hour.

Joey: Oh, man, I could totally get that part. âIâm sorry, that seat is taken.â

Patron: Oh, excuse me.

Joey: No, no, I didnât mean you. But, you believed me, huh?

Patron: I believed you were saving this seat for someone.

Joey: So, youâd hire me, right?

Patron: For what?

Joey: Exactly! All right, everybody, listen up. The coffeehouse is going to be closed for about an hour.

Customers: Huh? What?

Joey: Yeah, itâs for the kids. To keep the kids off drugs. Itâs a very important issue in this monthâs Playboy. Iâm sure you all read about it.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler and Ross are both pouting and sitting on the couch.]

Ross: Itâs my joke.

Chandler: Itâs my joke.

Ross and Chandler: Itâs my joke.

Ross: Yâknow, I donât think weâre going to settle this.

Chandler: Letâs have Monica decide.

Ross: Yeah!

Chandler: Yeah!

Ross: Hey Mon.

Chandler: Mon, get out here!

Ross: Monica! (She appears, not sure why she was summoned.)

Chandler: Okay, okay. You have to help us decide whose joke this is.

Monica: Why do I have to decide?

Chandler: Because youâre the only one that can be fair.

Ross: Yeah.

Monica: I canât be fair. Youâre my boyfriend.

Ross: Yeah, but Iâm your brother. Weâre family. Thatâs the most important thing in the world.

Chandler: (to Ross) Donât try to sway her. (To Monica) (Softly) Iâm your only chance to have a baby. Okay, letâs go.

Ross: Weâll each tell you how we came up with the joke and then you decide which one of us is telling the truthâme.

Monica: Okay, Chandler, you go first.

Chandler: Okay, I thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with Steve.

Monica: Oh, wait, is he the guy I met at Christmas?

Chandler: Can I finish my story?!

Monica: Do you want me to pick you?!

Ross: See, I would never snap at you like that.

(Chandler motions to Monica that heâll give her two babies.)

Monica: Continue.

Chandler: So Steve said he had to go to the doctor. And Steveâs doctorâs name is Doctor Muppy. So I said, âDoctor Monkey?â And that is how the whole Doctor Monkey thing came up. (He slams his feet up on the table to emphasize his point.)

Ross: Are you kidding? Okay, look. I-I studied evolution. Remember, evolution? Monkey into man? Plus, Iâm a doctor, and I had a monkey. Iâm Doctor Monkey!

Chandler: Iâm not arguing with that.

Monica: All right, Iâve heard enough. Iâve made my decision.

(Both Chandler and Ross are eager to hear her decision.)

Monica: You are both idiots. The joke is not funny, and itâs offensive to women, and doctors, and monkeys! You shouldnât be arguing over who gets credit, you should be arguing over who gets blamed for inflicting this horrible joke upon the world! Now let it go! The joke sucks!

(Monica leaves the room)

Ross: Itâs your joke.

Chandler: Is not.

[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is sitting at a table and Phoebe is on the couch. Chandler and Monica can be seen outside, sheâs lecturing him, and pushes him inside. He then nods to Rachel, and is obviously counting off the seconds in his head and then Monica makes a grand enterance.]

Monica: Hi, Chandler. There you are.

Chandler: Hi, oh hi.

Monica: Hey, itâs Phoebe and Rachel. Um, why donât you tell them what you were telling me earlier about me not being high maintenance?

(Rachel and Phoebe exchange looks.)

Chandler: (starts to recite a rehearsed speech) Monica is a self-sufficient, together lady. (Pause.) Being with her has been like being on a vacation. And what may be perceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail andâ(He falters and Monica prompts him.)âgenerosity of spirit.

Rachel: Wow, you know what? That is the best fake speech I think Iâve ever heard.

Phoebe: Really? Iâve heard better.

Monica: Wait, wait, he came up with that himself. Tell them, Chandler.

Chandler: (To Chandler) Iâm out of words. Should I just say the whole thing again?

Monica: Look, I am not high maintenance. I am not. Chandler!

Chandler: (pauses as he struggles with what he has to say) Youâre a little high maintenance.

Monica: Ahhh! You are on my list.

Chandler: Iâm sorry. Youâre not easy-going, but youâre passionate, and thatâs good. And when you get upset about the little things, I think that Iâm pretty good about making you feel better about that. And thatâs good too. So, they can say that youâre high maintenance, but itâs okay, because I like â¦ maintaining you.

Monica: (embarrassed) (To Phoebe and Rachel) I didnât even tell him to say that. (They hug). All right youâre off my list.

Chandler: (happily) Iâm off the list. (Sits on the couch.)

Monica: (sits next to him) Phoebe, itâs okay that you donât want me to be your girlfriend because I have the best boyfriend.

Phoebe: (to Monica) Yâknow, suddenly I find you very attractive.

(Joey enters.)

Chandler: Hey, buddy boy, howâd the audition go?

Joey: Not good, no. I didnât get the part, and I lost my job here, so â¦

Phoebe: Wow! That is a bad audition.

Rachel: How-how did you lose your job here?

Joey: Well, I had the audition but Gunther said I had to stay here and be in charge so he could go get his hair dyed. So, I went anyway, and then he fired me.

Rachel: He left work in the middle of the day to do a personal errand and left you in charge when youâve been working here two days? Thatâs not, thatâs not right.

Joey: Yeah, what are ya gonna do?

Rachel: Joey, you canât let him get away with that. Ya know what, Iâm not going to let him get away with that. Iâm going to say something to himâNo, I really shouldnât say anythingâNo, I should say something to him. (Goes to the counter) Gunther, I want you to give Joey his job back. That is really not fair that you have to fire himâ¦

Gunther: Okay.

Rachel: What?

Gunther: He can have his job back.

Rachel: Thatâs right, he can have his job back. Iâm glad we got that all straightened out. There you go, Joey, you got your job back.

Joey: Thatâs great. Thanks Rach.

Rachel: Yeah, pretty nice, huh? Now whoâs a pushover?

Phoebe: (returning from the bathroom) Rach, youâre in my seat.

Rachel: Oh, Iâm sorry. (Gets up and moves.)

Ending Credits

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Phoebe, and Rachel are sitting at the kitchen table, talking.]

Phoebe: Hey, I never got to hear who you guys would pick to be your girlfriend.

Monica: I pick you, Phoebe.

Rachel: Oh, yeah. Definitely you, Pheebs.

Phoebe: Yeah, well, I kinda thought.

(Phoebe gets up from the table, and while her back is turned, Rachel and Monica indicate via sign language that they each would have picked the other.)

(Joey, Chandler and Ross enter.)

Chandler: Hey.

Rachel: Hey. Oh, I have a question. If-if-if one of you had to pick one of the other two guys to go out with, who would you pick?

Ross: No way.

Joey: Iâm not answering that.

Chandler: Joey! (Pause as they all stare at him.) No way. Iâm not answering that.

Joey: Okay Rach, that muffin and espresso, $4.50. Ross, double latte, $2.75. Chandler, coffee and a scone, $4.25. And Pheebs, herbal tea, $1.25. So, all together thatâs (pauses to figure the total) $12.75.

Chandler: This coming from the man who couldnât split our 80 dollar phone bill in half.

(A good-looking woman approaches.)

Woman: Hi!

Joey: Hi!

Woman: How much do I owe you for the muffin and the latte?

Joey: Oh thatâs on the house courtesy of Joey Tribbiani.

Woman: Oh great! Well, tell him thanks. And since uh, Joey seems like such a nice guy, maybe we could go on a date sometime?

Joey: Well, heâs not used to women being so forward with him; but uh, I good check with himâHe says itâs okay. (She hands him her card.) Great! Thanks! Bye-bye!

Ross: Hey Joey, how come our stuff isnât free?

Joey: It will be when you look like that in a tight skirt! This is great! Iâm getting more dates than ever!

Rachel: Wait a minute, youâre only giving free stuff away to the pretty girls?

Phoebe: Yeah Joey that is so gross!

Joey: How about a scone on the house baby?

Phoebe: (giggles) Iâm pretty.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, everyone but Monica is there playing Monopoly.]

Ross: Hey does anyone have any gum?

Phoebe: Oh I do! (She grabs her huge purse and starts rummaging through it and taking out various items in a futile search for the gum.) Oh, yâknow what? No. (Pause) Wait a second. (She removes a bag filled with water that has a goldfish swimming in it.) I know itâs in here somewhere.

Ross: Yâknow what? Iâm good! Iâm good!

Monica: (entering) Hey!

Monica: Iâm not sick!! I donât get sick! Getting sick is for weaklings and for pansies!

Rachel: Honey, no one thinks youâre a pansy, but we do think you need a tissue. (She notices something hanging from Monicaâs nose, as does Joey.)

Monica: (wiping her nose) I have not been sick in over three years! (Sneezes.)

Chandler: Iâm gonna grab you some tissue.

Monica: I donât need a tissue! Iâm fine-d!

Ross: When you put a âDâ at the end of âFineâ youâre not fine.

Monica: Iâm fine-d. Iâm fine-d! Yâknow, itâs a really hard word to say.

(Thereâs a knock on the door. The gang is stunned and Phoebe counts to make sure that everyone is there. Out of curiosity Chandler goes and answers the door.)

Chandler: Yes?

(A woman enters.)

Woman: Hi, is Rachel here? Iâm her sister.

Rachel: Oh my God, Jill!

Jill: Oh my God, Rachel!

(They run and hug each other.)

Chandler: Oh my God, introduce us!

Rachel: This is Chandler. (Points at him.)

Jill: Hi!

Rachel: And you know Monica and Ross!

Ross: Hi Jill.

Rachel: And thatâs Phoebe (points), and thatâs Joey.

Joey: Hey, (in the Joey voice) how you doinâ?

Rachel: Donât!! (Joey backs away frightened.) (To Jill) Honey, what are you doing here?!

Phoebe: (To Ross) Which-which sister is this? Is this the spoiled one or thatâs bitter?

Jill: (To Rachel) Daddy cut me off.

Phoebe: Never mind, I got it.

Jill: And yâknow what I said to him? "Iâm gonna hire a lawyer and Iâm gonna sue you and take all your money. Then Iâm gonna cut you off!"

Rachel: Wow! What did he say?

Jill: That he wouldnât pay for my lawyer! Then he told me to come here and learn about the value of money from the one daughter heâs actually proud off.

Rachel: Oh! Did you hear that?! My dadâs proud of me! My dadâs proud of me.

Monica: Rach? (Points to Jill.)

Rachel: Oh yeah, sorry. Wait honey, so what did you do that made dad cut you off?

Jill: Okay, I bought a boat.

Monica: You bought a boat?

Jill: Yeah but it wasnât for me, it was for a friend.

Chandler: Boy did we make friends with the wrong sister! (Rachel glares at him.)

Rachel: Jill, honey, I think this is the best thing that couldâve ever happened to you. I mean you needed to get out on your own anyway! And you know when I did it, I-I-I at first I was scared, and look at me now! Iâm the only daughter dad is proud of! Okay, well this is, this is what youâre gonna do. Youâre gonna get a job, youâre gonna get an apartment, and then Iâll help you and you can stay with us. Right Pheebs, she can stay with us?

Phoebe: Of course, yeah!

Jill: Oh, thatâs so great! Okay, Iâm really gonna do this! I donât know how to thank you guys.

Phoebe: Ooh, I like cards.

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is working as Phoebe and Ross are sitting on the couch.]

Joey: (to a customer) Are you all finished here?

Customer: Yes.

Joey: Great! (Joey takes his cookie and finishes it.)

Gunther: Okay, here are the tips for this morning. Jen gets 50, 50 for me, and Joey owes eight dollars.

Joey: What?!

Gunther: For all the free food you gave away.

Joey: Well if itâs free food, how come youâre charging me for it?

Gunther: We donât give anything away unless itâs someoneâs birthday.

Joey: Well, what if they came in third in a modeling contest?

Gunther: No!

Joey: (to a woman who came in third in a modeling contest) Sorry! (He grabs her muffin away and returns it to the serving tray.)

Jill: (entering, carrying a bunch of shopping bags) I just had the hardest day. Those bags are so heavy. (Sets them down.)

Ross: Jill, how did you pay for all this? I thought your dad took away your credit card.

Jill: Oh please, I memorized those numbers when I was 15. But look at all the cool make-it-on-my-own stuff I got! (Holds up a red sweater) This is my "Please, hire me" sweater. (Holds up a pair of black pants) And these are my, "Donât you want to rent me this apartment?" pants.

Ross: I donât think charging new clothes too your dad qualifies as making it on your own.

Jill: Oh, Mr. Scientist has to get all technical!

Phoebe: Seriously, I donât Rachelâs gonna think itâs a good idea.

Jill: So who made her queen of the world?

Phoebe: I would love that job!

Rachel: (entering) Hey! Whatâs goinâ on?

Jill: Hey!

Rachel: (notices Jillâs bags) Jill! Did you shop?!

Jill: No! They did! (Points to Phoebe and Ross)

Phoebe and Ross: Yeah, we went shopping!

Rachel: You went shopping?! What, and then you just came in here and paraded it right under Jillâs nose when you know sheâs trying to quit. Wow, you guys are terrible!

Phoebe: Sorry Jill.

Ross: Sorry-sorry Jill.

Rachel: Whatâd you get?

Phoebe: Oh well, all right, I got (Ross hands her a bag) (To Ross) thank you, I got uh, this yâknow "I want a job sweater." (Holds up the same sweater.)

Rachel: Oh.

Phoebe: And, and then I got uh, these are apartment pants.

Rachel: Apartment pants?

Phoebe: Yeah, you never heard of them?

Rachel: No, of course, of course Iâve heard of them! Ross, what did you get?

Ross: Huh? Oh, I got thisâ(Holds up this pink frilly thing)âthis!

Rachel: A pajmena?

Ross: Yeah! Oh, I-I love this babies!

Rachel: Really?

Ross: Ross, wants a pajmena?

Ross: Itâs a rug. (Jill winces.)

Rachel: Jill?

Jill: (covers her eyes and starts crying) Iâm sorry Rachel, Iâm sorryâ¦

Rachel: Oh, come on! You think thatâs gonna work on me?! I invented that!

Jill: Right! But, I am sorry.

Rachel: All right, itâs okay. One little setback is okay, just donât let it happen again, all right? Now since daddy paid for all this stuff, I should take it all away. But Iâm just gonna take the-the pajmena. (Ross hands it to her.) And the uh, and the uh pants. Yâknow what, Iâm just gonna take it all away, âcause that way youâll just really learn the lesson. Okay? All righty, Iâm gonna run a couple of errands and I will see you at dinner. (Leaves with all of Jillâs stuff.)

Jill: She took all my stuff.

Ross: Yeah. Everything but, the little blue one. (Holds it up for her.)

Jill: (gasps) Thatâs the best one! Oh my God, (hugs him) thank you so much!

Ross: Well. Heyâ¦

Jill: Oh my gosh, that was so lame. Like a pajmena could be a rug!

Ross: Oh yeah, how about you and the, (mimics her fake cry) "Iâm sorry!"

Jill: (hits him) Shut up! I did not sound like that at all!

Phoebe: What about, what about when I said yâknow about the apartment pants, how dumb was I?

(They both look at her.)

Jill: Were you this cute in high school?

Ross: Oh stop.

Jill: No you stop!

Ross: No, you stop!

Jill: You stop!

Phoebe: (gets up and sits between them) Okay-okay, why donât I sit here and youâll both stop it!

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is still very sick and is entering the living room from the bathroom wearing a robe. Chandler is reading a magazine.]

Monica: Okay, so what do you, what do you want to do? Letâs do something crazy!

Chandler: I know, letâs rest and drink lots of fluids. (Holds up a glass of orange juice.)

Monica: Okay, Iâll rest. But yâknow if Iâm going to bed, then youâre coming with me.

Chandler: That would be impossible to resist if you werenât all drippy here. (Points to his nose.)

Monica: (wiping her nose) Are you saying that you donât wanna get with this? (Tries to do a little sexy body rub, but it doesnât work all that well with the big robe.)

Chandler: Yeah, I donât you should say that even when youâre healthy.

Monica: (in a sexy voice) Come on. (Coughs loudly.)

Chandler: Donât take this personally okay? Itâs just that I just canât have sex with a sick person.

Monica: Iâm with you Chandler! I mean I canât have sex with a sick person either, thatâs disgusting! But Iâm not sick! Let me prove it to you. We are two healthy people in the pribe of libe.

Chandler: Thatâs the thing, see I would like to stay in the pribe of mwha-ah-libe.

[Scene: Phoebe and Rachel's, Rachel is putting away her new clothes as Phoebe enters.]

Rachel: Hey!

Phoebe: Hey.

Rachel: Whatâs up?!

Phoebe: Umm, I think thereâs something you should maybe know.

Rachel: Well, itâd better not be about the apartment pants, because I just pitched the idea to my boss at Ralph Lauren and she loved it.

Phoebe: No. No. Itâs just I was umm, I was with Ross and Jill after you left and umm, Iâm pretty sure I saw a little spark between them.

Rachel: What?!

Phoebe: Yeah I mean itâs probably nothing, but I just wanted to warn you that there might be something there.

Rachel: With Ross and Jill?

Phoebe: Yeah!

Rachel: With Ross and my sister?

Phoebe: Yeah.

Rachel: With my sister Jill and my ex-boyfriend Ross?

Phoebe: Yeah.

Rachel: Oh there is no way.

Phoebe: Okay then.

Rachel: Oh my God! I can not believe that! I mean I donât really like it when Ross goes out with anyone, but my sister isnât that like incest or something?! Oh my God, and theyâre gonna have sex! Oh! Oh no what if he marries her too?! Oh this is just terrible, this is just terrible. And I canât stop it! I canâtâI donât own Ross! Yâknow? And Jill, she should be able to do whatever it is that she wants to do! And oh my God, I canât believe Ross is marrying my little sister, this terrible. Oh my God, this is just the worst thing that could have ever happened to me.

Phoebe: But great news about the apartment pants, huh?

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is giving the bill to the same beautiful woman from before.]

Joey: Thatâll be $3.85.

Woman: What do you mean? Yesterday you said I was too pretty to pay for stuff!

Joey: Itâs just I canât because my manager said Iâ¦ (Gets an idea) (Starts singing) "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday dear Annieâ¦

Jill: (entering) Sorry Iâm late, whatâs up?

Rachel: (on the couch) Oh hi! Yâknow, I just wanted to see if there were any leads on the old job front.

Jill: Oh no! But I just walked past three sales and I didnât go in. How strong am I?

Rachel: That is great. Hey, yâknow who doesnât have to job hunt? Ross. He works at the university.

Jill: Yeah.

Rachel: Oh so you know that, you guys talked about that, so you get along, so you think youâre gonna go out?

Jill: Me go out with Ross?! No! God no! What would make you think that?

Rachel: I just, Phoebe, said yâknow thought she saw something between you guys.

Jill: No! I mean heâs nice.

Rachel: Yeah.

Jill: Heâs the kind of guy youâre friends with, yâknow? But heâs not the kind of guy you date. Heâs the kind of guy youâd date because you did. Me, not so much.

Rachel: Oh not-not so much. Umm, what-what do you, what do you mean is there something wrong with Ross?

Jill: Oh no-no-no, heâs just I donât know, heâs just a little bookish.

Rachel: Are-are you saying heâs a geek?

Jill: You think so too?

Rachel: No! No I, no Ross is not a geek!

Jill: Fine, then letâs just say heâs not my type.

Rachel: What handsome is not your type? Smart? Kind? Good kisser? What those things arenât on your list? Ross is a great guy! You would be lucky to be with him!

Jill: Well okay, if it means that much to you, then Iâll ask him out.

Rachel: Oh no-no-no, no-no-no, thatâs not what I meant.

Jill: No! Yâknow what Rachel? Youâre right, yâknow he has been really nice to me.

Rachel: Yeah but, heâs not your type.

Jill: Yeah but maybe thatâs a good thing. Yâknow Iâm doing all these different sorts of things, and maybe I should try dating a geek too!

Rachel: Yeah but, you donât, you donât, you donât want to try to much too fast. Yâknow? I mean, you do remember what happened to the little girl that tried to much too fast donât you?

Jill: What?

Rachel: She-she died Jill.

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler has fallen asleep reading a book. Monica calls from the bedroom and wakes him up.]

Monica: (still sick) Chandler!

Chandler: Oh what is it honey, you need some tea? Some soup? (He gets up from the couch and goes into the bedroom to find Monica, still in the robe, lying seductively on the bed. Or at least sheâs trying too and as he enters the room, she takes the robe off on of her legs.) Oh-ohhhh!

Monica: (trying to be seductive) Calling Dr. Big, Dr. Big to the bed.

Rachel: Really?!

Ross: Yeah but after you said it was okay, I figured, "Why not?!"

Rachel: Oh so-so not really never.

Ross: I have to say you are a much bigger person than I am. I mean after all weâve been through, I justâyâknow I wish I had a brother to reciprocate. Hey, if you ever want to go out with Monica, you have my blessing.

Joey: (overhearing them) Oh-ho, and mine!

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica is still sick and is hobbling out into the living room for some help from Chandler whoâs on the couch reading.]

Monica: Come on! I really need your help!

Chandler: No-no-no-no-no!

Monica: Fine, Iâll rub it on myself.

Chandler: Okay.

(To start this task, she lowers the top of her robe to reveal that she is naked from the waist up, well at least her back is, and starts to rub on the gunk. Chandler notices this, and has something start happening. Iâll let you fill in the blank here.)

Chandler: So youâre just, kinda rubbing it on yourself?

Monica: Yeah?

Chandler: Itâs nice.

Monica: Are you kidding me?! Is this; is this turning you on?

Chandler: Yes! (Hangs his head in shame.)

Monica: I canât believe it! What is it? Is it the rubbing or the smell?

Chandler: Itâs all very, very good. (She covers up and sits down.) So you wanna go uh, mix it up?

Monica: Not now, Iâm sick!

Chandler: Oh come on you big faker!

Monica: What happened to your rule about never sleeping with sick people?

Ross: Something couldâve happened. All right? She-she really dug my slides. And-and she was definitely giving me the vibe.

Monica: Chandler thereâs nothing wrong with crying! I mean you donât have to be so macho all the time.

Chandler: Iâm not macho.

Monica: Yeah youâre right. I donât know what I was thinking.

Chandler: No, I guess I just never really cried. Yâknow? Iâm not a crying kind of guy.

Joey: Come on man thereâs gotta be something that gets you choked up! Like uh, uh oh, what if you saw a three-legged puppy?

Chandler: Iâd be sad sure, but I wouldnât cry.

Joey: Okay, what if the puppy said, "Help me Chandler. All the other puppies pick on me."

Chandler: Cry?! I just found a talking puppy, Iâm rich!

Monica: Oh, Iâve got it! I have got it! (Gets up and gets something from the dresser underneath the TV.) Pictures from your childhood. This will get you going good!

(Chandler starts paging through the album.)

Phoebe: All right, whatâs going on there? (Points to a picture.)

Chandler: Oh, thatâs Parentâs Day, first grade. Thatâs me with the janitor Martin.

Monica: Where were your parents?

Chandler: Oh they didnât want to come!

Phoebe: Oh Chandler!

Monica: Poor thing!

Phoebe: So that story doesnât make you cry?

Chandler: No! Look, I donât cry! Itâs not a big deal! Okay?!

Joey: No! Itâs not okay! Itâs not okay at all!! Youâre dead inside!!

The Fan: Excuse me.

Phoebe: Yeah?

The Fan: Are you Phoebe Buffay?

Phoebe: Yeah.

The Fan: Can-can I get your autograph, Iâm your biggest fan. (Holds out a napkin and a pen.)

The Fan: Wow! Wow, thanks a lot! I just wanna say, I think youâre really talented.

Phoebe: Youâre just saying that because youâre my biggest fan. (The fan leaves and Joey approaches.) (To Joey) Joey listen, take good care of that guy, okay? (Points) Heâs a fan. (To the fan as sheâs leaving) Bye! (Exits)

Joey: (to the fan) So, you saw me on Days Of Our Lives huh? Want me to, want me to do a little Dr. Drake Remoray for ya?

The Fan: Oh yeah! Iâve seen all her movies.

Joey: Movies?

The Fan: That was Phoebe Buffay, the porn star.

Joey: (laughs) I donât think so.

The Fan: No-no, it was! She was in Sex Toy Story 2, Lawrence of Alabia, and I got her autograph! The guys at the comic book store arenât gonna believe this! (Exits.)

Joey: Hey Gunther, donât let that guy in here anymore! He just said Phoebeâs a porn star!

Gunther: Well, I wouldnât call her a star, but sheâs really good. You should check out Inspecther Gadget.

[Scene: Central Perk, time lapse, Rachel is at the counter as Jill enters.]

Jill: Hey!

Rachel: Hey!

Jill: Youâll never believe what just happened, Ross just totally blew me off and he didnât even tell me why!

Rachel: Ohhh well. Yâknow what honey? The best thing to do to get over a guy is to start dating someone else. Oh! There is this great guy you will love at work named Bob! Heâs a real up-and-comer in Human Resources.

Jill: Yâknow, thanks for trying to cheer me up, but Iâm not gonna date some random guy from your work.

Rachel: Itâs not random, itâs Bob.

Jill: Itâs probably because not mature enough. Or smart enough. Maybe he doesnât like the way I dressâNo that canât be it. Itâs really gotta be the smart thing. Oh Iâm so stupid! Iâm just like this incredibly pretty stupid girl!

Rachel: No honey, okay, okay, you wanna know why Ross canceled the date? Because I asked him to.

Jill: You asked him too?!

Rachel: Hm-mmm.

Jill: Why?!

Rachel: Because you are my sister and Ross and I have this huge historyâ¦

Jill: I donât understand, do you want to go out with Ross?

Rachel: No.

Jill: You donât want him, but you donât want me to have him?

Rachel: (changing the subject) Yâknow Bob in Human Resourcesâ¦

Jill: Ugh! I cannot believe you did this too me! You had me doubting how smart I was! (Gasps) You had me doubting my fashion sense!

Rachel: Look, this is not that big of a deal! You just donât date Ross! Thereâs a million other guys out there, you justâ¦

Jill: Hey! You have no right to tell me what to do.

Rachel: Iâm not telling you what to do! I am telling you what not to do!

Jill: Why are you so jealous of me?

Rachel: Jill this is not about me being jealous of you! This is about you being a brat! Wanting what you canât have!

Jill: Canât have?! Excuse me, the only thing I canât have is dairy! (Starts to storm out.)

Rachel: All right, all right, well you just blew your chances at dating Bob!

Jill: Who?!

Rachel: In Human Resources!!!!!!

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Rachel is ranting about Jill to Chandler and Monica.]

Rachel: â¦I am jealous of her?! I mean who does she think she is?! Princess Caroline?!

Monica: Youâre jealous of Princess Caroline?

Rachel: Do I have my own castle?

(Joey and Ross enter.)

Ross: Hey! Uh, Phoebeâs not here is she?

Rachel: No.

Monica: (noticing the bag Joeyâs carrying) Oh great! Did you get a movie?

Joey: Uhhh, yeah. Yeah. But uh, I donât think itâs the kind youâre gonna like.

Chandler: You didnât get more movies that are gonna have us reaching for the tissues all night did you?

(Joey and Ross exchange looks.)

Joey: Sort ofâ¦

Monica: Guys, whatâs going on?

Joey: (holds up the movie) Phoebeâs a porn star!

All: What?!!

(They all run over to Joey and Ross, Chandler grabs the movie and reads the title.)

Chandler: Phoebe Buffay in Buffay: The Vampire Layer.

Rachel: Oh my God!

Monica: Thatâs Phoebe! Where did you get that?

Joey: Well down at the adult video place down on Bleaker.

Ross: And-and I, and I saw that Joey was about to go in, so I ran in ahead of him to-to surprise him and, and then I pretended I didnât know he was in there. (They all kinda look at him.)

Rachel: Wow! I mean, I justâI canât, I canât believe this. Yâknow, I mean you think you know someone even, even Phoebe whoâs always been somewhat of a question mark.

Monica: This is so bizarre. I guess it kinda makes sense though, yâknow she had such a terrible childhood.

Chandler: Hey, I had a terrible childhood and I donât do porn.

Monica: Yes, but you are dead inside.

Joey: All right well, Iâd better take that back.

Monica: Wh-what, why?

Joey: We canât watch that! I mean thatâs Phoebe!

Monica: Yeah youâre right, we canâtâwe shouldnât watch this.

Rachel: Absolutely not.

Monica: (hands the tape back to Joey, but doesnât let him grab it) Yâknow maybe a little bit!

Rachel: Probably just the first half.

Joey: No! Hey no! This is wrong you guys! Phoebeâs our friend! Well, Iâm not gonna watch it!

Ross: Yeah! Good for you Joe!

Joey: Yeah.

(Ross stands next to him for a second, then goes and watches the movie.)

(The movie starts, itâs a vampireâs lair and Buffay, The Vampire Layer enters dressed in leather and carrying a wooden stake. Suddenly, the vampire opens his coffin and sits up.

Buffay, the Vampire Layer: Ah, I thought Iâd find you here, Nasforatool.

The Vampire: Buffay, are you going to plunge your stake into my dark places?

Buffay, the Vampire Layer: Actually, I was kinda hoping it would be the other way around.

(At this point, Buffay, the Vampire Layer and Nasforatool start to get it on. Of course, since this is network TV, we can only see the reactions of the gang to the film playing off screen.)

Monica: Hold on a second! What is that on her ankle?

Chandler: Her ankle is what youâre watching?

Rachel: Well itâs hard to tellâ¦ (Rachel gets up to get a closer look, only sheâs having some trouble.) Oh God, if she would just stop moving.

Chandler: Sheâs just doing her job!

Joey: (sitting at the kitchen table with his back to the TV) You sick bastards!

Rachel: Oh, itâs a tattoo! Thatâs weird, Phoebe doesnâtâ¦ Wait thatâs Ursula! Thatâs not Phoebe that is Ursula!

(Upon hearing this, Joey canât turn his chair around fast enough and knocks it over.)

Joey: Re! Re! Then I can watch that! Rewind it! Rewind it!

Phoebe: (entering) Hey! Whatâs up? (Sees the TV) Oh my God! What am I doing?!!

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler is reading Chicken Soup for the Soul as Monica enters.]

Monica: Hey sweetie!

Chandler: Hey! (He quickly tries to hide the book by throwing it under the couch, only the couch has no back and it slides into the kitchen.)

Monica: (picking up the book) Chicken Soup for the Soul?

Chandler: Thereâs no back to this couch!

Monica: Why are you reading this? You hate this kind of stuff.

Chandler: Yeah I know, but I figured a shot yâknow? Maybe one of those stories would make me cry and then you wouldnât think I was yâknow, all dead inside.

Monica: Oh thatâs so sweet! Look Chandler I donât care if you canât cry, I love you.

Chandler: Oh that makes me feel so warm in my hollow tin chest.

Monica: Stop it!

Chandler: No, I mean, come on, seriously think about it, we get married, weâre up at the altar and Iâm like this. (Makes a bored face.)

Monica: I wonât care, because I know you will be feeling it all in here. (Points to her heart.)

Chandler: Yeah?

Monica: Yeah! And if, and if we have a baby one-day, and the doctor hands it to you in the delivery room and you donât cry, so what! And-and-and, and if we take him to college and come home and see his empty room for the first time, and you got nothing, it wonât matter to me.

Chandler: Okay, well I wonât uh, worry about this anymore then.

Monica: And-and-and if I die, from a long illness. And youâre writing out my eulogy and you open a desk drawer and you find a note from me that says, "I will always be with you," and you still canât shed one tiny tear, I know youâll be crying a river inside.

Chandler: Aww, I love you soâ¦

Monica: What is wrong with you?!!!

Chandler: What?!

Monica: What?! You canât shed a tear for your dead wife!! Now, I left you a note from the beyond!

Chandler: So you didnât mean any of that?!

Monica: No you robot!!

[Scene: Ross's apartment, his doorbell is ringing and heâs running to answer it while doing up his pants.]

Ross: You damn kids! You ring my bell one more time, I swear toâ¦ (Opens the door to find Jill standing there.) Ohh, uh Jill. Umm, that-thatâs just a little game I play with the kids down the hall. Umm, theyâve really taken a liking to me. (Quickly looks out to see if theyâre watching.) Uhh whatâs-whatâs-whatâs the matter?

Jill: Rachel and I had a really big fight, can I come in? I-I mean I know weâre not supposed to see each other anymore and Iâm okay with that, itâs just that I donât know anybody in the city and I really need somebody to talk to about it.

Ross: Of course, what happened? (Lets her in.)

Jill: (entering) I donât want to talk about it.

Ross: Okay, ummâ¦

Jill: But you know what might really cheer me up?

Ross: What?

Jill: Seeing some more of your super-cool slides.

Ross: Wow! Really?!

Jill: Totally, I love them! And, maybe you could finish telling me about all the different kinds of sand.

Ross: Well, Iâd love to! Here, you wait right here and Iâll go get the projector and my notes!

Jill: Oh great! Thanks Ross, youâre such a good friend!

Ross: Ohh!

(He goes into another room to get his projector and notes. While heâs gone, Jill quickly checks her makeup.

[Cut to Monica and Chandlerâs, Rachel is entering.]

Rachel: Hey! Have you guys seen Jill? I canât find her anywhere.

Monica: No, I havenât.

Rachel: Well, is Ross home? Maybe Iâll just call him to see if heâs actually seen her.

(She goes to look out the window at Rossâs apartment and sees Jill staring at her and closing the drapes with an evil look on her face. Rachel is stunned into silence.)

[Scene: Ursulaâs apartment, Phoebe is going to confront her twin about her new porn career.]

Ursula: Who is it?

Phoebe: Itâs Phoebe! Phoebe!

(Ursula opens the door and is all dressed up with big hair and lingerie.)

Ursula: Hey!

Phoebe: (seeing her dress) Oh God. So-so youâre making porn movies.

Ursula: No Iâm not.

(Someone calls out from her apartment.)

Manâs Voice: Weâre still rolling!

Phoebe: Youâre making one right now!

Another Manâs Voice: Letâs go Phoebe!

Phoebe: And-and youâre using my name!

Ursula: Yeah, can I help you with something?

Same Manâs Voice: Phoebe, come on!

Phoebe: Look, Iâm talking right now! Youâreâyou mean her.

Ursula: Yâknow, twin stuff is always a real big seller.

Phoebe: What?!

Ursula: Yeah, I can talk them into giving you like, 30 dollars.

Phoebe: No!! No way! No! And stop using my name! And shame on you! (Yells into the apartment) And shame on all of you! Youâre disgusting! Especially you (points to someone) with that! (Storms away.)

[Scene: Ross's apartment, Ross is setting up for the slide show.]

Ross: Slides are almost ready.

Jill: Yeah. Ooh, I know what this is missing! Alcohol!

Ross: Uh okay, well thereâs-thereâs wine in the kitchen.

Jill: Oh great! (Goes to get it as the phone rings.)

Ross: (answering it) Hello?

Rachel: (on phone) What is my sister doing there?! And why are the drapes shut?!

Ross: O-okay, Rach calm-calm down, okay? She-sheâs really upset weâre just talking.

Rachel: Ross! I think she is trying to make something happen with you to get back at me!

Ross: So thatâs the only reason she could be here huh? It couldnât have anything to do with the fact that-that maybe Iâm a good listener and I uh I put on a great slide show!

Rachel: Ross, I am telling you that she is using you to get back at me!

Ross: Yâknow what? I think I can take care of myself, Iâll talk to you later. Good-bye. (Hangs up the phone and turns to find Jill sitting really close to him.) Whoa! Uh, that was your sister actually. She-she thinks that youâre just using me.

Jill: So? (Kisses him passionately.)

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is reading a paper as Phoebe enters.]

Phoebe: Hey!

Joey: Hey!

Phoebe: So, I just came from the company Ursula works for.

Joey: Oh no, not you too!

Phoebe: No! No! I just went to pick up Phoebe Buffayâs checks; there were a lot of them.

Joey: Nice!

Phoebe: Um-mmm, and I wonât have to go there anymore because I gave them my correct address.

Joey: Thatâs great, but isnât it gonna bother that people still think youâre a porn star?

Phoebe: Oh no! No! I know how to handle it.

Joey: You do?

Phoebe: Yeah. (She notices some guy putting a coat on his girlfriend is trying to remember where heâs seen her before.) (To him) Youâre trying to figure out where you know me from? All right, Iâll give you a hint. From porn! Okay? (He tries to rush his girlfriend out.) Yeah your pervert boyfriend watched me in a porno movie! (To Joey) See?

Joey: Yeah.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, time lapse, Ross is entering. Chandler and Monica are at the kitchen table. Rachel is on the couch reading.]

Chandler: Hey.

Ross: (To Rachel) You uh, you may have been right about Jill.

Rachel: Oh! I knew it! What happened?

Ross: Umm, she kissed me.

Rachel: What?! You kissed!

Chandler: (To Monica) Maybe we should give them some privacy.

Monica: (To Chandler) Shhhh!!!

Ross: Look, I uh, I tried not to kiss her, okay?

Rachel: Well, it doesnât sound like it! I mean, itâs pretty easy not to kiss someone, you just donât kiss them! See look at us, right now, not kissing!

Ross: Let me finish, okay? She started kissing me and-and I didnât stop it. I guess I-I just wasnât thinkingâ¦

Rachel: Yeah thatâs right you werenât thinking! Yâknow what? Let me give you something to think about! (She pulls up her sleeves and steps towards him.)

Ross: Oh waitâhold it! But then I started thinking and I stopped the kissing.

Rachel: Oh, well thank you for taking your tongue out of my sisterâs mouth long enough to tell me that.

Ross: Look I-I realize if anything were to happen with me and Jill then nothing could ever happen with us!

Rachel: What?!

Ross: No, I mean, look I donât know if anything is going to happen with us, again. Ever. But I donât want to know that it-it never could. So I stopped it and she got mad and broke my projector.

Rachel: Wow. I, I donât even know what to say. Thank you. (Gently kicks him.)

Ross: Youâre welcome. (Gently kicks her back.)

(Chandler starts crying.)

Monica: Oh my God! Are-are you crying?

Chandler: (crying hysterically) I just donât see why those two canât work things out!

Ending Credits

[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there as Jill enters.]

Jill: All right, Iâm leaving! Because Iâm not going to spend one more day with someone whose out to sabotage my every move. Thatâs you Rachel!

Rachel: Yeah, I got that.

Jill: (To Ross) And you! I throw myself at you and you say no, how gay are you?

Ross: You take care Jill.

Jill: (happily) Okay, see ya! (Exits.)

Rachel: Bye-bye-e!

Monica: Bye.

Chandler: (starts crying) I-I canât believe Jillâs gone. (They all look at him.) I canât help it, I opened a gate.

[Scene: Central Perk, everyone is there as Rachel enters.]

Rachel: Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce!

Monica: Oh my God!

Phoebe: Wow!

Joey: (To Ross) What is the matter with you?!

Phoebe: No! Barry and Mindy.

Joey: Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross. (To Rachel) Who-whoâs Barry and Mindy?

Rachel: Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend.

Joey: Ohh-oh, wasnât he cheating on you with her?

Rachel: Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me.

Monica: Why did they get divorced?

Rachel: Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isnât that sad? (Giggles.) God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be?

Ross: I know what you mean, Iâve always wondered how different my life would be if-if Iâd never gotten divorced.

Phoebe: Which time?

Ross: The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadnât realized she was a lesbian.

Joey: (starts to imagine it) I canât. I keep seeing it the good way.

Ross: Iâd bet Iâd still be doing my kara-tay. (Thatâs karate, heâs just saying it that way.) Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from yâknow, not doing anything else physical.

Chandler: Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay.

Monica: And what if I was still fat? (To Chandler) Well, you wouldnât be dating me, thatâs for sure.

Chandler: Sure I would!

All: (simultaneously) Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right!

Chandler: What, you guys really think that Iâm that shallow?

Ross: No, I just think Monica was that fat.

Joey: Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives! (Closes his eyes to do so.) Oh-hey, thereâs Carol again!

Chandler: What if I had had the guts to quit my job? Iâd probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my jobâs fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I donât have to wear a tie.

Phoebe: What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch?

Ross: What?!

Rachel: Merrill Lynch?

Phoebe: Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks.

Rachel: Well why didnât you take the job?

Phoebe: Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought yâknow that if Iâd work with stocks, Iâd have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox.

Ross: Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, weâd still hang out?

Opening Credits

{Transcriberâs note: This is where the opening credits are, but theyâre not the usual opening credits. Oh no! These credits are based on the world that would have been created had all of the above actually happened. It starts out with all of them at the fountain sitting on the couch as Fat Monica runs up and sits on the arm of the couch, tilting the whole thing towards her. It then goes on to show Rachelâs still a shop-aholic and with Barry. Fat Monica is sweating while cooking and dancing while eating a donut. Phoebe as the Wall Street shark smoking while on two cell phones. Then theyâre dancing in the fountain. Joey entering as Dr. Drake Remoray and meeting a groupie. Chandler trying to write as a bird does its business on his shoulder and falling asleep while typing. Ross doing some kara-tay and trying to get Carol into bed. And finally, some more dancing in the fountain, them all flexing, and the turning out the lamp and shutting off all the lights bit from the first season. Just remember one thing, this is an alternate universe. Everything from every other episode doesnât apply, for instance, Ross and Rachel have no history. And in fact have not seen each other in years in this world.}

Ross: (putting the magazine back and holding the money for it) Okay.

Rachel: But! Donât you have to give him his money back?

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey, Fat Monica, and her boyfriend are sitting on the couch. Monicaâs boyfriend is getting up to get something. For future reference, for the rest of this episode Monicaâs fat, I wonât be calling her Fat Monica throughout.]

Monica: Thanks.

Monica's Boyfriend: Yeah. Yâknow, the hazelnut actually not a nut, itâs a seed.

Monica's Boyfriend: Can anyone else name a well known seed thatâs been masquerading as a nut?

Joey: Oh dear God, let me think. (Starts to sarcastically think about it.)

Chandler: (entering, depressed) Hey.

Joey: Hey.

Monica: Oh no! Whatâs the matter?

Chandler: Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not "Archie Comic funny."

Chandler: Was his question whatâs more boring than him?

Joey: Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money?

Chandler: Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride.

Joey: Really?

Chandler: Ehh.

Monica: Maybe Joey doesnât have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right?

Joey: Thatâs an idea! (To Chandler) Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her?

Monica: No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff!

Joey: Thatâs great! That would be great! Letâs do that!

Chandler: I could use the money; it could give me time to write.

Joey: Oh right great! Welcome aboard!

Chandler: Okay!

Joey: All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I donât need any assistance in there, take a break!

Chandler: All right!

(As Joey goes to the bathroom, Corporate Phoebe enters. Sheâs wearing a business suit and carrying a briefcase.)

Phoebe: (entering) Hey!

Phoebe: Ohh thatâs so sweet! (Her cell phone rings.) Oh! Hang on! (Quickly grabs a cigarette and starts to light it as her phone rings.) Hang onnnnnn!!! (Gets the cigarette lighted and answers the phone.) (On phone.) Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, itâs a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, itâs okay. Itâs okay, youâre allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired.

Rachel: (interrupting him and seeing Joey) Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here!

Monica: Rach, heâs a friend of ours.

Rachel: (stunned) You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray?

Chandler: Well itâs kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that heâs not real.

Ross: (To Rachel) Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime!

Rachel: Heâs coming over! Heâs coming over!

Monica: (getting up) Joey!

Joey: (holding a plate of what looks like Rice Crispies Treats) I know, here-here!! (Hands her the plate.)

Rachel: (still not quite able to look at him) Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill youâ¦

Joey: Well, itâs always nice to meet the fans.

Ross: Come on Pheebs, itâs not that bad! Yâknow most people would be excited if they didnât have to work for a couple of weeks.

Phoebe: Most people donât like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and Iâm already going crazy. I miss Joan.

Monica: Honey, having a heart attack is natureâs way of telling you to slow it down.

Chandler: I always thought having a heart attack was natureâs way of telling you to die! (Phoebe glares at him.) But youâre not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but youâre not gonna die today. I wish I was dead.

Monica: Letâs take a walk. (They start to leave.) Yâknow maybe you should consider writing for Talking Out of Your Ass magazine! (They exit.)

Ross: â¦will be two monthsâ¦

Phoebe: That is.

Ross: â¦since I stopped trying.

Phoebe: Maybe you need to spice things up a little.

Ross: What-what do you mean?

Phoebe: I donât know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each otherâ¦

Ross: Oh.

Phoebe: Yâknow, dirty talk, mï¿½nage ï¿½ trois, toysâ¦

Ross: Wow!

Phoebe: Roll playingâ¦ You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench!

Ross: Okay, I think I got it.

Phoebe: Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and youâre-youâre-youâre rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybodyâs watching! (Ross looks at her.) It never happened.

[Scene: A hospital hallway, Chandler is sitting on a gurney with his hands spread out behind his back. Then Monica comes and plops down on the gurney and one of his hands. Chandler immediately recoils in extreme pain.]

Monica: Sorry. So howâs it going with Joey?

Joey: All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?

Rachel: (laughs) Wow! Umm, yâknow, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldnât.

Joey: Why? (In Drakeâs voice.) Why canât the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?

Rachel: (awestruck, then not) Isnât that a line from the show?!

Joey: Uh, yeah but uh, (In Drakeâs voice) I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now.

Joey: Thanks! (Looks at it.) Yeah, thereâs pulp in that. (Hands it back.)

Chandler: Yeah?

Joey: I thought we talked about this. I donât like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isnât juice. All juice, okay?

Chandler: Iâm sorry, I guess I just like the pulp.

Joey: Oh my God, Iâm sorry, Iâm being so rude. (Turns to Rachel.) Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it.

Rachel: Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.

Joey: (To Chandler) Iced tea.

Chandler: Okay, anything for you sir?

Carol: Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms.

Ross: Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little.

Carol: What do you mean?

Ross: Carol our sex life isâitâs just not workingâ¦

Ben: (entering) Dad!! (Runs and hugs him.)

Ross: Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why donât we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why donât you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!!

Ben: Yay! (Runs off.)

Carol: Like what?

Ross: Well I donât know umm, (Pause) what if we were too tie each other up? (Carolâs shocked and obviously doesnât like that idea.) Umm, some people eat stuff off one another. (Carol doesnât like that idea either.) Nah! Umm, yâknow we-we could try dirty talk? (Carol still says no.) Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.

Carol: (quickly) I love that idea!

Chandler: Oh you wouldnât uh, care. Itâs just a stupid comic book story.

Joey: Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang!

Chandler: Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy (Joey laughs), uh but he doesnât want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assistâas his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that canât have lumps in them.

Monica: Stop it!! Thatâs not funny!!

Joey: Well, with Dr. Drake they always tell me what to say. And with Joey, I pretty much have to make it up on my own.

Monica: No! (They both laugh.) Oyster?

Chandler: Yeah! (Takes it.) If-if-if we did do this there would be a lot of pressure on me, yâknow? Because youâve been waiting a very long time and I wouldnât want to disappoint you.

Monica: Yeah but see I have nothing to compare it too. So even if youâre horrible, how would I know?

Chandler: I do like that.

Monica: Itâs harder for me! I have those four other women to compete with!

Chandler: Well, if it helps there were only three. So it would just be for tonight, right?

Rachel: Because Iâm married. Thatâs right, I am a married woman! And I came to a TV starâs apartment to have an affair! Uck!

Joey: Thatâs ridiculous! Iâm not a "Star," just a regular famous actor.

Rachel: Yeah and Iâm a horrible, horrible person.

Joey: Rachel, would you stop saying that?! Hey-hey look, remember on the show when-when Caprice was dying and she gave meâ¦

Rachel: The ring from the cave, yeah.

Joey: Wow! Uh okay, well uhâ¦ (He gets up, opens a drawer, and pulls out the ring.)

Joey: Sure! As long as they donât find out you can keep whatever you want! And I want you to have it.

Rachel: No! No-no-noâ¦

Joey: Yes! Yes!! And every time you look at it, I want you to remember that you are a good person. Okay, youâve had the chance to cheat, and with me, but you didnât. And thatâs what this ring stands for.

Ross: Oh-oh, absolutely!

Chandler: Yeah! Totally! Totally, and you?

Monica: Great! Itâs so amazing! I mean, last time Dr. Roger came over, I was so nervous, but then after being with you Iâm all like, "Can the doctor see me now?"

Chandler: I bet he can.

Monica: Yâknow, I donât have an appointment, but I sure could use a physical. (He laughs halfheartedly) Are you sure youâre okay?

Monica: What?!

Chandler: Iâm the ruptured spleen. (Laughs.)

Chandler: Because you shouldnât be with him. (Pause.) You should be with me.

Monica: Really?

Chandler: Yeah! When you were talking about Roger, that was killing me! Look, things like last night they donât just happen. Yâknow? Or at least not to me. Or with the other two women, in the morning yâknow I was just lying there and I couldnât wait to just go hang out with my friends, but with you I always yâknow with a friend.

Monica: Chandler!

Chandler: I know you probably donât want to go out with me, yâknow because I make too many jokes and Iâve never been in a serious relationship and I guess Iâm not technically a "doctorâ¦"

Chandler: I see where youâre goinâ!

Ross: Whatâs up with the greed Joe?

Phoebe: Hey!

Ross: Hey, what have you guys been up to?

Phoebe: Ohh! We went to a self-defense class today!

Ross: Wow!

Rachel: Yeah, kicking a guy in the crotch all morning really takes it out of ya!

Joey: Takes it out of you? (Laughs.)

Phoebe: Now, we can kick anybodyâs ass!

Rachel: Yeah!

Ross: After one class? I donât think so.

Rachel: What? You wanna see me self-defend myself?! Go over there (points) and pretend youâre a sexual predator! Go on! I dare ya!!

Ross: Well, of course you can defend yourself from an attack you know is coming, thatâs not enough. Look, I studying kara-tay for a long time, and thereâs a concept you should really be familiar with. Itâs what the Japanese call (he holds two fingers up to his temple, and he does this every time he says this word) unagi.

Rachel: Isnât that a kind of sushi?

Ross: No, itâs a concept!

Ross: Yâknow what? Fine! Get attacked! I donât even care!

Phoebe: (deadpan) Come on Ross. Weâre sorry. Please tell us what it is.

Ross: Unagi is a state of total awareness. Okay? Only by achieving true unagi can you be prepared for any danger that may befall you!

Phoebe: You mean in case someone is trying to steal your bamboo sleeping mat or your kettle of fish?

(Rachel laughs and Ross mocks her.)

Ross: (moves closer) All Iâm saying is, itâs one thing being prepared for an attack against like each other; whole another story being prepared for an attack, I donât know, like a (turns and puts his face close to Rachelâs and screams) surprise!!

(Rachel calmly wipes the spittle off her face.)

Ross: All right, you know that one was coming, but that doesnât mean you have unagi. (Does the finger thing.)

Rachel: (To Phoebe) Ooh! Yâknow what? If we made reservations, we could have unagi in about a half-hour.

Rachel: Aw, I love that.

Phoebe: You guys!

Joey: You canât make crotchless panties? You take, you take a pair of scissors and you just cutâ¦

Rachel: (interrupting him) Okay-okay-okay! So, making things. That sounds like so much fun.

Chandler: I made aâ¦ (Does one of those gibberish words.)

Phoebe: What is that?

Chandler: Nothing!

Ross: So what are you gonna do?

Chandler: Well, have you guys made anything that maybe I can take credit for?

Phoebe: Ohh! I have! I have! I started making these little sock bunnies! (She takes out a sock thatâs been made into a bunny with eyes, nose, mouth, whiskers, and two other socks sown onto it for ears.) Oh for crying out loud!

Ross: Perhaps. Now Iâm curious, at what point during those girlish screams would you have begun to kick my ass?

Rachel: All right, so we werenât prepared!

Ross: Iâm sorry I had to take such drastic measures to make my point, but Iâlook, I just want you guys to be safe. (Monica comes out to throw out the garbage and Ross screamsâ¦) DANGER!!!!! (She completely ignores him and keeps walking.) Ahhh, huh? Unagi.

[Scene: Cole-Geddes Casting Agency, Joey is there on his audition and thinking about that 2,000 bucks for the twins study.]

Joey: (in his head) 2,000 bucks is a lot of money. Oh, I wish I had a twin. Where could I find someone who looks exactly like me? (The camera widens its shot to reveal a room full of Joey look-a-likes. Joey looks at the guy next to him and then back at his script.)

[Scene: Ross's apartment, Ross is coming in from doing his laundry. He starts folding it as Chandler enters.]

Chandler: Hey.

Ross: (not turning around) Chandler. I sensed it was you.

Chandler: What?!

Ross: Unagi. Iâm always aware.

Chandler: Okay, are you aware unagi (does the finger thing) is an eel?

Ross: Whatâs up?

Chandler: I canât figure out what to make Monica.

Ross: Oh, why donât you make her one of your little jokes.

Chandler: Iâm going crazy! Okay? Do you have any thing around here that looks homemade?

Ross: Yâknow what? Sheâd-sheâd love this. (Picks up a model of the Saturn V rocket, thatâs the one that took man to the moon.) Uh, itâs an exact replica of Apollo 8. I made it in the sixth grade.

Chandler: Yeah, I guess I could use that. I could say that your love sends me to the moon.

Ross: Yeah-yeah, except Apollo 8 didnât actually land on the moon. But you-you-you could write that umm, your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely. (Apollo 8 was the first one that orbited the moon and the one that read the Christmas Story from the orbit of the moon on Christmas Eve, 1968. They also took the famous Earthrise picture of the Earth rising over the moon.)

Chandler: Wait a minute, I canât give this to her.

Ross: Why not?

Chandler: Because it says "Captain Ross" on the side and "I hate Monica" on the bottom.

Ross: Oh.

(Chandler leaves dejectedly. When the door closes Rachel and Phoebe jump out from behind the curtains and screamâ¦)

Phoebe and Rachel: DANGER!!!!!

(Ross screams like a little girl.)

Rachel: Ahhhhh, salmon skin roll. (She does the finger thing.)

[Scene: Monica and Chandlerâs bedroom, heâs still trying to figure out what to make Monica.]

Chandler: Okay. Okay. (He goes to the closet, moves the clothes out of the way, and notices an empty hanger. He takes the empty hanger and bends it all out of shape. Then he holds it out as if heâs giving it to her.) Yes honey, I made it myself. (He throws it down and goes to her chest, grabs something, goes to the bed table, and takes out a pair of scissors. He turns around and holds the scissors to the crotch of the panties he just removed.) I canât do it. I canât do it. (He throws them both down and continues looking. He opens another closet door and finds a tape.) Oh! Oh! A mixed tape! A mixed tape!! (He runs out into the living room.)

[Cut to the living room, Chandler is entering as Monica finishes wrapping her present for him on the kitchen table.]

Chandler: Hey! Hi! You uh, ready to exchange gifts?

Monica: Sure! Okay, you go first.

Chandler: Okay, come here! Come here.

Monica: Okay! (She takes her present for him and they move over to sit on the couch.)

Chandler: Now, itâs not wrapped because I just, just finished it.

Monica: Okay.

Chandler: But I made you a tape of what I think are all romantic songs.

Monica: Oh, what a great gift! Is The Way You Look Tonight on it?!

Chandler: (momentarily terrified) Maybe weâll have to listen and see!

Monica: Oh, I love it! Thank you so much!

Chandler: Okay!

Monica: Okay, you ready to open yours?

Chandler: Yeah!

Monica: Okay.

(He opens his present to find Phoebeâs sock bunny from earlier.)

Chandler: Itâs a sock bunny.

Monica: Yeah-yeah, you remember how I call you bunny?

Chandler: Not really.

Monica: Well, I did one time, and-and I want to start doing it more. See thatâs what this is about.

Chandler: I see. Yâknow umm, Phoebe makes sock bunnies.

Monica: No! No, she doesnât. Uh Phoebe, what she makesâthatâs uhâtheyâre sock rabbits. They are completely differentâOkay! Okay! Okay! I didnât make it! Iâm sorry! I totally forgot about tonight and the fact that weâre supposed to make the presents!

Chandler: Oh, itâs okay. I donâtâ¦

Monica: No-no, itâs not okay! Itâs not! I mean you were justâ¦ Youâre so incredible! You went through all this time and effort to make this tape for me! Yâknow Iâm just gonnaâI, I am gonna make this up to you! I will! I-I am going to cook anything you want in here (points to the kitchen), and I am going to do anything you want in there! (Points to the bedroom.)

Chandler: (thinking it over) Well, I did put a lot of thought in the tape. (They both run into the bedroom.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica and Chandlerâs bedroom, they are relaxing in sexual bliss.]

Chandler: Wow! (To the sock bunny still on his hand.) You are way to young to have seen that!

Monica: Oops! (Covers its eyes.) Yâknow, your birthday is in a month-and-a-half, what do you say I forget to get you a present for that too?

Chandler: You are totally and completely 100% forgiven.

Monica: We have got to wash that! (Referring to the sock bunny.)

Chandler: Yeah! (Takes it off his hand and throws it behind the night-stand.)

Monica: Do you remember that jacket that you love so much, that you thought was too expensive?

Chandler: You have done enough!

Monica: I wanna wake up early and go get it for you!

Chandler: No you donâtâget it in black, not brown.

(The oven dings.)

Monica: Oop, your cake is ready!

Chandler: Oop!

(They both get out of bed and go get some cake.)

Chandler: Well, itâs like that old saying, have some sex, eat some cake.

(As they approach the kitchen, the door opens and in walks in a Joey look-a-like.)

Joey's Look-A-Like: Hey Mon! Hey Chann! (He goes to the fridge) Just gettinâ a soda! (Does so.)

Monica: Who the hell are you?!

Joey's Look-A-Like: Iâm Joey! How are you doinâ?!

Joey: Look, I got to apologize on the behalf of Carl.

Chandler: Who the hell is Carl?!

Joey: Oh, did I not mention? Carl is a guy I hired to be my identical twin for a medical research project.

Chandler: Yâknow sometimes the good ideas are just right in front of you, arenât they?

Joey: Okay, I know it sounds crazy, but I think it might work. Yâknow? The only problem is, Carlâs acting isâ¦ (Does the international hand symbol for so-so.)

Monica: The only problem!

Joey: Yeah, heâs the reason I didnât get that big Minute Maid commercial a couple of years ago remember? We were supposed to be brothers, but he messed it up.

Carl: (sticking his head back in) Hey, uh can I get a little piece of that cake?

Joey: (to Carl) Pizza!! We like Pizza!! Get out!!! (Carl does so.)

Rachel: Definitely! Phoebe, you will not find a single game show host, whoâs ass I cannot kick.

(They start to walk into the living room and notice someoneâs head sticking up from behind a chair. The camera cuts to the other side and we see itâs Ross.)

[Time lapse. The girls have Ross pinned face down. Phoebe is sitting on his back and arms while holding his head down and facing Rachel. Rachel is sitting on his knees and holding his lower legs vertically, causing Ross pain.]

Rachel: Say it!

Phoebe: Say we are unagi!

Ross: Itâs not something you are! Itâs something you have!

Rachel: Say it!

Ross: Yâknow what? I can easily get out of this, but there is a chance you can get very, very hurt!

Chandler: Look, you have done enough! Okay? You have to stop this now.

Janice: I love the way you look every night Chandler! (Monica breaks the kiss and Chandler freezes in terror.) Thatâs why I made you this tape! Happy Birthday! Love Janice!

Chandler: No! Youâre the sweetest! (He tries to kiss her but Monica backs away with a look that could kill on her face.)

Ross: Itâs a great class.

The Instructor: Thanks.

Ross: Yeah, yeah, I was watching. (The instructor just nods and walks away.) Umm, hey, a couple of questions though. Umm, about that-that-that last move where the woman tripped you and then pinned you to the floor, what-what-what-what would you do next?

The Instructor: Well, she would take her keys and try to jam themâ¦

Ross: No. No-no. No. What would you do next?

The Instructor: Who? Me the attacker?

Ross: Yes thatâs right.

Ross: I tired attacking two women, did not work.

The Instructor: What?!

Ross: No, I mean itâs okay, I mean, theyâre-theyâre my friends. In fact, I-I-I was married to one of them.

The Instructor: Let me get this straight man, you attacked your ex-wife?!

Ross: Oh, no! No-no! No, I tired! But I couldnât. Thatâs why Iâm here. Maybe we could attack them together? (He glares at him.) That-thatâs a no.

Ending Credits

[Scene: The street in front of Central Perk, Ross is walking up and sees two women that look like Phoebe and Rachel from behind.]

Ross: Ah-ha, nowhere to run! (He starts to run towards them.)

[Cut to Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are sitting up by the window because two guys have their couch.]

Rachel: I donât like sitting up here! Iâm just gonna overâ¦ (She starts to get up.)

Phoebe: (stopping her) No Rachel! They got here first!

(Ross appears at the window behind them crouched behind a garbage can and ready to spring his attack on who he thinks are Phoebe and Rachel. The camera cuts to the exterior view and Phoebe and Rachel call the shots from inside.)

Phoebe: Why is Ross doing that?

Ross: DANGER!!!!

Rachel: Oh my God! Why is he jumping on those women!

Phoebe: We should help him!

Rachel: Iâ¦ Well, I donât think they need any help.

(Ross starts to scream and run away. He stops in front of the window of Central Perk to check the pursuit and notices Phoebe and Rachel inside looking at him. He mouths, "What?" Then realizes that the women he attacked are closing in so he screams and runs away.)


[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Chandler, Rachel, and Joey are there as Ross enters.]

Ross: Hey! I just got uh, my teacher evaluations! Check out what this one student wrote, "I loved Dr. Gellerâs class. Mind blowing lectures! Dr. Geller, you are definitely the hottie of the paleontology department!"

Chandler: Ahh, Hotties of the Paleontology Department, thereâs a big selling calendar, eh?

Rachel: Who wrote it?

Ross: Oh, I wish I knew, but the evaluations are all anonymous.

Joey: Oh hey, do you still have their final exams?

Ross: Yeah.

Joey: Oh, âcause you can just match the evaluation to the exam with the same handwriting and boom, thereâs your admirer. (Ross is stunned.)

Chandler: A hot girlâs at stake and all of the sudden heâs Rain Man.

Rachel: Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute, why are we so sure that this is a girl?

Ross: Itâs a girl! Anyway, it wouâit wouldnât matter. Okay? Because Iâm a teacher and sheâs a student.

Chandler: Oh, is that against the rules?

Ross: No, but it is frowned upon.

Chandler: I see.

Ross: Besides, thereâs a big age difference.

Joey: Oh, well think of it like this, when youâre 90â¦

Ross: I know when Iâm 90 sheâll be like 80 and it wonât seem like such a big difference.

Joey: No thatâs not what I was going to say at all. No, what I was going to say is when youâre 90 youâll still have the memory of what it was like to be with a 20-year-old.

Chandler: Oh yeah, Dana Keystone. She was in my Movement class.

Ross: Oh I, I donât-I donât think that would be the best idea.

Chandler: Honey, it is not a date! I havenât talked to her in ten years! You canât just call up somebody you havenât talked to in ten years and ask them for a favor. There are rules, yâknow? You gotta, you got to put in some time.

Monica: Now, this is last minute so I want to apologize for the mess. Okay?

(They walk into a completely redecorated and repainted room. And of course, the room is immaculate. Only an obsessive-compulsive like Monica could find fault with the room.)

Rachel: Oh my God! It sure didnât look this way when I lived here.

Monica: I know! Now look, thereâs only one problem though. Thereâs only room for one, so I guess one of you will have to stay at Joeyâs.

Phoebe: Well, since the fire was kinda my fault I guess (To Rachel) you should get to stay here.

Rachel: Hey! Hey-hey, now this was no oneâs fault Pheebs. Okay? It was an accident.

Elizabeth: Who?

Ross: Oh uh, I had trouble remembering everyoneâs name, so I-I kinda came up with nicknames. Like the guy on the other side of you was Smelly von Brownshirt.

Ross: Umm, no. No.

Elizabeth: Yes you did! What was it?

Ross: Umm, itâs Cutie McPretty.

Elizabeth: Ohh thatâs so sweet!

Ross: Listen, I gotta tell ya, I-Iâm having a great time! Yâknow how before you said it might be weird, the whole student teacher thing, and to be frank I thought it would be too, but itâs not. I mean itâs not at all.

Fireman #2: Well someone does.

(Phoebe looks at Rachel.)

Rachel: Well, donât look at me! My hairâs straight! Straight! Straight! Straight!

[Cut to Joeyâs, heâs on the phone.]

Joey: (in a funny voice) Yeah, so it turns out that it wasnât the hair straightener that started the fire. (Rachel prompts him on what to say next.) No-no, it was the candles. Itâs very not good leaving candles unattended. In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school isâ¦ (Phoebe suddenly enters.) Uhhâ¦ Uhhâ¦ Okay. Well, I have to go now.

Monica: So itâs okay to date a student.

Ross: Well, not really. I mean technically itâs-itâs not against the rules or anything, but it is frowned upon. Especially by that professor we ran into last night, Judgey von Holierthanthou.

Monica: Well Ross, you be careful now. You donât want to get a reputation as yâknow Professor McNailshisstudents.

Ross: Yeah. What-what should I do?

Joey: Well Ross, it seems pretty clear. I mean whatâs more important? What people think or how you feel, huh? Ross, you gotta follow your heart.

Monica: Joey that is so sweet.

Chandler: No-noâReally?!

Dana: Of course!

Chandler: (breaking up) Well, it just hurts so bad. I uhâ¦

Dana: Ohh, Iâm sorry.

Chandler: Well maybe there is one thing you can do.

Dana: What?! Anything! Anything!

Chandler: Well, I umm, I mean this is just off the top of my head now, umm but I have this friend. This actor friend and he would kill me if he thought I was doing this umm, but umm would it be possible for him to get an audition for your movie say on Thursday?

Dana: Absolutely! But you-you would really feel better about me rejecting you if your actor friend can audition for my movie?

Chandler: Well, the heart wants what it wants. Iâll see you later. (He runs off and leaves her with the bill, which the waiter promptly delivers.)

So I think itâs better that I stay at Joeyâs.

Elizabeth: For what itâs worth I did appreciate you standing up for me. It felt really nice. It kinda made me like you even more.

Ross: I know, I know I really like you too. But we-we canât date. Itâs against the rules. Itâs forbidden.

Elizabeth: Wow!

Ross: What?

Elizabeth: Just hearing you describe it as forbidden, itâs really hot.

Ross: Really?

Elizabeth: Yeah.

Ross: Well I-I-I donât care how hot it is itâs-itâs uh, itâs wrong.

Elizabeth: Stop it! (She starts to get all worked up.)

Ross: (feeling it too) No! No! Itâs wrong! Itâs-itâs-itâs naughty. Itâs taboo.

Ross: Whatâs-whatâs the difference?

Monica: Well, spring vacation is doing nice things with your grandparents. Spring break youâre doing frat guys.

Ross: Hey, yâknow what? Not all spring breaks are like that.

Phoebe: What did you do on yours?

Ross: I went to Egypt with my dad.

Chandler: I can see it now, "Look dad, itâs the Sphinx!" (Does that party noise again.)

Ross: Hey, I think Elizabeth is a little more serious than, "Spring break!" (Imitates the party noise.) All right? I mean sheâs taken my class!

Monica: And slept with the professor.

Ross: Iâm gonna call her.

Chandler: Yeah.

(Ross leaves to do so and Rachel enters with a guy.)

Rachel: Hey! You guys umm, I want you to meet Sebastian.

Sebastian: Hi.

Rachel: We just uh, we just met at the newsstand. We both grabbed for the last Field & Stream. (Chandlerâs shocked.) What? I read that.

Sebastian: Can I get you a cup of coffee?

Rachel: Oh yes! Thank you! (He does so and Rachel sits down on the couch.)

Phoebe: Rachel, what the hell is this?!

Rachel: (shocked) What?

Phoebe: You ask us to find you a guy and you come traipsing in here with your own!

Rachel: You found me a guy?

Monica: Yes! We found you a really cute and funny guy from Chandlerâs work!

Phoebe: Yeah and I-I found you one too who is not a weirdo.

Rachel: Well, yâknow what though you guys? I really appreciate that but I think Iâm just gonna take Sebastian to the charity.

Chandler: Are you sure?! Because our guy smells incredible!

Monica: Uh, would you stop it with that already?!

(Sebastian returns with the coffee.)

Sebastian: Here you go. (Hands her, her cup.)

Rachel: Oh, thank you.

Sebastian: Sure.

Phoebe: So, Sebastian, do you do any volunteer work?

Sebastian: Uh, no not really. Why?

Phoebe: No reason, itâs just I know a single guy that cares about other people.

Chandler: Are you funny?

Sebastian: Excuse me?

Rachel: What are you guys doing?

Monica: Are you funny? Tell us a joke!

Sebastian: Look, I just wanted to have coffee with Rachel.

Phoebe: Well, so do a lot of people.

Sebastian: Actually, I uh, I gotta get going. (To Rachel) Give me a call sometime.

Rachel: Oh, but yâknow, no, you didnât give me your phone number.

Sebastian: Okay! See you later! (Exits.)

Chandler: (To Monica) Turns out he is kinda funny.

Commercial Break

[Scene: Central Perk, continued from earlier.]

Rachel: I cannot believe you guys! He was really nice and he left because of you!

Chandler: Yeah, but Sebastian? What is that? A catâs name?

Phoebe: Yeah, yâknow what I noticed Rachel? He scares easy. Is that the kind of guy youâd like to take to a ball? "Hey Sebastian, would you like to dance?" (Imitates him.) "Uhh, okayâI gotta go!"

Monica: All right guys stop it. Rachel, weâre very sorry that is a very insensitive thing for us to do. And yâknow what? Let us make it up to you, we have two really great guys for you.

Phoebe: Yeah! What have you got to lose? Yâknow you might even end up with someone really special (whispers) if you pick my guy.

Rachel: All right.

Chandler: Okay, so you will meet our guys?

Rachel: Yes, Iâll meet âem.

Chandler: Okay now it doesnât matter which one you choose, yâknow? Itâs completely up to you. Our guy is perfect, or you can go out with the guy Phoebe deemed not good enough to go out with herself.

Joey: (entering) Pheebs! There you are! Okay, you broke my fridge; you owe me 400 bucks!

Phoebe: Okay sure!

Joey: Really?!

Phoebe: Ooh, technically you owe me $600 for sending out happy thoughts on your last ten auditions.

Joey: Call it even?

Phoebe: Okay.

(Ross returns.)

Chandler: (To Ross) Well, there you are! So what did Elizabeth say?

Ross: Well, it turns out that she is going to Daytona for spring break woo-hoo. That means, that means wet T-shirt contests, guys doing shots off of girlâs bodies, waking up next to people you donât even knowâ¦

Joey: Man, she is going to have a great time! Is she staying at the Hotel Corona?

Chandler: You know the hotels?

Joey: Sure! I was there! Spring Break â81! Woo-hoo!

Monica: In 1981 you were 13!

Joey: So what? I drove down, sold T-shirts, had a blast. And yâknow who knows how to party? Drunk college chicks.

Ross: Okay, she canât go.

Phoebe: Ross, you canât tell her not to go. You just started dating.

Ross: Then what am I supposed to do?

Phoebe: Nothing, you just have to be cool with it.

Ross: Well, what is she goes down and-and sleeps with a bunch of guys?

Chandler: Well, maybe you donât marry this one.

[Scene: Elizabethâs apartment, she is packing for her trip as Ross watches.]

Ross: Iâm so glad youâre going on this trip!

Elizabeth: Yeah! Iâve been working so hard this semester. I really need to go crazy yâknow, blow off some steam.

Ross: Sure. Sure. Look I donât, I donât know if your plans are finalized yet, but umm, hey I-I know another great way to blow off steam.

Elizabeth: What?

Ross: Are you into crafts at all?

Elizabeth: Ross, are you okay?

Ross: Well, yeah, of-of course Iâm okay! What? Iâm just being supportive. Supportive of you and this whole trip, and-and (notices something) what-what is uh, whatâs this? (He holds up a rather skimpy bathing suit.)

Elizabeth: Itâs a bathing suit?

Ross: To wear in front of people?

Elizabeth: Is that supportive?

Ross: Is this?!

[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is reading as Monica and Chandler enter.]

Monica: Weâre really glad you decided to meet our guy.

Rachel: Ohâ¦

Monica: Youâre gonna like him so much. So umm, when do you want to meet him?

Rachel: I donât know. I know I donât work late tomorrow night.

Chandler: Tomorrow night is good. Tomorrow night is good, but uh, yâknow what? Why put off something till tomorrow that you can do right now? (Laughs) Eldad come here! (He stands up from the next table.)

Rachel: What?

Monica: Eldad, this is Rachel.

Eldad: How are you?

Rachel: Well-well a little blind sided but yâknow good.

Chandler: Eldad, sit down. (To Rachel) Move over! Move over now!

Rachel: IâOhh! (Moves over and lets Eldad sit on the couch.)

Chandler: There you go! There you are! (Rachel stares at Monica and Chandler)

Monica: Okay! Okay! We can take a hint! (They start to leave but run into Phoebe with her guy in tow.) (To Phoebe) What are you doing here?!

Phoebe: This is Patrick. (Points to him.)

Patrick: Hi.

Chandler: Hi. (To Phoebe) Okay, youâre too late okay? Because sheâs already with our guy.

Phoebe: (looks) Oh my God, youâre right! I am too late; theyâre sitting on the couch and talking! (To Patrick) Come on! (They go over to the couch.) Rachel?

Rachel: Yeah?

Phoebe: This is Patrick.

Rachel: Oh, hi.

Patrick: Hi.

Phoebe: Yeah, this is the guy I was telling you about.

Rachel: Yeah?

Phoebe: Yeah. And believe me, this suit does not do justice to whatâs underneath it.

Rachel: Oh-okay, but Pheebs?

Phoebe: Yeah?

Rachel: Iâm just sort of in the middle of something.

Phoebe: Oh! Okay! Yeah, thatâs okay. (To Patrick) Have a seat. (Sits Patrick down next to Rachel.)

Monica: No! You canât do that!

Eldad: Maybe I should go!

Monica: (stopping him) Sit down! Weâre winning!

Rachel: Okay, yâknow what? Maybe I should go!

All: (Chandler stops her) No-no-no-no! Have a seat! Have a seat!

Monica: Rachel! Rachel! You havenât touched Eldadâs hair!

Chandler: It is the softest hair! Touch it! (Both he and Monica do so.)

Rachel: Yeah, Iâm good.

Phoebe: Rachel? Patrick is really rich. (To Patrick) Give her some money.

Patrick: Yâknow what Phoebe? This isnât really worth the free massage.

Monica: Thatâs right Patrick, bye-bye!

Chandler: (To Rachel) Eldad is much more cooperative! And he can dance! (To Eldad) You dance for Rachel!

(He starts to get up, but Rachel stops him.)

Rachel: No-no! Donât dance for me! Please? Donât! (She gets up to yell at her âfriends.â) What is the matter with you guys?

Phoebe: Yeah, okay, letâs talk it out.

Rachel: Iâ¦ Am I the only one that this is embarrassing for?

Eldad: Iâm a little embarrassed. (Chandler shushes him.)

Rachel: Iâll tell ya who should be embarrassed! Itâs you guys! Come on! This is ridiculous! Thank you very much, but I do not need you to get me a date!

Phoebe: Then why did she ask us toâ¦

Rachel: I am still talking!! And then you chase away the one guy that I actually liked! I mean, no offense to you guys. Really! I mean (To Patrick) congratulations on all the cash, (He nods) and-and yâknowâ(Feels Eldadâs hair)âWow! You do have very soft hair! But I would much rather go to the ball all by myself than go through anymore of this! Good-bye! (Grabs her stuff, starts to leave, then turns back suddenly, and to Eldad) Now do you use some sort of special conditioner on that hair?!

Eldad: Yes, Papaya Extract.

Rachel: Thank you! (Storms out.)

Ross: So uh, have a great time down there.

Elizabeth: I will.

Ross: Yeah. And did you, did you pack that bathing suit?

Elizabeth: Yeah.

Ross: It was pretty funny when I, when I hid it for a while, huh? Anyway, umm, I-I am worried about that bathing suit, not because itâs revealing which Iâm fine with, no Iâm concerned about your health, sun exposure.

Elizabeth: Oh, donât worry I have plenty of sun block, itâs SPF-30.

Ross: Well, if whatâs in the bottle is actually 30. I mean sometimes you get 30, sometimes itâs-itâs get 4, and I swear to God more often than not itâs just milk.

Elizabeth: Ross, itâs going to be okay. Iâm not going down there to hook up with a bunch of guys. I really like you. I like how things are going between us.

Ross: Really?

Elizabeth: Yeah! Iâm just going down there to relax and hang out with my friends.

(Rachel heads for the bathroom.)

Ross: (to Paul) Just-just so you know I was a freshman and she was a senior. So it wasnât as bad as-asâ¦

Paul: Ross, look, I know Iâve been giving you a lot of jabs and itâs partly because Iâm very protective of Lizzie, and partly because well, they just keep coming to me. But I have to admit that after all the wonderful things that Lizzie has told me and the many, many, (pause) many stories that Rachel has told me that, well (pause) youâre not (pause) all bad.

Ross: Not all bad.

Paul: And anyhow, Iâm sorry I was so harsh before, but you have to understand that I (pause) still look at Lizzie like sheâs a twelve-year-old girl.

Ross: Yeah. You know what? I know what you mean; I do that too.

Paul: I beg your pardon?

Ross: No! No! NotâI donât mean I-I see her as a twelve-year-old girl! I mean I-I have a son, whoâs umm six and I still think of him as a baby.

Monica: Chandler, we said we would meet at the coffeehouse at six.

Chandler: We said seven!

Monica: We said six!

Chandler: The only way that I said six would be if the sevenâs, let meet at seven, not at six.

Monica: Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I wouldâve said something like this, "Wow! My boyfriendâs such a wise assâseven!"

Phoebe: (Turning around in the chair) Hi!

Chandler: Oh my good God.

Monica: Ugh!

Phoebe: I know what time you said.

Chandler: What?!

Monica: What time?

Phoebe: Quite an interesting turn of events, suddenly itâs my book to the rescue, huh? (Reading her book) Ooh, very interesting. Yeah, well this certainly clears things up.

Chandler: (disgusted) What does it say?!

Phoebe: I will tell you as soon as you thank me for writing my book.

Chandler: Thank you for writing your book. Its-its uh, great book and you are the queen of everything.

Phoebe: Thanks! So are you.

Wayne: Yeah. Her. All of them. Anyone.

Chandler: Yeah, Iâve been there my friend.

Wayne: Listen, I-I guarantee you keep your job if you can teach me how to talk to women like you do.

Joey: Oh wow Wayne, itâs not really something you can teach yâknow? Itâs pretty much something youâre born with if youâ(Off Chandlerâs look)âYou-you can teach it! Iâll show you right how to do it.

[Scene: A Restaurant, Rachel is still trying to talk up Ross, not to much success.]

Rachel: I mean if you think about it, I mean Ross did learn something from each marriage.

Paul: How to make the next one even shorter?

Rachel: Now wait a minute thatâs not fair. He was married to me a hell of a lot longer than he was married to Emily, he just didnât tell me. (Everyone looks at her, Ross not happily.) Maybe I have to pee again. (Gets up to try to use the bathroom.)

Paul: Well, this is fun. So Ross, did you kill any of these wives?

Ross: Yâknow what? I-I-Iâ¦ I-I have had enough of this! Yâknow, I-I-I care a great deal about your daughter and I have treated her with nothing but respect! So if-if youâve got a problem with me, franklyâ¦

Paul: Are you yelling at me?!

Ross: God no!

Elizabeth: Yâknow what daddy? If you donât like Ross, thatâs fine. It doesnât matter to me, Iâm gonna go out with him anyway.

Paul: Really?! (She nods in the affirmative.)

Ross: Well if it doesnât matter to her, it doesnât matter to me! (to Paul) Still not yelling!

Paul: Wow. What can I say? (Pause, pointing at Ross) This doesnât make me like you any better!

Ross: Thatâs okay, Iâm not so crazy about myself right now either.

Paul: Then we agree?

Ross: Uh yeah, I guessâYeah! I guess so.

Paul: Neither of us like Ross!

Elizabeth: I like Ross.

Ross: Ohhh! Kids!

Rachel: (returning) Wait-wait-wait, I just thought of another story about how nice Ross is!

Phoebe: Well itâs justâitâs one of those situations that I just hate. Yâknow? A massage client gave me three tickets to the Helmet-Pelts exhibit at the Morgan Chase museum.

Joey: (nodding knowingly) Now youâre thinking you gotta sleep with him.

Phoebe: No! No! Itâs just that he gave me three tickets and there are six of us!

Ross: Why? What?

Monica: Well, her father pays you for baby-sitting right?

Ross: No, no, thatâs funny. But maybe itâs time to move on, let it go, yâknow? Stop it! Besides, Rachel is going out with Elizabethâs father, so ah, heâs much older than she is. Looks like Iâm not the only one interested in fossils, huh?

Rachel: I mean Ross all that does is remind us that you are interested in fossils.

Ross: Okay, okay. Uh, well uh, Rachel is going to need to yell sweet nothings (Paul enters) in his ear.

Ross: Really? That okay, thatâs great.

Paul: Yeah. But then I changed my mind. Iâm funny like that. So I told Lizzie, now Iâm telling you, I donât want you seeing my daughter anymore.

Ross: All right look, I-I realize it upsets you.

Paul: Yes it does.

Ross: But, Elizabeth and I are-are both adults and so I donât think thereâs really anything you can do about it.

Paul: Iâll call the university and tell them about your relationship and have you fired.

Ross: Ohh! A man with a plan!

Chandler: No, I donât want to tell anybody else because I donât want Monica to find out.

Rachel: Good. Although yâknow, he-heâs a private guy. Yâknow, I wish I could get him to open up a little bit, share some feelings.

Phoebe: Thatâs easy! You just have to think of him as a-as a jar of pickles that wonât open.

Rachel: So what are you saying; I should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table?

Phoebe: Please, I think you know why.

Ross: I canât think of anything.

Phoebe: Come on Ross, youâre a paleontologist, dig a little deeper.

Ross: Wait a minute, is it because Joey and I didnât invite him to that Knicks game a couple of weeks ago?

Phoebe: Do you think thatâs something that heâd be mad at you for?

Ross: I guess it could.

Phoebe: Well then I think thatâs it.

Ross: Well, if heâs angry, he really shouldnât just cover it up. I-I wish he would just tell me the truth.

Rachel: Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I see the scare. Listen, Paul, I think this is really great that-that yâknow, you shared your feelings. Itâs really, itâs beautiful, but umm, what do you say we go share some food?

Paul: Oh, I couldnât eat now.

Gunther: (handing them the bill) Here you go.

Ross: Oh. (Starts to get his money)

Rachel: Whatâs the other one?

Monica: I donât know, Iâve never had to use the other one. Iâm just saying yâknow, if weâre having sex, heâs not gonna be talking.

Phoebe: Oh my God Chandler, the one you picked is gone. Itâs over!

Chandler: What?

Phoebe: Some guy bought it. Iâm sorry. I tired to stop it but they (points to the jeweler) put me in jail!

Chandler: They put you in jail?

Phoebe: The little jail between the doors!

Chandler: Phoebe, I asked you to guard the ring!

Phoebe: I know, Iâm sorry! But yâknow, this ring is better! Monica never even saw the other ring.

Rachel: I donât care about the little dude! I canât! I cannot listen to anymore of this! Yâknow, the only person who would want to listen to this is a mental health professional! And then itâs only because they get paid $100 an hour! Do you know how much money I couldâve made listening to you? $2,000! And do you know when I figured that out? While you were talking!

Paul: What?! I canât believe youâre trying to stifle me! When just 14 hours ago we figured out that that is exactly what my mother was trying to do to me!

Rachel: Ohâ¦ Iâm sorry. Iâ¦ I-I donât meanâI didnât mean to stifle you. Iâ¦ This is all just a little overwhelming.

Paul: Oh Rachel, Iâm so sorry. I didnât mean to overwhelm you. Itâs just that, when those gates open, youâ¦ (Starts to breakdown.) Hard to close âem. But they are closed now. Believe me.

Rachel: Iâm so glad, Iâm so glad you shared. (Feeling his shoulder.) And Iâm glad that youâre done. What do you say we ummâ¦ (Nods in the direction of the bedroom.)

Chandler: I canât believe I let you talk me into buying this stupid gumball machine looking ring!

Phoebe: Itâs not a stupid gumball machine looking ring! Itâs a beautiful ring!

Chandler: No, itâs not! When I looked at the other ring I could see Monicaâs face when I gave it to her, yâknow? And I could see her saying yes. When I look at this ring, all I see is a ring! Unless I look at it really closely and then I can see my own eye. (Does so and laughs.) Look, this is the most important thing Iâm gonna do in my life. I wanna make sure itâs perfect.

Phoebe: Okay. There may be a way that we can get the other ring back. âCause I heard the guy tell the jeweler where he was going to propose. So maybe we can get him to trade rings or something.

Chandler: I canât do that.

Phoebe: Well you certainly canât give her that stupid gumball ring.

[Scene: A Restaurant, Chandler and Phoebe are entering. This is the place where the guy who bought Chandlerâs ring is going to propose.]

Phoebe: There he is! (Points.)

Chandler: Okay and he hasnât proposed yet because she has no ring on her finger.

Phoebe: Wow! Youâre good! After this, we should solve crimes.

Chandler: Yeah! Okay, go, go, go get him.

Phoebe: Oh, okay. (Walks over to him.) Excuse me sir? Could you come with me please? You have a phone call.

Customer: Who is it?

Phoebe: It is your office.

Customer: Do you know who at my office?

Phoebe: John?

Customer: Oh John! Great!

(She brings him over to Chandler.)

Phoebe: (To Chandler) Here he is.

Chandler: (to him) Hi! Hi. Okay, there was a slight mix-up at the jewelry store, the ring youâre about to propose with was supposed to be held for me. So, Iâm gonna need to have that back. (The guy isnât sure.) But, in exchange Iâm willing to trade you this beautiful, more expensive ring. (Looking at the ring.) Ew.

Phoebe: Wow! I would trade.

Customer: It is beautiful, but Iâm gonna use this one. Now, if youâll excuse me.

Chandler: No-no! This is my fiancee (Phoebe) and her heart was set on that ring. You donât want to break her heart now do you?

Phoebe: Yeah, do you want to break a dying womanâs heart?

Customer: Youâre dying?!

(Phoebe coughs.)

Chandler: Yeah, sheâs dyingâ¦ Of a cough apparently.

Phoebe: Yes, and it is my dying wish to have that ring. See, if Iâm not buried with that ring then my spirit is going to wander the nether world for all eternityâ¦

Chandler: (interrupting her) Okay, thatâs enough honey!

Customer: I donât know. (Pause) Let me see the ring.

Chandler: Great! Okay, here. (Holds the ring up for him.)

Customer: (looks at it) All right. (Exchanges rings.)

Chandler: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you! (To his girlfriend) And you are about to marry a wonderful man! (She stunned and heâs horrified.) Hey! Iâm marrying a dead woman!

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Ross are watching TV as Chandler enters.]

Chandler: Guys? (They ignore him.) Iâve got something important to tell ya. (Still nothing so he walks over and stands in front of the TV.) Guys? (They lean over to try and watch the TV, Chandler mimics them.) Guys?! (Pause) Iâm gonna ask Monica to marry me.

Joey: (To Ross) I think we gotta end the freeze out.

Ross: Wait a minute, is this, is this for real?

Chandler: (goes to hug him and stops short) HeyyyyâWhat?

Joey: Oh itâs water under the bridge, forget it!

Chandler: Okay! (They hug.) I was gonna wait âtil uh, it was official yâknow? But I got so excited I just had to tell you guys because youâre my best friends.

Joey: I think Iâm gonna cry!

Monica: (laughs) Are you sure youâre okay?

Chandler: Yes! Iâm fine. In fact Iâve been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.

Mr. Thompson: I think it was valued at 19,000

Joey: (To Rachel) Hey, I was pretty close. (She just glares at him.) Uhh, so bad news. Umm, I canât buy the boat, I donât have any money.

(Mr. Thompson looks shocked and at Rachel, she suddenly starts laughing.)

Rachel: Joey! Joey, good one! (Mr. Thompson starts to laugh.)

Mr. Thompson: Thatâs good. Very good! (Walks away.)

(After heâs left, Rachel stops laughing and glares at Joey again.)

Joey: So uh listen, I think Iâm gonna take off now. (Starts to get up.)

Rachel: (stopping him) Hey! Youâ¦canâtâ¦leave Joey! You agreed to buy that boat, all right?! That is a contract! And plus if you leave, my boss is gonna kill me!

Joey: Well, what am I gonna do Rach?! I donât have that kind of money!

Rachel: I know. Okay. (Whispering and thinking.) Okay. Okay. All right. All right, this is what weâre gonna do, we are gonna go to the next highest bidder, and we are just gonna let them buy it, and then youâre just gonna pay the difference.

Joey: Okay.

Rachel: Okay.

Joey: Look, I donât know why the kids need a youth center anyway! Yâknow? They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!

Rachel: Not great.

[Scene: The Restaurant, Monica and Chandlerâs and Richard and Lisaâs tables have been pushed together and theyâre all eating and talking.]

Monica: And so, weâre hiding in the bathroom.

Richard: And-and then I sneak out and before Monica can her parents come in.

Monica: So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know theyâre going at it right on the bathroom floor.

Lisa: (laughing) Oh my God!

Chandler: I got a good one, I got a good one! I once walked in on both my parents making love to the same guy.

(An awkward silence ensues.)

Richard: Itâs so great seeing you guys again. Iâd like to make a toast. (Everyone raises their glasses) Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds itâs morning and is refreshed."

Monica: Ohh.

Chandler: What?!

(They all drink.)

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica and Chandler are returning to find Ross is there waiting for them.]

Ross: Oh my God, you guys!! (Heâs excited about what he thought happened.)

Chandler: (stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything, have we got a story for you! Guess who we bumped into at dinner!

Ross: Who?

Chandler: Richard!

Ross: What? (Excited) A-ohh! (Realizes) Ohh. Oh thatâs right thatâs right. Thatâs Richardâs favorite place too.

Chandler: Oh you knew that. Good!

Monica: I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.

Ross: Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.

Monica: Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just canât get out of!

Ross: Yâknow, maybe she is too young for me. Yâknow, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter. I finally started to see what you guys were talking about. I donât know what to do.

Monica: Why donât you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff. I mean thatâs what I did when I first (looks at Chandler and pauses) weighing stuff.

Ross: Okay umm, bad stuff. Well, Iâm-Iâm 12 years older than she is.

Monica: If the school finds out youâre fired.

Ross: Hmm.

Monica: Sheâs leaving for three months.

Chandler: For camp!

Ross: Okay, good stuff. Umm, well sheâs-sheâs sweet and pretty andâ¦

Monica: Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?" I mean like do you see yourself marrying her? (Ross pauses in consideration.) Oh my God! You did it already! You married her, didnât you?!

Ross: No! No! Iâ¦didnât do that. Itâs justâ¦ Okay, honestly no. I donât, I donât see a big future with her.

Monica: Okay well I thinkâ¦thatâs your answer.

Ross: Iâve got to talk to her. Ugh, I hate this part.

Chandler: Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth. I mean if youâre not careful you may not get married at all this year!

[Scene: The Charity Event, Rachel and Phoebe are sitting at the table as Joey approaches.]

Phoebe: Oh, okay.

Rachel: (To Phoebe) Why do you care about the guy who won the Paris trip?

Phoebe: Itâs a trip for two! (She gets up and takes off her blouse-type thingy sheâs wearing over her dress.) Excuse me. (She walks over to table four.) Excuse me, is the person who won the Paris trip at this table?

Joey: You-you have to pay that! Itâs not just a guess.

Rachel: (To Joey) Okay. Okay. (Shushes him.)

Mr. Bowmont: I was actually relieved uh I didnât win the boat. My wife wouldâve killed me.

Rachel: Ohhâ¦

Joey: Are you kidding me?! Sheâs gonna this boat!

Rachel: Y-Yeah! What-what is your wifeâs name?

Mr. Bowmont: Itâs Pam.

Rachel: Pam! Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."

Joey: Aw-awww!

Mr. Bowmont: I donât think sheâd like that.

Rachel: Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr. Bowmont."

Joey: Ooooohâ¦

Mr. Bowmont: I donât think so dear.

Rachel: Okay look, let me paint you a little picture. (She sits down next to him.) All right, you are settinâ sail up the Hudson! Youâve got the wind in your hâ(sees that heâs bald)âarms!

You canâooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when youâre old, Cappy.

Mr. Bowmont: What the hell, itâs for a good cause! All right!

Joey: No way! Itâs mine!!

Rachel: (To Joey) What?! What?!

Joey: All that stuff you just said? I want that!

Rachel: But Joey you donât have $20,000!

Joey: Who cares?! I-Iâll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr. Bowmont!!

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is taking out the garbage as Phoebe and Joey enter. Phoebe gasps.]

Joey: Oh my God, youâre back!

Phoebe: Ohh, let me see it! Let me see your hand! (Chandler is frantically trying to wave them off.)

Monica: Why do you want to see my hand?

Phoebe: I wanna see whatâs in your hand. I wanna see the trash.

Joey: Yeah.

(Chandler puts his face in his hands as Joey and Phoebe start to examine the trash.)

Phoebe: Eww! Oh, itâs all dirty. You should throw this out.

Monica: (suspiciously) Okay. (Exits to carry out Phoebeâs wishes.)

Chandler: (after the door closes) What did you guys just do?!

Phoebe: What happened?

Chandler: Richard was there so I couldnât do it!

Joey: What?! Nooooâ¦ (Phoebe gasps.)

Chandler: Iâm gonna do it tomorrow yâknow, and-and surprise her, but now youâve ruined it!

Joey: We didnât ruin it!

Chandler: Who walks into a room and asks to see a personâs hands?!

Phoebe: Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctorâ¦

Joey: Glove salesman!

Phoebe: Good one! Yeah.

Chandler: This is terrible. What am I going to do?

Phoebe: Look, she only suspects something okay? She doesnât know for sure, so just throw her off the track.

Chandler: Thatâs right, I can throw her off. I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.

Phoebe: Yeah! Yeah! Convince her that-that youâre scared of commitment! Convince her that youâre a little coward!

Chandler: I can do that, Iâve had 30 years of practice.

Joey: Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off! (They give each other fives.)

Monica: (entering) I had to go all the way to the basement because some idiot keeps stuffing the trash chute with pizza boxes!

Joey: That guyâs still doing that?!

Rachel: (entering) Hey! (Sees Monica, gasps, and runs over to her.) Oh my God youâre here, let me see your hand!!

Phoebe: No, youâre too late!!! She already took out the trash!!!

[Scene: Outside of Elizabethâs dormitory, Ross is exiting after breaking up with her and we can hear his thoughts.]

Ross: (in his head) Wow! I have never had such a healthy break-up! She was such a grown-up about it! She didnât seem too immature for me! Did I just make a huge mistake?

Elizabeth: (sticking her head out her window) Ross! Wait!

Ross: Elizabeth, thank God! I was just thinking aboutâ¦

Elizabeth: You suck!!

Ross: What?!

(She throws a water balloon at him and hits him on the head and hits him again at the waist with another one.)

Ross: Okay, break-upâs still on!

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is looking out the window and Joey is sitting on the couch.]

Chandler: Okay, okay, here she comes! (Sits on the couch next to him.) How do I look? Do I look like a guy who doesnât want to get married?

Joey: Yeah! And also, a little like a French guy. (They both squint at each other.) I never noticed that before.

Monica: (entering) Hi guys!

Joey: Hey!

Chandler: Hey!

Monica: What are you up too?

Chandler: Oh, just hanging out, talkinâ about uh, websites. (Joey laughs.) Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.

Joey: (laughs) Yeah, Big Brother.

Monica: Well thatâs a little crazy. Although I am yâknow glad to hear that youâre branching out on what you look at on the Internet.

Chandler: Yeah, wellâ¦ Yâknow, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?

Monica: Why?! To celebrate your relationship! To solidify your commitment! To declare your love for one another to the world!

Chandler: Ehâ¦

Monica: Okay well thatâs good to know.

(We hear the backup horn of a truck and see through the window that the Mr. Bowmont has arrived.)

Waitress: (to the customer) Come on in.

(The customer turns out to beâ¦)

Richard: Hi!

Monica: Richard!

Richard: Actually, Iâm not here to complement the chef.

Monica: Ohhâ¦ Oh, thatâs okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do! So whatâs up?

Richard: Well, it was great seeing you the other night.

Monica: Oh, good to see you too. Did you come down here to tell me that?

Richard: No! I came here to tell you something else. (Pause) I came here (Pause) to tell you I still love you.

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monicaâs Restaurant, continued from earlier.]

Monica: What uhâWhat did youâWhat?!

Richard: I still love you. And I know I probably shouldnât even be here telling you this, I mean youâre with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say heâs straight Iâll believe you! After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didnât tell ya Iâd regret it for the rest of my life. Letting you go was the stupidest thing I ever did.

Monica: Yâknow youâre really not supposed to be back here!

Richard: Well yeah, Iâm sorry. I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya! I wanna spend my life with you. I wanna marry you. I wanna have kids with you.

Monica: Oh Godâ¦ (Starts looking around.) Why donât they put chairs back here?!

Richard: I know this is crazy but am I too late?

Monica: What theâ¦ Yes youâre too late! Where was all this three years ago?!

Richard: Well I know I was an idiot! And I tried to forget you, I really did! Yâknow after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!

Monica: What were you doing in Africa?

Richard: Working with blind kids.

Monica: Ohhh! What are you doing to me?! Oh look, I-Iâ¦ Iâm sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.

Richard: Okay thatâs fine, Iâll walk away. And Iâll never bother you again, but only if you tell me Chandlerâs willing to give you everything I am.

Monica: Well he is! Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about! My goodness, in fact, Iâm the one thatâs making him wait!

Richard: You are?

Monica: Yeah!

Richard: Why?

Monica: Why? Because of the government.

[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is bringing Phoebe some coffee.]

Rachel: Isnât it incredible?! Monica and Chandler, gettinâ married.

Phoebe: I know, theyâre gonna be so happy together.

Rachel: Ohhâ¦ I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?

Phoebe: Not that often!

Rachel: No! Iâm so happy for them!

Phoebe: Me too! So happy for them!

Rachel: Iâm so happy and not at all jealous.

Phoebe: Oh no! No God, definitely not jealous!

(They both take a drink of coffee.)

Rachel: I mean Iâm probably 98% happy, maybe 2% jealous. And I mean whatâs 2%? Thatâs nothing.

Phoebe: Totally. Iâm like 90/10.

Rachel: Yeah me too.

(Joey enters looking like Captain Stubing from the Love Boat.)

Joey: Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?

Rachel: (staring at him) Whâno, but yâknow who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.

[Scene: A Pizza Joint, Chandler and Monica are eating lunch.]

Monica: So that marriage stuff that you were saying yesterday, you donât really believe that do you?

Chandler: Sure I do. In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural. I mean look at pigs. Letâs take a second here and look at pigs. Okay pigs donât mate for life. I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and thatâs just an ordinary pig not even a pig thatâs good at sports!

Monica: Yeah, but thatâs pigs not people!

Chandler: If marriage worked, Iâd be all for it. But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is? 97%.

Monica: Wait a minute. Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?

Chandler: Well, never say never but yâknow probably uh yeah, never.

Monica: Oh my God! Then-then-then what are we even doing?! What is this?!

Chandler: Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What is all this pressure?! Is this some new kind of strategy? Why donât you put down your copy of âThe Rulesâ huh mantrap?!

Monica: Yâknow what?! I gotta go! Ugh!

(She gets up and storms out. The people at the other tables are staring at Chandler.)

Chandler: (to them) Itâs okay, I got a plan.

[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are still talking.]

Rachel: Weâre gonna find love!

Phoebe: Definitely!

Rachel: Yeah, Iâm pretty confident about that. Thatâs what makes it so easy for me to be 80% happy for Monica and Chandler! It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.

Phoebe: What do you mean?

Rachel: Well yâknow, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time theyâre 40, they marry each other.

Phoebe: You mean a backup?

Rachel: Exactly!

Phoebe: Yeah, yeah I got that.

Rachel: You do?

Phoebe: Hm-mmm.

Rachel: Who?

Phoebe: Joey.

Rachel: Joey?!

Phoebe: Yeah!

Rachel: Are you serious?!

Phoebe: Yeah, I locked him years ago!

Rachel: Whâ¦ Soâ¦ If neither of you are married by the time youâre 40, youâre gonna marry Joey.

Phoebe: Yep, we shook on it. Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.

Rachel: Oh, seriously?

Phoebe: Ohh, yeah. I think his exact words wereâ¦ (She makes two clicking sounds with her tongue and purrs.)

Rachel: Charming.

Phoebe: Well hey, itâs just a backup.

Rachel: Yeah.

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey, still looking like Captain Stubing, is practicing his slipknots as Monica enters.]

Joey: Hey Monica!

Monica: Have you seen Rachel? Or a mirror?

Joey: This is for my boat, pretty cool huh?

Monica: Yeah, itâs great.

Joey: Whoa-whoa, whatâs the matter?! Talk to the captain!

Monica: Iâm just having one of those days where you realize youâre in a dead-end relationship!

Joey: Chandler giving you a hard time huh?

Monica: Itâs not like I want to get married tomorrow! Itâs just that I-Iâd like to believe that Iâm in a relationship thatâs actually going somewhere, that Iâm not just wasting my time!

Joey: Well, you know Chandler.

Monica: No I donât know Chandler! Not anymore! Itâs like itâs like somethingâs changed.

Joey: Maybe you changed?

Monica: I didnât change!

Joey: Maybe thatâs the problem.

Monica: What?!

Joey: Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.

Monica: Is that some kind of boat talk?

Joey: I donât know! (All excited) I havenât totally decided how to talk on my boat yet.

Monica: What does he think? Does he think Iâm just gonna wait around for nothing?

Joey: Monica face it, Chandler is against marriage. And-and always will be!

Monica: (starts for the door) Well thereâs some people who do want to marry me.

Joey: There are?

Monica: Yeah! Richard!

Joey: R-R-Richard said he wants to marry you?! (Monica nods yes.) And-and Chandlerâs tellinâ ya how much he hates marriage?!

Monica: Thatâs right.

Joey: Chandler loves marriage!!

Monica: You just told me that he hates marriage! That-that heâs a-a complex fellow whoâs unlikely to take a wife! That-that heâs against marriage and always will be!

Joey: You got that from what I said?!

[Scene: Ross's apartment, Ross is watching a show about the extinction of the dinosaurs.]

Narrator: When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.

Ross: What happened you guys?

(Thereâs a knock on the door, he shuts the TV off, and answers it.)

Ross: Rach!

Rachel: Hey you!

Ross: Hey, come on in.

Rachel: Oh thank you. Hey yâknow, Iâm so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.

Ross: Oh, thanks. Yeah, I really thought weâd be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasnât meant to be.

Rachel: Yeah, love. Itâs a tricky business isnât it?

Ross: I guess so.

Rachel: So what do you say we make a pact? If you and I are both single by the time weâre 40, we get married. I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and weâve-weâve already slept together so yâknow thereâll be no surprises there! You know what I mean? No like, "Whatâs that?!"

Ross: Right. Ohh! You-you want me to be your backup.

Rachel: Exactly.

Ross: Ohh, yeah I already have one.

Rachel: What? Who?

Ross: Phoebe.

Rachel: Phoebe?! Wait aâbut-but she just, she said that Joey was her backup.

Ross: Ohh, I donât think so.

Rachel: Ross! I just had a conversation with her, and she said that she and Joey made a deal!

Ross: Thatâs impossible! I mean we have had a deal for years! We-we-we shook on it, although believe me she wanted to do a lot more than that.

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is entering to find Joey, still looking like Captain Stubing, on the phone.]

Joey: Where the hell have you been?!

Chandler: I was making a coconut phone with the professor.

Joey: Richard told Monica he wants to marry her!

Chandler: What?!

Joey: Yeah! Yeah, Iâve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these (lifts a leg) damn boat shoes wouldnât keep flying off!

Chandler: MyâOh my God!

Joey: I know! They suck!!

Chandler: Heâs not supposed to ask my girlfriend to marry him! Iâm supposed to do that!

Joey: I know!

Chandler: Well whatâ¦ Yâknow what Iâm gonna do? Iâm gonna go over there; Iâm gonna kick his ass! (Pause) Will you help me?!

Joey: Look, Chandler I donât think us getting our asses kicked is a solution. Okay? Just go and find Monica!

Chandler: Youâre right.

Joey: Yeah!

Chandler: Okay. (Starts running for the bedroom) Iâm gonna get the ring! Iâm gonna get the ring! (Does so) Iâm gonna go find her and (starts running for the door) Iâm just going to propose!

Richard: Uh, no! No! Thatâsâ¦art! If it bothers you I can put my art out.

Monica: No thatâs, thatâs okay.

Richard: So Monica let me ask you a question. Yâknow, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?

Monica: Uh yeah, I-I actually I thought about you a couple months ago.

Richard: Oh really?

Monica: Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I donât like my new eye doctor.

Richard: Who is it?

Monica: Edward Nevski?

Richard: Yeah heâs no good. Do you ever (pause) think about me in a (pause) non-eye doctor way?

[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is reading as Rachel enters.]

Rachel: Phoebe! You picked Joey and Ross?! You can not have two backups!

Rachel: What?!

Joey: (entering) Hey!

Ross: (entering) Hey!

Joey: Phoebe! Weâre both (points at Ross and himself) your backup?!

Phoebe: I donâtâLook I donât know what youâre complaining about now? You were both aware of the situation!

(At the same time.)

Joey: No we werenât!

Joey: Pick me!!

Ross: No! Pick me! I donât want to end up an old maid!

Phoebe: All right well letâs see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boatâThis is hard!

Joey: This is crazy! Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!

Ross: Ooh, I wanna switch to Rachel too!

(Rachel gets all happy.)

Phoebe: No wait! JustâOkayâJust wait! You guys! Wait you guys! Donât make any rash decisions, okay? Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.

Rachel: Oh God, Phoebe!

Phoebe: (To Rachel) Iâm talking about massages.

Rachel: Oh.

(She turns her head away and when sheâs not looking, Phoebe shakes her head and mouths, "No, Iâm not." Both Joey and Ross smile, look at each other, and then stop smiling.)

Rachel: Okay, yâknow what?! I know-I know how to settle this! All right here, this is what weâre gonna do! Iâm gonna write Joey on one napkin (does so) and Iâm gonna right Ross on the other napkin (does so) and we are going to pick one! And that person is going to be our backup! Okay?

Joey: Okay thatâs fair.

Ross: All right.

Phoebe: Good!

(Rachel mixes them up in her hands, moves them all around, and puts her hands behind her back.)

Rachel: Pick one.

Phoebe: Left! (Rachel hands her the napkin in her left hand and they both unfold and read them.) Thank you.

Rachel: Youâre welcome.

Phoebe: (reading) Ross!

Rachel: (reading) Joey! (Pause) We should just switch.

Phoebe: Yeah absolutely! (They both switch.)

Joey: Yeah.

[Scene: Richardâs Apartment, Monica is looking around and notices an African mask hanging on the wall.]

Monica: (to the mask) I missed you-you ugly, flat faced old freak!

Richard: Excuse me?

Monica: Oh! (Laughs and points at the mask.) Him.

Richard: Oh. (Laughs.) Whew!

Monica: I missed this apartment! Now, this is a grown-upâs apartment! Yâknow, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!

Richard: Yeah! Youâre saying, you need to be with someone more mature. Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine. Or a mustache.

Monica: Yâknow, letâs face it, Iâm not a kid anymore! I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do! I mean coming to my place of work and telling me that you love me, I want that! Talking about pig sex over lunch, I donât want that!

Richard: I think thatâs fair.

Monica: Fair? Please donât even talk to me about fair! Fair wouldâve been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair wouldâve been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!

Richard: Itâs okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. (Hugs her) Shhhh.

Monica: Nothing. (She backs away a little bit but is still in his arms and looks up at his eyes.) I donât knâUmm. I donât know. Ummâ¦

Richard: I know. (Backs away.)

Monica: Yâknow, I-Iâ¦ I have to figureâ¦some stâYâknow, some stuff before I canâ¦

Richard: Yeah, I understand. Take as much time as you want. (Pause) Ten, even twenty minutes if you need it. Iâll be here. Not smoking. (Monica leaves.)

[Scene: Richardâs Apartment, time lapse. Richard is smoking as he hears a knock on the door. He quickly puts out his cigar and opens the door.]

Richard: Chandler.

Chandler: Where is she? Iâm not scared of you! (Averts his eyes and walks in.)

Richard: Sheâs not here and please come in.

Chandler: (examining the coffee table) Scotch on the rocks, with a twist, on a coaster? Ha-ha, Monica! Monica!

Richard: Okay, she was here, but she left.

Chandler: Well where did she go?

Richard: Well she said she had to think things over.

Chandler: Oh my God, I canât believe this! Yâknow, I thoughtâ¦I thought you were a good guy.

Richard: Oh, hey look nothing happened.

Chandler: Nothing happened? Nothing? So you didnât tell my girlfriend that you love her?

Richard: Well all right, one thing happened?

Chandler: Yâknow what? I canât believe this! Do you know what you did? My girlfriend is out there thinking things over! You made my girlfriend think!!

Richard: Well Iâm sorry.

Chandler: And what does she have to think about? I love her!

Richard: Well, apparently Iâm willing to offer her things that you are not.

Chandler: But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, yâknow? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, sheâd be surprised!

Richard: Well if it helps, it worked very well.

Chandler: It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isnât fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other! And this is all just been one stupid mistake! (Sits down heavily.) I was gonna propose tonight.

Richard: You were gonna propose? (Sits on the arm of the couch.)

Chandler: Yeah I even (pause) got a ring. (Puts in on the center cushion.) Did you get a ring?

Richard: No I donât have a ring! (Pause) You go get her Chandler. (Pause) And can I give you a piece of advice? If you do get her, donât let her go. Trust me.

Chandler: Yâknow Richardâ¦you are a good guy.

Richard: I know. (Pause) I hate that!

(Chandler gets up and runs out, but as soon as the door closes behind him he opens it, runs back in, picks up his ring Richard is holding up for him, and runs back out.)

[Scene: The Hallway, Chandler is running up the stairs and towards his apartment, but Joey is taking out the garbage at the same time and stops him in the hall.]

Joey: Dude!

Chandler: I canât talk to you now, I gotta find Monica!

Joey: Sheâs gone.

Chandler: What?

Joey: Sheâs gone. She had a bag and she left.

Chandler: What are you talking about?

Joey: She was all crying. She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.

Chandler: Well why didnât you stop her?! Why didnât you just tell her it was a plan?!

Joey: I-I did! I told her everything, Chandler! But she wouldnât believe me.

Chandler: Well whereâ¦ Where did she go?

Joey: To her parentâs I think and she said you shouldnât call her. But if I were you I would.

Chandler: I canât believe I ruined this.

Joey: I am so sorry man.

(He walks dejectedly into his apartment to find it lit with about a thousand candles and Monica standing in the living room.)

Monica: You wanted it to be a surprise.

(He turns to look at Joey who smiles slyly and closes the door leaving them alone.)

Chandler: Oh my God.

(Monica gets down on one knee.)

Monica: Chandlerâ¦ In all my lifeâ¦ I never thought I would be so lucky. (Starting to cry.) As toâ¦fall in love with my bestâ¦my bestâ¦ Thereâs a reason why girls donât do this!

Chandler: Okay! (He joins her on one knee) Okay! Okay! Oh God, I thoughtâ¦ (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this. (Pause) I thought that it mattered what I said or where I said it. Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be. (Starting to cry again.) And if youâll let me, I will spend the rest of my life trying to make you feel the same way. (Pause as he gets out the ring.) Monica, will you marry me?

Monica: Yes.

(The crowd goes wild as he puts the ring on her finger. They hug and kiss this time as an engaged couple.)

Monica: I knew you were likely to take a wife!

(They hug again.)

Joey: (yelling through the door) Can we come it yet?! Weâre dying out here!

Monica: Come in! Come in! (Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe burst through the door.) Weâre engaged!!!

(Everyone screams and has a group hug.)

Rachel: Ohhh, this is the least jealous Iâve ever been!

Phoebe: Oh no wait no, this is wrong! Ross isnât here!

Monica: Ohâ¦

Rachel: Oh hell, heâs done this three times! He knows what its about!

Joey: Yeah!

(They all hug again.)
