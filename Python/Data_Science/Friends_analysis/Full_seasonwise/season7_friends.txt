Rachel: Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt sheâs even had time toâ¦

Phoebe: Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?

Rachel: (To Monica) Yeah, youâre on your own.

Monica: Yâknow what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.

(They all agree and start to go and get ready.)

Joey: But I-I-I canât stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. Iâm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. (Everyone stops in their tracks upon hearing this.) What?

Chandler: So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?

Joey: You guys donât think I look 19?

(A brief silence ensues.)

Phoebe: Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!

[Scene: Monica and Chandlerâs bedroom, theyâre getting ready.]

Monica: (looking at her hand) Yâknow what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! (Sees Chandler sitting on the bed.) Youâre not getting dressed. (Chandler quietly folds over the comforter on the bed making a spot for her.)

Chandler: Know what I mean?

Monica: Yeah, but I donât think we have time.

Chandler: Thereâs gonna be a wedding. Youâre gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.

Monica: (chasing after him) Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, donât worry about it!

Chandler: (motioning with his hands) Iâm not worried, Iâm uh, Iâm fascinated. Yâknow itâs like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. (Exits as Phoebe enters from her room with her guitar.)

Phoebe: Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. (Singing)

"First time I met Chandler, I thought he was gay.
But here I am singing on his wedding day!"

Monica: Phoebe!

Phoebe: If you wouldâve let me finish, it goes on to say that heâs probably not gay.

Rachel: Ohhâ¦

Ross: You okay?

Rachel: Yeah, I guess. I-Iâ¦ I mean, do-do you think weâre ever gonna have that?

Ross: You mean, weâyou and me?

Rachel: Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.

Ross: Oh good, you scared me for a minute.

Rachel: Shake it off.

Ross: I meanâno, itâs just âcause, itâs just âcause you and I were like a nightmare. (Screams.) No, but there was some good times.

Rachel: No, absolutely. Yâknow like it was ummâ¦

Ross: Surely you can think of something good.

Rachel: Yeah, just give me a minute! (Thinking) Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.

Ross: What?

Rachel: Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.

Ross: Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?

Rachel: Yeah.

Ross: Yeah?

Rachel: Uh-huh.

Ross: (to his hands) Way to go guys. Yâknow, you-you were really good at the stuff too.

Rachel: Oh, I know. Hey, yâknow what we never did? (Ross looks at her.) Oh no, not that. (Ross nods okay.) We uh, we never had bonus night!

Ross: A what?

Rachel: Yâknow, bonus night. Yâknow, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.

Ross: One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?

Rachel: Yeah-yeah, we never had that,

Ross: No.

[Silence.]

Ross: Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, Iâm-Iâm sure it would be amazing but Iâ¦gotta say I really-really donât think it would be a good idea. Yâknow? I really, reallyâ¦donât.

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Chandler is playing Playstation, Crash Team Racing to be exact (heâs in last on Hot Air Skyway to be more exact) as Joey enters from his room desperately trying to look like a 19-year-old. Heâs got the wool cap, heâs got the cut-off Knicks jersey over the faded T-shirt, and heâs got the whole pants-around-the-knees-showing-off-the-boxers thing that rich, white, suburban kids have adopted in a desperate and extremely futile attempt to try to look like theyâre from the inner-city.]

Joey: âSup? âSup dude?

Chandler: (putting his hands up) Take whatever you want, just please donât hurt me.

Joey: So youâre playing a little Playstation, huh? Thatâs whack! Playstation is whack! âSup with the whack Playstation, âsup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!

Chandler: Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.

Joey: Come on man, really how old?!

Chandler: Young! Youâre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodyâs ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!

Joey: Wow thanks! (He goes into his bedroom and closes the door.)

Chandler: Joe?

Joey: Yeah!

Chandler: Uhh, youâve had a lot of sex right?

Joey: When? Today? Some, not a lot.

Chandler: Well, itâs just the reason that Iâm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toâI mean I really wanted too, but I couldnâtâ¦. There huhâhmm, there-there was an incident.

Joey: Donât worry about that man, that happens.

Chandler: Itâs happened to you?

Joey: Yeah! Once.

Chandler: Well, whatâd you do?

Joey: I did it anyway.

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is in the living room and Phoebe is in her room.]

Monica: Phoebe! Come on! Letâs go! (Knocks on her door.) Come on! (Phoebe enters with guitar and not ready to go.) Why arenât you dressed yet?!

Phoebe: Iâm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out. (Gets ready to play.)

Monica: (grabs the guitar away from her) No, Phoebe, Iâll tell you what, if you get ready now Iâll let you play it at the wedding.

Phoebe: Really?! Oh thatâs so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again Iâll have to pound on you for a little bit.

Monica: Fair enough, now go get ready!

Phoebe: Okay. (She goes to get ready.)

Monica: Iâll get everybody else (Does so), finally we can start celebrating myâ(She gasps and is stopped by the sight of Ross and Rachel making out in the hall.) Iâm sorry, uh apparently Iâve opened the door to the past.

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, continued from before the commercial break. Monica is walking into the apartment followed by Ross and Rachel.]

Ross: Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just sawâ¦

Monica: (interrupting) Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?

Rachel: What?

Monica: See, Iâve been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people Iâm only planning on doing this once. So, uh yâknow, maybe this is selfish and Iâm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.

Rachel: Oh honey, but it is just aboutâ¦

Ross: It is! It is!

Monica: No itâs not! No! No! Now itâs about you and Ross getting back together!

Rachel: What?!

Monica: See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!

Ross: Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!

Rachel: Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!

Ross: Yeah!

Monica: Thatâs true.

Rachel: Honey I swear it we just kissed.

Ross: It was just a kiss. (Phoebe enters and overhears this.)

Phoebe: You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?

Monica: Thunder being stolen!!

Rachel: Okay come on Phoebe, itâs nothing! Monica, come on!

Ross: Look letâs not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesnât even matter!

(Chandler and Joey enter and overhear that.)

Joey: Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!

Chandler: (angrily) I donât think thatâs what they were talking about Joe!!

Phoebe: What a great night, Chandler canât do it, these guys kissedâ¦ (Points to Ross and Rachel.)

Joey: What?

Chandler: What?!

Joey: You guys kissed! Oh myâthis is huge!

Rachel: No!

Ross: Oh no!

Rachel: No-no, itâs really not huge.

Ross: And; people thinking itâs huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. (To Monica) Which we are not!

Monica: Well, weâre still talking about it, arenât we?

Phoebe: Well yeah, that and Chandlerâs problem.

Joey: Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.

Monica: Yes that would be lovely.

Joey: You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!

Chandler: Yes, you can pass for 19.

Joey: Really?

Chandler: Yes!

Joey: Seriously?

Chandler: Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!

Joey: (gasps) Iâm 30!

Rachel: Joey, you are not! Youâre 31.

Joey: (realizes) Aww crap!

Phoebe: Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, weâll get us some Mai Thaiâs, (To Chandler) maybe no more for you though.

Monica: Yâknow what? I-I think that umm, I donât feel like going to The Plaza.

Phoebe: Why?!

Rachel: Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Lookâ¦

Monica: No-no, I-I really donât want to talk about it! I donât! (To Rachel) Especially with you. (Goes into her room.)

Joey: Psss, that is whack!

[Time lapse, Phoebe is playing the guitar for Joey.]

Phoebe: (sheâs strumming something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Okay, I think Iâll play it at the wedding.

Joey: Yeah! Well, I think weâll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you donât."

Phoebe: Well, I donât think Monica is gonna take this away.

Joey: Wouldnât she?

Phoebe: Would she?

Joey: Would she? (He smells something and gasps as he realizes what it is.) You ate my candy bar!

[Scene: Rachelâs bedroom, sheâs pacing as Ross knocks on her door and opens it a little to stick his hands in.]

Ross: Guess who? (Enters fully.)

Rachel: Hey.

Ross: Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the airâ¦

Rachel: What do you think Monica mean when she said she didnât want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.

Ross: Still thinking about it huh?

Rachel: Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? (Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!

Ross: (loosening his tie) Oh, who cares?

Rachel: I care!

Ross: (tightening his tie) And so do I.

Rachel: Yâknow what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?

Ross: Okay. Sure. (Sits down on her bed.)

Rachel: Am I going to let you watch me undress?

Ross: (sitting up) No! (Exits.)

[Scene: Monica and Chandlerâs bedroom, they are both getting undressed.]

Monica: I canât believe her, yâknow itâs justâitâs so typical.

Chandler: Now Monica, I know youâre upset, but donât forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then thereâs going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.

Monica: Paris?

Chandler: We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).

Monica: Keep talking.

Chandler: Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because itâs romantic, but because I can!

Monica: I love you!

(They start making out and both start to feel something growing below the belt line.)

Monica: (in a French accent) Bonjour, monsieur.

Chandler: Okay, donât say anything, you might scare it away.

(There is a knock on the door.)

Chandler: Itâs Paris, who knows weâre here!

Monica: (opening the door) Hi Pheebs, whatâs up? (She enters.)

Phoebe: Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, Iâm just gonna need a small deposit.

Monica: What?!

Phoebe: Yâknow, just some good faith money to hold the date.

Chandler: Pheebs, weâre not giving you a deposit for our wedding!

Phoebe: Oh, I see. (Exits angrily.)

[Cut to the living room, Joey is eating a sandwich.)

Joey: They break your heart, donât they?

Phoebe: Yâknow, I donât really their permission.

Joey: Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!

Phoebe: Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then youâ¦ You gotta do something about your eyes.

Joey: What?! Whatâs wrong with my eyes.

Phoebe: They give you away! Thereâs just-thereâs just too much wisdom in there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.

Joey: And thatâll get rid of my wisdom?

Phoebe: Maybe just 10 minutes for you.

[Cut back to Monica and Chandlerâs room, they are making out again as thereâs another knock on the door.]

Chandler: Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I donât care!

(Monica opens the door to Ross and Rachel.)

Monica: Yes.

Rachel: Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didnât want to talk to anyone, especially me?

Chandler: What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!

Rachel: No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?

Monica: Well, letâs just say itâs not the first time youâve stolen my thunder.

Rachel: What?!

Ross: (To Rachel) Hey, hereâs a thought.

(Rachel ignores him and follows Monica into the kitchen.)

Rachel: Monica, what are you talking about?

Monica: My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.

Chandler: (entering) Ahh, third base.

Monica: Itâs all everybody at the party could talk about!

Rachel: Monica, yâknow what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!

Monica: (gasps) We had a characturist!

Rachel: Oh!!

Phoebe: (singing, angrily)

"Whenever I get married, guess who wonât get to sing?
Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!"

(Exits.)

Rachel: Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.

Monica: And yet, here we are doing it again.

Rachel: Ugh, Monica I donât want to steal your stupid thunder!

Monica: Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!

Ross: Got me. (He shows of his hands.)

Rachel: All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ainât gonna happen!

Monica: I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!

Rachel: I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!

Monica: Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!

Ross: Uh, Rachel, Iâve been thinking. I donât think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. Iâm calling it off.

Chandler: (To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.

Rachel: (ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?

Monica: I donât know! I donâtâmaybe youâre feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought youâd get married first! Maybe you canât stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!

Rachel: Oh wow. Thatâyâknow what? That is so unfair. Yâknow what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, letâs go have sex!

(Ross tries to dismiss it by making that sound, but decides to go for it and follows Rachel.)

Monica: (yelling after them) I canât believe youâre gonna have sex on my engagement night!!

Chandler: Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)

[Cut to Rachelâs bedroom.]

Ross: Look uh, if weâre gonna do thisâ¦

Rachel: Weâre not gonna do this, all right? Sheâs just gonna think that weâre doinâ it.

Ross: Oh, I see, so everybody wins.

(Thereâs a knock on the door.)

Rachel: Who is it?

Monica: (outside the door) Itâs Monica, open up!

Rachel: Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him to follow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)

Ross: Oww!

Rachel: Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) May we help you?

Monica: I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement Iâm going to announce that Iâm pregnant!

Chandler: How is that ever going to happen?!

Rachel: All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!

Monica: I know why!

Rachel: No you donât know why!

Monica: Okay! Why?!

Rachel: Because! Because I was sad.

Monica: What do you mean?

Rachel: Look, I am soâ¦so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that Iâm not. Iâm not even close. And I donât know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that thatâs dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!

(Ross looks at Chandler.)

Chandler: (To Ross) I donât care, she slept with me.

Rachel: Anyway sweetie, I am, Iâm so sorry I ruined your night.

Monica: (starting to cry) Iâm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross. (They hug.)

Ross: (deadpan) Well, Iâm going to take off. (To Chandler) Congratulations man.

Chandler: Thanks.

Ross: (at the door) And uh, Rachel.

Rachel: Yeah.

Ross: What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person whoâs going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (Quickly realizes what he said and exits disgustedly.)

Rachel: Yeah Pheebs, honey, she just got engaged a couple of hours ago. I doubt sheâs even had time toâ¦

Phoebe: Well speaking of chiming in, remember the time you burned down my apartment?

Rachel: (To Monica) Yeah, youâre on your own.

Monica: Yâknow what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.

(They all agree and start to go and get ready.)

Joey: But I-I-I canât stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. Iâm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. (Everyone stops in their tracks upon hearing this.) What?

Chandler: So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?

Joey: You guys donât think I look 19?

(A brief silence ensues.)

Phoebe: Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!

[Scene: Monica and Chandlerâs bedroom, theyâre getting ready.]

Monica: (looking at her hand) Yâknow what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! (Sees Chandler sitting on the bed.) Youâre not getting dressed. (Chandler quietly folds over the comforter on the bed making a spot for her.)

Chandler: Know what I mean?

Monica: Yeah, but I donât think we have time.

Chandler: Thereâs gonna be a wedding. Youâre gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.

Monica: (chasing after him) Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, donât worry about it!

Chandler: (motioning with his hands) Iâm not worried, Iâm uh, Iâm fascinated. Yâknow itâs like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. (Exits as Phoebe enters from her room with her guitar.)

Phoebe: Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. (Singing)

"First time I met Chandler, I thought he was gay.
But here I am singing on his wedding day!"

Monica: Phoebe!

Phoebe: If you wouldâve let me finish, it goes on to say that heâs probably not gay.

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Chandler is looking at the foosball table.]

Rachel: Ohhâ¦

Ross: You okay?

Rachel: Yeah, I guess. I-Iâ¦ I mean, do-do you think weâre ever gonna have that?

Ross: You mean, weâyou and me?

Rachel: Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.

Ross: Oh good, you scared me for a minute.

Rachel: Shake it off.

Ross: I meanâno, itâs just âcause, itâs just âcause you and I were like a nightmare. (Screams.) No, but there was some good times.

Rachel: No, absolutely. Yâknow like it was ummâ¦

Ross: Surely you can think of something good.

Rachel: Yeah, just give me a minute! (Thinking) Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.

Ross: What?

Rachel: Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.

Ross: Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?

Rachel: Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.

Ross: My hands?

Rachel: Yeah.

Ross: Yeah?

Rachel: Uh-huh.

Ross: (to his hands) Way to go guys. Yâknow, you-you were really good at the stuff too.

Rachel: Oh, I know. Hey, yâknow what we never did? (Ross looks at her.) Oh no, not that. (Ross nods okay.) We uh, we never had bonus night!

Ross: A what?

Rachel: Yâknow, bonus night. Yâknow, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.

Ross: One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?

Rachel: Yeah-yeah, we never had that,

Ross: No.

[Silence.]

Ross: Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, Iâm-Iâm sure it would be amazing but Iâ¦gotta say I really-really donât think it would be a good idea. Yâknow? I really, reallyâ¦donât.

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Chandler is playing Playstation, Crash Team Racing to be exact (heâs in last on Hot Air Skyway to be more exact) as Joey enters from his room desperately trying to look like a 19-year-old. Heâs got the wool cap, heâs got the cut-off Knicks jersey over the faded T-shirt, and heâs got the whole pants-around-the-knees-showing-off-the-boxers thing that rich, white, suburban kids have adopted in a desperate and extremely futile attempt to try to look like theyâre from the inner-city.]

Joey: âSup? âSup dude?

Chandler: (putting his hands up) Take whatever you want, just please donât hurt me.

Joey: So youâre playing a little Playstation, huh? Thatâs whack! Playstation is whack! âSup with the whack Playstation, âsup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!

Chandler: Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.

Joey: Come on man, really how old?!

Chandler: Young! Youâre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodyâs ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!

Joey: Wow thanks! (He goes into his bedroom and closes the door.)

Chandler: Joe?

Joey: Yeah!

Chandler: Uhh, youâve had a lot of sex right?

Joey: When? Today? Some, not a lot.

Chandler: Well, itâs just the reason that Iâm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toâI mean I really wanted too, but I couldnâtâ¦. There huhâhmm, there-there was an incident.

Joey: Donât worry about that man, that happens.

Chandler: Itâs happened to you?

Joey: Yeah! Once.

Chandler: Well, whatâd you do?

Joey: I did it anyway.

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is in the living room and Phoebe is in her room.]

Monica: Phoebe! Come on! Letâs go! (Knocks on her door.) Come on! (Phoebe enters with guitar and not ready to go.) Why arenât you dressed yet?!

Phoebe: Iâm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out. (Gets ready to play.)

Monica: (grabs the guitar away from her) No, Phoebe, Iâll tell you what, if you get ready now Iâll let you play it at the wedding.

Phoebe: Really?! Oh thatâs so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again Iâll have to pound on you for a little bit.

Monica: Fair enough, now go get ready!

Phoebe: Okay. (She goes to get ready.)

Monica: Iâll get everybody else (Does so), finally we can start celebrating myâ(She gasps and is stopped by the sight of Ross and Rachel making out in the hall.) Iâm sorry, uh apparently Iâve opened the door to the past.

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, continued from before the commercial break. Monica is walking into the apartment followed by Ross and Rachel.]

Ross: Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just sawâ¦

Monica: (interrupting) Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?

Rachel: What?

Monica: See, Iâve been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people Iâm only planning on doing this once. So, uh yâknow, maybe this is selfish and Iâm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.

Rachel: Oh honey, but it is just aboutâ¦

Ross: It is! It is!

Monica: No itâs not! No! No! Now itâs about you and Ross getting back together!

Rachel: What?!

Monica: See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!

Ross: Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!

Rachel: Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!

Ross: Yeah!

Monica: Thatâs true.

Rachel: Honey I swear it we just kissed.

Ross: It was just a kiss. (Phoebe enters and overhears this.)

Phoebe: You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?

Monica: Thunder being stolen!!

Rachel: Okay come on Phoebe, itâs nothing! Monica, come on!

Ross: Look letâs not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesnât even matter!

(Chandler and Joey enter and overhear that.)

Joey: Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!

Chandler: (angrily) I donât think thatâs what they were talking about Joe!!

Phoebe: What a great night, Chandler canât do it, these guys kissedâ¦ (Points to Ross and Rachel.)

Joey: What?

Chandler: What?!

Joey: You guys kissed! Oh myâthis is huge!

Rachel: No!

Ross: Oh no!

Rachel: No-no, itâs really not huge.

Ross: And; people thinking itâs huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. (To Monica) Which we are not!

Monica: Well, weâre still talking about it, arenât we?

Phoebe: Well yeah, that and Chandlerâs problem.

Joey: Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.

Monica: Yes that would be lovely.

Joey: You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!

Chandler: Yes, you can pass for 19.

Joey: Really?

Chandler: Yes!

Joey: Seriously?

Chandler: Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!

Joey: (gasps) Iâm 30!

Rachel: Joey, you are not! Youâre 31.

Joey: (realizes) Aww crap!

Phoebe: Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, weâll get us some Mai Thaiâs, (To Chandler) maybe no more for you though.

Monica: Yâknow what? I-I think that umm, I donât feel like going to The Plaza.

Phoebe: Why?!

Rachel: Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Lookâ¦

Monica: No-no, I-I really donât want to talk about it! I donât! (To Rachel) Especially with you. (Goes into her room.)

Joey: Psss, that is whack!

[Time lapse, Phoebe is playing the guitar for Joey.]

Phoebe: (sheâs strumming something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Okay, I think Iâll play it at the wedding.

Joey: Yeah! Well, I think weâll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you donât."

Phoebe: Well, I donât think Monica is gonna take this away.

Joey: Wouldnât she?

Phoebe: Would she?

Joey: Would she? (He smells something and gasps as he realizes what it is.) You ate my candy bar!

[Scene: Rachelâs bedroom, sheâs pacing as Ross knocks on her door and opens it a little to stick his hands in.]

Ross: Guess who? (Enters fully.)

Rachel: Hey.

Ross: Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the airâ¦

Rachel: What do you think Monica mean when she said she didnât want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.

Ross: Still thinking about it huh?

Rachel: Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? (Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!

Ross: (loosening his tie) Oh, who cares?

Rachel: I care!

Ross: (tightening his tie) And so do I.

Rachel: Yâknow what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?

Ross: Okay. Sure. (Sits down on her bed.)

Rachel: Am I going to let you watch me undress?

Ross: (sitting up) No! (Exits.)

[Scene: Monica and Chandlerâs bedroom, they are both getting undressed.]

Monica: I canât believe her, yâknow itâs justâitâs so typical.

Chandler: Now Monica, I know youâre upset, but donât forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then thereâs going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.

Monica: Paris?

Chandler: We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).

Monica: Keep talking.

Chandler: Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because itâs romantic, but because I can!

Monica: I love you!

(They start making out and both start to feel something growing below the belt line.)

Monica: (in a French accent) Bonjour, monsieur.

Chandler: Okay, donât say anything, you might scare it away.

(There is a knock on the door.)

Chandler: Itâs Paris, who knows weâre here!

Monica: (opening the door) Hi Pheebs, whatâs up? (She enters.)

Phoebe: Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, Iâm just gonna need a small deposit.

Monica: What?!

Phoebe: Yâknow, just some good faith money to hold the date.

Chandler: Pheebs, weâre not giving you a deposit for our wedding!

Phoebe: Oh, I see. (Exits angrily.)

[Cut to the living room, Joey is eating a sandwich.)

Joey: They break your heart, donât they?

Phoebe: Yâknow, I donât really their permission.

Joey: Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!

Phoebe: Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then youâ¦ You gotta do something about your eyes.

Joey: What?! Whatâs wrong with my eyes.

Phoebe: They give you away! Thereâs just-thereâs just too much wisdom in there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.

Joey: And thatâll get rid of my wisdom?

Phoebe: Maybe just 10 minutes for you.

[Cut back to Monica and Chandlerâs room, they are making out again as thereâs another knock on the door.]

Chandler: Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I donât care!

(Monica opens the door to Ross and Rachel.)

Monica: Yes.

Rachel: Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didnât want to talk to anyone, especially me?

Chandler: What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!

Rachel: No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?

Monica: Well, letâs just say itâs not the first time youâve stolen my thunder.

Rachel: What?!

Ross: (To Rachel) Hey, hereâs a thought.

(Rachel ignores him and follows Monica into the kitchen.)

Rachel: Monica, what are you talking about?

Monica: My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.

Chandler: (entering) Ahh, third base.

Monica: Itâs all everybody at the party could talk about!

Rachel: Monica, yâknow what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!

Monica: (gasps) We had a characturist!

Rachel: Oh!!

Phoebe: (singing, angrily)

"Whenever I get married, guess who wonât get to sing?
Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!"

(Exits.)

Rachel: Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.

Monica: And yet, here we are doing it again.

Rachel: Ugh, Monica I donât want to steal your stupid thunder!

Monica: Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!

Ross: Got me. (He shows of his hands.)

Rachel: All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ainât gonna happen!

Monica: I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!

Rachel: I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!

Monica: Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!

Ross: Uh, Rachel, Iâve been thinking. I donât think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. Iâm calling it off.

Chandler: (To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.

Rachel: (ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?

Monica: I donât know! I donâtâmaybe youâre feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought youâd get married first! Maybe you canât stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!

Rachel: Oh wow. Thatâyâknow what? That is so unfair. Yâknow what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, letâs go have sex!

(Ross tries to dismiss it by making that sound, but decides to go for it and follows Rachel.)

Monica: (yelling after them) I canât believe youâre gonna have sex on my engagement night!!

Chandler: Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)

[Cut to Rachelâs bedroom.]

Ross: Look uh, if weâre gonna do thisâ¦

Rachel: Weâre not gonna do this, all right? Sheâs just gonna think that weâre doinâ it.

Ross: Oh, I see, so everybody wins.

(Thereâs a knock on the door.)

Rachel: Who is it?

Monica: (outside the door) Itâs Monica, open up!

Rachel: Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him to follow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)

Ross: Oww!

Rachel: Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) May we help you?

Monica: I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement Iâm going to announce that Iâm pregnant!

Chandler: How is that ever going to happen?!

Rachel: All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!

Monica: I know why!

Rachel: No you donât know why!

Monica: Okay! Why?!

Rachel: Because! Because I was sad.

Monica: What do you mean?

Rachel: Look, I am soâ¦so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that Iâm not. Iâm not even close. And I donât know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that thatâs dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!

(Ross looks at Chandler.)

Chandler: (To Ross) I donât care, she slept with me.

Rachel: Anyway sweetie, I am, Iâm so sorry I ruined your night.

Monica: (starting to cry) Iâm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross. (They hug.)

Ross: (deadpan) Well, Iâm going to take off. (To Chandler) Congratulations man.

Chandler: Thanks.

Ross: (at the door) And uh, Rachel.

Rachel: Yeah.

Ross: What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person whoâs going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (Quickly realizes what he said and exits disgustedly.)

Monica: Yâknow what we should do? We should all get dressed up and go to have champagne at The Plaza.

(They all agree and start to go and get ready.)

Joey: But I-I-I canât stay too long, I gotta get up early for a commercial audition tomorrow and I gotta look good. Iâm supposed to be playing a 19-year-old. (Everyone stops in their tracks upon hearing this.) What?

Chandler: So when you said, "Get up early," did you mean 1986?

Joey: You guys donât think I look 19?

(A brief silence ensues.)

Phoebe: Oh, 19! We thought you said 90!

(They all politely laugh and stop just as quickly.)

Monica: Okay everybody, letâs go! Letâs go!

Rachel: Okay.

Chandler: Okay.

(They all leave and Joey comes back in quickly.)

Joey: (To Phoebe) Hey, is uh the rest of my candy bar around here?

Phoebe: Oh honey no, you ate it all.

Joey: I was afraid of that.

(Walks out and after he closes the door Phoebe turns around and takes a bite out of what is left of his candy bar.)

[Scene: Monica and Chandlerâs bedroom, theyâre getting ready.]

Monica: (looking at her hand) Yâknow what shoes would look great with this ring? Diamond shoes! (Sees Chandler sitting on the bed.) Youâre not getting dressed. (Chandler quietly folds over the comforter on the bed making a spot for her.)

Chandler: Know what I mean?

Monica: Yeah, but I donât think we have time.

Chandler: Thereâs gonna be a wedding. Youâre gonna be the bride. Two hundred people are going to be looking at you in a clean white dress.

Monica: (lustily) Letâs do it! (She kisses him and they fall back onto the bed.)

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, time lapse, Chandler is fully dressed and slowly walking out of the bedroom with a distressed look on his face.]

Monica: (chasing after him) Chandler! It happens to lots of guys! You-you-you were probably tired, you had a lot of champagne, donât worry about it!

Chandler: (motioning with his hands) Iâm not worried, Iâm uh, Iâm fascinated. Yâknow itâs like uh, Biology! Which is funny because in high school I uh, I-I failed Biology and tonight Biology failed me. (Exits as Phoebe enters from her room with her guitar.)

Phoebe: Check it out. Okay, I can play this when the guests are coming in. Okay. (Singing)

"First time I met Chandler, I thought he was gay.
But here I am singing on his wedding day!"

Monica: Phoebe!

Phoebe: If you wouldâve let me finish, it goes on to say that heâs probably not gay.

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Chandler is looking at the foosball table.]

Chandler: Sure, you guys donât have this problem, youâre made of wood. (Rachel comes out of the bathroom) Hey!

Rachel: Hey!

Chandler: You look great!

Rachel: (quietly) Oh, thanks.

Chandler: You okay over there?

Rachel: I donât know, yâknow? I feel a little ummâ¦ No, yâknow what? Nevermind, Iâm gonna be fine.

Chandler: Oh, donât worry about it I mean you probably were tired, you had a lot of champagne, it happens to everybody.

[Rachel exits into the hallway just as Ross is coming up the stairs.]

Ross: Hey!

Rachel: Hi!

Ross: Wow! Happy Monicaâs night!

Rachel: Well thank you, you too.

Ross: Thanks.

Rachel: Hey, do you believe this? Do you believe they are actually getting married?

Ross: Well sure. But I get married all the time soâ¦

Rachel: Ohhâ¦

Ross: You okay?

Rachel: Yeah, I guess. I-Iâ¦ I mean, do-do you think weâre ever gonna have that?

Ross: You mean, weâyou and me?

Rachel: Oh no-no-no-no-no, no, no! We, you with someone and me with someone.

Ross: Oh good, you scared me for a minute.

Rachel: Shake it off.

Ross: I meanâno, itâs just âcause, itâs just âcause you and I were like a nightmare. (Screams.) No, but there was some good times.

Rachel: No, absolutely. Yâknow like it was ummâ¦

Ross: Surely you can think of something good.

Rachel: Yeah, just give me a minute! (Thinking) Oh well, yes, I can think of one good thing.

Ross: What?

Rachel: Well you uh, you were always really good at the uh, at the uh the stuff.

Ross: Yeah? I was good at the stuff huh?

Rachel: Uh-hmm, uh-hmm, yeah, yeah, I really liked your hands.

Ross: My hands?

Rachel: Yeah.

Ross: Yeah?

Rachel: Uh-huh.

Ross: (to his hands) Way to go guys. Yâknow, you-you were really good at the stuff too.

Rachel: Oh, I know. Hey, yâknow what we never did? (Ross looks at her.) Oh no, not that. (Ross nods okay.) We uh, we never had bonus night!

Ross: A what?

Rachel: Yâknow, bonus night. Yâknow, when two people break up but they get back together for just one night.

Ross: One night, just-just sex. No strings attached?

Rachel: Yeah-yeah, we never had that,

Ross: No.

[Silence.]

Ross: Okay, this is getting a little crazy. I mean, Iâm-Iâm sure it would be amazing but Iâ¦gotta say I really-really donât think it would be a good idea. Yâknow? I really, reallyâ¦donât.

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Chandler is playing Playstation, Crash Team Racing to be exact (heâs in last on Hot Air Skyway to be more exact) as Joey enters from his room desperately trying to look like a 19-year-old. Heâs got the wool cap, heâs got the cut-off Knicks jersey over the faded T-shirt, and heâs got the whole pants-around-the-knees-showing-off-the-boxers thing that rich, white, suburban kids have adopted in a desperate and extremely futile attempt to try to look like theyâre from the inner-city.]

Joey: âSup? âSup dude?

Chandler: (putting his hands up) Take whatever you want, just please donât hurt me.

Joey: So youâre playing a little Playstation, huh? Thatâs whack! Playstation is whack! âSup with the whack Playstation, âsup?! Huh? Come on, am I 19 or what?!

Chandler: Yes, on a scale from 1 to 10, 10 being the dumbest a person can look, you are definitely 19.

Joey: Come on man, really how old?!

Chandler: Young! Youâre a man-child okay?! Now go get changed because everybodyâs ready and please, oh please, keep my underwear!

Joey: Wow thanks! (He goes into his bedroom and closes the door.)

Chandler: Joe?

Joey: Yeah!

Chandler: Uhh, youâve had a lot of sex right?

Joey: When? Today? Some, not a lot.

Chandler: Well, itâs just the reason that Iâm asking is because I kind of eh, uh, I was unable toâI mean I really wanted too, but I couldnâtâ¦. There huhâhmm, there-there was an incident.

Joey: Donât worry about that man, that happens.

Chandler: Itâs happened to you?

Joey: Yeah! Once.

Chandler: Well, whatâd you do?

Joey: I did it anyway.

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is in the living room and Phoebe is in her room.]

Monica: Phoebe! Come on! Letâs go! (Knocks on her door.) Come on! (Phoebe enters with guitar and not ready to go.) Why arenât you dressed yet?!

Phoebe: Iâm sorry, but I just wrote the best dance song for your wedding. Check this out. (Gets ready to play.)

Monica: (grabs the guitar away from her) No, Phoebe, Iâll tell you what, if you get ready now Iâll let you play it at the wedding.

Phoebe: Really?! Oh thatâs so exciting! Thank you! Thanks Mon! Oh but Mon, if you touch my guitar again Iâll have to pound on you for a little bit.

Monica: Fair enough, now go get ready!

Phoebe: Okay. (She goes to get ready.)

Monica: Iâll get everybody else (Does so), finally we can start celebrating myâ(She gasps and is stopped by the sight of Ross and Rachel making out in the hall.) Iâm sorry, uh apparently Iâve opened the door to the past.

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, continued from before the commercial break. Monica is walking into the apartment followed by Ross and Rachel.]

Ross: Okay, Monica. Mon, uh what-what you just sawâ¦

Monica: (interrupting) Can I ask you just a little question, huh? Why tonight?

Rachel: What?

Monica: See, Iâve been waiting my whole life to be engaged, and unlike some people Iâm only planning on doing this once. So, uh yâknow, maybe this is selfish and Iâm sorry about it, but I was kinda hoping tonight could just be about that.

Rachel: Oh honey, but it is just aboutâ¦

Ross: It is! It is!

Monica: No itâs not! No! No! Now itâs about you and Ross getting back together!

Rachel: What?!

Monica: See yeah umm, you kinda stole my thunder!

Ross: Okay! Ho-ho! We did not steal your thunder because we are not getting back together!

Rachel: Yeah. No. And you know what? Nobody even saw!

Ross: Yeah!

Monica: Thatâs true.

Rachel: Honey I swear it we just kissed.

Ross: It was just a kiss. (Phoebe enters and overhears this.)

Phoebe: You guys kissed!!!!! What does this mean?!! Are you, are you getting back together?! Can I sing at your wedding?

Monica: Thunder being stolen!!

Rachel: Okay come on Phoebe, itâs nothing! Monica, come on!

Ross: Look letâs not make a big deal out of this! It was a one time thing. It doesnât even matter!

(Chandler and Joey enter and overhear that.)

Joey: Oh my God! I cannot believe you guys are talking about this! The problems in the bedroom are between the man and the woman!!! All right?!! Now Chandler is doing the best he can!!

Chandler: (angrily) I donât think thatâs what they were talking about Joe!!

Phoebe: What a great night, Chandler canât do it, these guys kissedâ¦ (Points to Ross and Rachel.)

Joey: What?

Chandler: What?!

Joey: You guys kissed! Oh myâthis is huge!

Rachel: No!

Ross: Oh no!

Rachel: No-no, itâs really not huge.

Ross: And; people thinking itâs huge has led Monica to believe that we are stealing her thunder. (To Monica) Which we are not!

Monica: Well, weâre still talking about it, arenât we?

Phoebe: Well yeah, that and Chandlerâs problem.

Joey: Monica-Monica-Monica-Monica, listen-listen, listen, listen, would-would it make you feel better if we all stop talking about Ross and Rachel.

Monica: Yes that would be lovely.

Joey: You got it. Okay. Now, I can pass for 19 right?!

Chandler: Yes, you can pass for 19.

Joey: Really?

Chandler: Yes!

Joey: Seriously?

Chandler: Seriously? Seriously, no! You can play your own age which is 31!

Joey: (gasps) Iâm 30!

Rachel: Joey, you are not! Youâre 31.

Joey: (realizes) Aww crap!

Phoebe: Okay, so The Plaza! Okay, weâll get us some Mai Thaiâs, (To Chandler) maybe no more for you though.

Monica: Yâknow what? I-I think that umm, I donât feel like going to The Plaza.

Phoebe: Why?!

Rachel: Honey, Monica, this is ridiculous! Lookâ¦

Monica: No-no, I-I really donât want to talk about it! I donât! (To Rachel) Especially with you. (Goes into her room.)

Joey: Psss, that is whack!

[Time lapse, Phoebe is playing the guitar for Joey.]

Phoebe: (sheâs strumming something) Yeah? (Joey nods yes.) Okay, I think Iâll play it at the wedding.

Joey: Yeah! Well, I think weâll see if they actually let you play. Huh? I mean they tell you anything you want to hear like-like, "You look 19," and then they just take it away like-like, "No you donât."

Phoebe: Well, I donât think Monica is gonna take this away.

Joey: Wouldnât she?

Phoebe: Would she?

Joey: Would she? (He smells something and gasps as he realizes what it is.) You ate my candy bar!

[Scene: Rachelâs bedroom, sheâs pacing as Ross knocks on her door and opens it a little to stick his hands in.]

Ross: Guess who? (Enters fully.)

Rachel: Hey.

Ross: Hey, I just realized we kinda let some stuff up in the airâ¦

Rachel: What do you think Monica mean when she said she didnât want to talk, especially with me? I mean, why not especially you and me? We were both out there kissing.

Ross: Still thinking about it huh?

Rachel: Come on! Serious-ser-ser-seriously, what did she mean by that? (Mimicking Monica.) Especially you!

Ross: (loosening his tie) Oh, who cares?

Rachel: I care!

Ross: (tightening his tie) And so do I.

Rachel: Yâknow what, I-I have to go talk to her, would you let me just get changed?

Ross: Okay. Sure. (Sits down on her bed.)

Rachel: Am I going to let you watch me undress?

Ross: (sitting up) No! (Exits.)

[Scene: Monica and Chandlerâs bedroom, they are both getting undressed.]

Monica: I canât believe her, yâknow itâs justâitâs so typical.

Chandler: Now Monica, I know youâre upset, but donât forget. There is going to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then thereâs going to be a honeymoon, maybe in Paris.

Monica: Paris?

Chandler: We will take a moonlit walk on the Rue de la (mumbles something).

Monica: Keep talking.

Chandler: Then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. Not just because itâs romantic, but because I can!

Monica: I love you!

(They start making out and both start to feel something growing below the belt line.)

Monica: (in a French accent) Bonjour, monsieur.

Chandler: Okay, donât say anything, you might scare it away.

(There is a knock on the door.)

Chandler: Itâs Paris, who knows weâre here!

Monica: (opening the door) Hi Pheebs, whatâs up? (She enters.)

Phoebe: Okay, you said I could sing at your wedding so, Iâm just gonna need a small deposit.

Monica: What?!

Phoebe: Yâknow, just some good faith money to hold the date.

Chandler: Pheebs, weâre not giving you a deposit for our wedding!

Phoebe: Oh, I see. (Exits angrily.)

[Cut to the living room, Joey is eating a sandwich.)

Joey: They break your heart, donât they?

Phoebe: Yâknow, I donât really their permission.

Joey: Yeah! If you wanna sing at their wedding, well you sing at their wedding!

Phoebe: Yeah! And if you wanna look 19, then youâ¦ You gotta do something about your eyes.

Joey: What?! Whatâs wrong with my eyes.

Phoebe: They give you away! Thereâs just-thereâs just too much wisdom in there. (Joey nods in agreement.) Just put some tea bags on there for like 15 minutes.

Joey: And thatâll get rid of my wisdom?

Phoebe: Maybe just 10 minutes for you.

[Cut back to Monica and Chandlerâs room, they are making out again as thereâs another knock on the door.]

Chandler: Oh, give her the deposit! Give her the ring! I donât care!

(Monica opens the door to Ross and Rachel.)

Monica: Yes.

Rachel: Monica, what did you mean before when you said you didnât want to talk to anyone, especially me?

Chandler: What a great apology! (To Monica) And you accept! Okay, bye-bye!

Rachel: No-no, seriously-seriously, what was the especially me part about?

Monica: Well, letâs just say itâs not the first time youâve stolen my thunder.

Rachel: What?!

Ross: (To Rachel) Hey, hereâs a thought.

(Rachel ignores him and follows Monica into the kitchen.)

Rachel: Monica, what are you talking about?

Monica: My Sweet Sixteen! Remember, you went to third base with my cousin Charlie.

Chandler: (entering) Ahh, third base.

Monica: Itâs all everybody at the party could talk about!

Rachel: Monica, yâknow what? The only reason I did that was because your party was so boring!

Monica: (gasps) We had a characturist!

Rachel: Oh!!

Phoebe: (singing, angrily)

"Whenever I get married, guess who wonât get to sing?
Somebody named Geller! And somebody else named Bing!"

(Exits.)

Rachel: Monica, your Sweet Sixteen was like a million years ago.

Monica: And yet, here we are doing it again.

Rachel: Ugh, Monica I donât want to steal your stupid thunder!

Monica: Oh please! Why else would you have made out with Ross?!

Ross: Got me. (He shows of his hands.)

Rachel: All right, easy mimey, the moment has passed, it ainât gonna happen!

Monica: I just thought it would be nice if I could have just this one night!

Rachel: I swear, I never wanted any part of your night!

Monica: Oh, is that why you did it the secret hallway where nobody ever goes?!

Ross: Uh, Rachel, Iâve been thinking. I donât think us getting together tonight is such a good idea. Iâm calling it off.

Chandler: (To Ross) Why to save your dignity my man.

Rachel: (ignoring them) Monica, why? Why would I ever want to take away from your night?

Monica: I donât know! I donâtâmaybe youâre feeling a little resentful. Maybe ah, maybe you thought youâd get married first! Maybe you canât stand the fact that your formally fat friend is getting married before you!

Rachel: Oh wow. Thatâyâknow what? That is so unfair. Yâknow what? Now I want to steal your thunder! Come on Ross, letâs go have sex!

(Ross tries to dismiss it by making that sound, but decides to go for it and follows Rachel.)

Monica: (yelling after them) I canât believe youâre gonna have sex on my engagement night!!

Chandler: Well, somebody should. (Monica glares at him.)

[Cut to Rachelâs bedroom.]

Ross: Look uh, if weâre gonna do thisâ¦

Rachel: Weâre not gonna do this, all right? Sheâs just gonna think that weâre doinâ it.

Ross: Oh, I see, so everybody wins.

(Thereâs a knock on the door.)

Rachel: Who is it?

Monica: (outside the door) Itâs Monica, open up!

Rachel: Okay well Ross! Stop it please! Wait a minute! (Motions for him to follow her lead, but he angrily shakes his head no. So she pokes him.)

Ross: Oww!

Rachel: Yeah, you like that baby? (Monica bursts in followed by Chandler.) May we help you?

Monica: I just wanted to say that I hope you do have sex tonight and I hope that you guys get back together, but I must warn you, the night that you announce your engagement Iâm going to announce that Iâm pregnant!

Chandler: How is that ever going to happen?!

Rachel: All right Monica, do you want to know why I was with Ross tonight?!

Monica: I know why!

Rachel: No you donât know why!

Monica: Okay! Why?!

Rachel: Because! Because I was sad.

Monica: What do you mean?

Rachel: Look, I am soâ¦so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that Iâm not. Iâm not even close. And I donât know, maybe I just wanted to make myself feel better. And I know that thatâs dumb, but oh my God you were so depressed when Ross got married that you slept with Chandler!

(Ross looks at Chandler.)

Chandler: (To Ross) I donât care, she slept with me.

Rachel: Anyway sweetie, I am, Iâm so sorry I ruined your night.

Monica: (starting to cry) Iâm sorry I almost made you sleep with Ross. (They hug.)

Ross: (deadpan) Well, Iâm going to take off. (To Chandler) Congratulations man.

Chandler: Thanks.

Ross: (at the door) And uh, Rachel.

Rachel: Yeah.

Ross: What can I say, you missed your chance. From now on the only person whoâs going to enjoy these bad boys (holds up his hands) is me. (Quickly realizes what he said and exits disgustedly.)

Monica: (entering from her room) Oww!

Chandler: Whatâs the matter honey?

Monica: I donât know, my hand feels weird. I guess itâs because, Iâm engaged! (Shows off the ring.) How long before it starts getting annoying?

Monica: This baby has got everything. Take yâknow, locations for instance. (She opens up the binder to the locations chapter.) First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.

Phoebe: That is so smart! (To Chandler, under her breath) Break it off. Break it off now.

Phoebe: Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yâknow? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?

Ross: Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-whatâs wrong with Monica and Chandler?

Phoebe: NothingâWhy?!

Ross: Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!

Phoebe: Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just donât know what the big deal is!

Rachel: Hey-hey, yâknow what? I donât care! Iâm not ashamed of my book. Thereâs nothing with a woman enjoying a littleâ¦erotica. Itâs just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. (She goes into her room.)

Mrs. Geller: So Chandler, youâre parents mustâve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.

Chandler: Oh yeah, I should probably call them.

Mr. Geller: I remember when we first got engaged.

Chandler: Oh, I donât think I ever heard that story.

Monica: Oh dad, really you donât need toâ¦

Mr. Geller: (ignoring her) Well, Iâd gotten Judy pregnant. I still donât know that happened.

Mrs. Geller: (incredulous) You donât know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!

Chandler: What a sweet story.

Monica: Well, at least youâre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.

Mr. Geller: What?! They wanted a scary story!

Monica: Anyway, weâre really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon weâll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. (Chandler and her laugh, but her parents donât.) What?

Mrs. Geller: You tell her Jack, I canât do it.

Mr. Geller: We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.

Commercial Break

[Scene: A Restaurant, scene continued from before the break.]

Monica: I donât believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!

Mrs. Geller: Weâre sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 youâd pay for it yourself.

Monica: You bought the beach house when I was 23!

Mr. Geller: Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you canât put a price on that sweetie.

Mrs. Geller: We really do feel bad about this though.

Mr. Geller: We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.

Monica: What about when I started dating Chandler?

Mrs. Geller: Well it was Chandler! We didnât think heâd ever propose!

Chandler: Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. (Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)

Monica: I canât believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!

Mrs. Geller: We might still have some money, if your father didnât think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.

Mr. Geller: It seemed like such a simple idea.

Mrs. Geller: Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.

Mr. Geller: All right, enough! I donât want to hear about it anymore! (Under his breath) Good luck, Chandler. (Chandler takes another drink.)

Rachel: Well what happened at dinner?

Monica: My parents spent the money for our wedding!

Phoebe: (gasps) My God! What did you order?!

Rachel: Wait, but thereâs no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!

Chandler: Honey, itâs gonna be okay.

Monica: No! No itâs not! Itâs not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!

Rachel: No, yâknow what? Itâs gonna be okay. I mean you donât have to have this rustic Italian feast. Yâknow? And-and you donât need, you donât need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. (She starts to cry, as does Monica.)

Chandler: Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that weâre gonna get married.

Rachel: Do you even understand what off the rack means?!

Phoebe: Look, why donât you just pay for it yourself?

Monica: How? I donât have any money.

Chandler: Well, I have some.

Monica: How much?

Rachel: Ohh! (Whispers.) Really?!

Monica: (To Chandler) How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!

Rachel: (starting to cry) Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.

Chandler: Well, youâre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?

Rachel and Monica: Ah, yeah!

Chandler: Well, come on, Iâve been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.

Phoebe: (reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello, Mr. Chandler.

Monica: This is the most special day of our lives.

Chandler: No, I realize that honey, but Iâm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.

Monica: Honey, umm I-I love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? (Laughs) Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, weâre only gonna get married once.

Chandler: Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.

Monica: You-youâre gonna have to put your foot down?

Phoebe: My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.

Ross: (incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!

Phoebe: He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.

Ross: Okay, so it wasnât uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.

Phoebe: Well, heâs never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!

Ross: Hey, yâknow what? This is your fault! Youâre the one that didnât move his-his appointment.

Phoebe: Oh, itâs my fault?! You didnât have to massage him! You couldâve sent him away! You couldâve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!

Ross: He said he liked that!! Oh youâre right, youâre right. Iâm sorry.

Chandler: Ehh.

Monica: Eh, you work for that.

Chandler: Look, I thought about it too, and Iâm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.

Monica: You do?!

Chandler: Yeah, Iâm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then thatâs what weâre gonna do.

Monica: Oh, youâre so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?

Chandler: Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, yâknow? Weâll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.

Monica: You thought about that?

Chandler: Yeah.

Monica: How many kids were we gonna have?

Chandler: Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.

Monica: What else did you think about?

Chandler: Well, stuff like whereâd we live, yâknow? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Yâknow, we could have a cat that had a bell on itâs collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, weâd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.

Monica: (laughs) Yâknow what? I-I donât want a big, fancy wedding.

Chandler: Sure you do.

Monica: No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.

Chandler: You sure?

Monica: Uh-hmm.

Chandler: I love you so much.

Mrs. Geller: So Chandler, youâre parents mustâve been thrilled when you told them you were engaged.

Chandler: Oh yeah, I should probably call them.

Mr. Geller: I remember when we first got engaged.

Chandler: Oh, I donât think I ever heard that story.

Monica: Oh dad, really you donât need toâ¦

Mr. Geller: (ignoring her) Well, Iâd gotten Judy pregnant. I still donât know that happened.

Mrs. Geller: (incredulous) You donât know how that happened?! Your dog thought my diaphragm was a chew toy!

Chandler: What a sweet story.

Monica: Well, at least youâre not hearing it for the first time at your fifth grade Halloween party.

Mr. Geller: What?! They wanted a scary story!

Monica: Anyway, weâre really excited about our wedding plans, and well I guess pretty soon weâll be making a big withdrawal from the Monica wedding fund. (Chandler and her laugh, but her parents donât.) What?

Mrs. Geller: You tell her Jack, I canât do it.

Monica: What happened? You still have the Monica wedding fund donât you?

Mr. Geller: We have it. Only now, we call it the beach house.

Commercial Break

[Scene: A Restaurant, scene continued from before the break.]

Monica: I donât believe you spent my wedding fund on the beach house!

Mrs. Geller: Weâre sorry honey, but we just assumed if you got married after you turned 30 youâd pay for it yourself.

Monica: You bought the beach house when I was 23!

Mr. Geller: Which means you had seven years of beach fun and you canât put a price on that sweetie.

Mrs. Geller: We really do feel bad about this though.

Mr. Geller: We started saving again when you were dating Richard and then that went to hell, so we redid the kitchen.

Monica: What about when I started dating Chandler?

Mrs. Geller: Well it was Chandler! We didnât think heâd ever propose!

Chandler: Clearly I did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal. (Starts to make up for lost time and takes a big swig of his drink.)

Monica: I canât believe it! That there is no money for my wedding?!

Mrs. Geller: We might still have some money, if your father didnât think it was a good idea to sell ice over the Internet.

Mr. Geller: It seemed like such a simple idea.

Mrs. Geller: Stupid Jack, the word is stupid.

Mr. Geller: All right, enough! I donât want to hear about it anymore! (Under his breath) Good luck, Chandler. (Chandler takes another drink.)

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica and Chandler are returning from dinner, Rachel is already there.]

Monica: I canât believe this. Do you think that your parents could help pay for it?

Chandler: I donât know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourth wedding. Sheâs saving the rest for her divorce. And any extra cash my father has he saves for his yearly trips to (Pause) Dollywood.

Rachel: Well what happened at dinner?

Monica: My parents spent the money for our wedding!

Phoebe: (gasps) My God! What did you order?!

Rachel: Wait, but thereâs no money! Well this is terrible! You guys are gonna have to get married in like a, rec. center!

Chandler: Honey, itâs gonna be okay.

Monica: No! No itâs not! Itâs not gonna be okay! It sucks! No swing band! No lilies!

Rachel: No, yâknow what? Itâs gonna be okay. I mean you donât have to have this rustic Italian feast. Yâknow? And-and you donât need, you donât need this custom-made, empire waisted, duchess, satin gown; you can wear off the rack. (She starts to cry, as does Monica.)

Chandler: Look, it really is gonna be okay. The important thing is that we love each other and that weâre gonna get married.

Rachel: Do you even understand what off the rack means?!

Phoebe: Look, why donât you just pay for it yourself?

Monica: How? I donât have any money.

Chandler: Well, I have some.

Monica: How much?

Chandler: Well, close toâ¦ (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides to write it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.)

Monica: Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!

Monica: Itâs enough for wedding scenario eight.

Rachel: Ohh! (Whispers.) Really?!

Monica: (To Chandler) How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!

Rachel: (starting to cry) Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.

Chandler: Well, youâre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?

Rachel and Monica: Ah, yeah!

Chandler: Well, come on, Iâve been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.

Phoebe: (reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello, Mr. Chandler.

Monica: This is the most special day of our lives.

Chandler: No, I realize that honey, but Iâm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.

Monica: Honey, umm I-I love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? (Laughs) Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, weâre only gonna get married once.

Chandler: Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.

Monica: You-youâre gonna have to put your foot down?

Chandler: Yes, I am!

Phoebe: Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.

Rachel: (quietly) Joey.

Joey: Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?

Rachel: Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.

Joey: No-no-no, Iâm serious. You donât smell it? Somethingâs on fire.

Rachel: Well no, I donât smell anything.

Joey: Oh, yâknow what? Itâs probably just your burninâ loins.

Ross: (sitting down) Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?

Rachel: Nothing!

Ross: (takes a drink) Damn, this coffeeâs cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins? (Joey and he both laugh.)

Rachel: Yâknow, I can not believe you told him, Joey!

Ross: So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?

Rachel: Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you. (Exits.)

Ross: (chases her) Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! (Realizes a table of women overheard him.) (To that table.) âSup?

Phoebe: (entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!

Ross: (looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe) Iâm sorry?

Phoebe: My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.

Ross: (incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!

Phoebe: He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.

Ross: Okay, so it wasnât uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.

Phoebe: Well, heâs never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!

Ross: Hey, yâknow what? This is your fault! Youâre the one that didnât move his-his appointment.

Phoebe: Oh, itâs my fault?! You didnât have to massage him! You couldâve sent him away! You couldâve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!

Ross: He said he liked that!! Oh youâre right, youâre right. Iâm sorry.

Joey: Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?

Ross: His daughter was hot.

Joey: Gotcha.

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is looking at the wedding book as Monica enters.]

Monica: Hey.

Chandler: Hey.

Monica: Listen umm, Iâve been thinking, itâs not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.

Chandler: Ehh.

Monica: Eh, you work for that.

Chandler: Look, I thought about it too, and Iâm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.

Monica: You do?!

Chandler: Yeah, Iâm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then thatâs what weâre gonna do.

Monica: Oh, youâre so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?

Chandler: Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, yâknow? Weâll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.

Monica: You thought about that?

Chandler: Yeah.

Monica: How many kids were we gonna have?

Chandler: Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.

Monica: What else did you think about?

Chandler: Well, stuff like whereâd we live, yâknow? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Yâknow, we could have a cat that had a bell on itâs collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, weâd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.

Monica: (laughs) Yâknow what? I-I donât want a big, fancy wedding.

Chandler: Sure you do.

Monica: No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.

Chandler: You sure?

Monica: Uh-hmm.

Chandler: I love you so much.

Monica: I love you. (They kiss.) Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkinâ about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.

Chandler: Oh yeah, totally!

Monica: Oh good.

Joey: Huh?

Rachel: (starting to move closer to him) Thatâs right, I wanna do it with you! Iâve been trying to fight it, but you just said all the right things.

Joey: (nervously backing away) I-I-I-I did? (He puts a stool in front of her.)

Rachel: (moves the stool out of the way) Yeah! Ohh, Iâve been waitinâ so long to get on that body!

Joey: This body? (He backs into the kitchen.)

Rachel: Yeah thatâs right! Come on Joey; sex me up!

Joey: Hey-hey, youâre startinâ to sound like the butcherâs wife there in-in chapter seven.

Rachel: Oh, come on now, donât keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because youâre in for a rough ride! (He backs into the door.)

Monica: (returning) Okay! (Sets down a huge 3" 3-ring binder on the table.)

Chandler: What in Godâs name is that?!

Ross: Oh my God, the wedding book?! I havenât seen that since the forth grade!

Monica: This baby has got everything. Take yâknow, locations for instance. (She opens up the binder to the locations chapter.) First, organized alphabetically, then geographically, then by square footage.

Phoebe: That is so smart! (To Chandler, under her breath) Break it off. Break it off now.

Phoebe: Well, umm, not much. But, I was just thinking that since those guys just got engaged that maybe it would be nice if they had some privacy, yâknow? So, could I just move in with you for a couple days?

Ross: Umm, okay, yeah, sure. But wh-whatâs wrong with Monica and Chandler?

Phoebe: NothingâWhy?!

Ross: Phoebe, you said it was urgent!

Monica: All right umm, a string quartet for the procession.

Rachel: Aw.

Monica: A jazz trio for cocktails. The Bay City Rollers for dancing. Wait, that was from my sixth grade wedding.

Chandler: Well, you couldnât get them anyway. Ian doesnât plan anymore and Derrickâ¦ (Off of Rachel and Monicaâs looks) And Derrick is a name I shouldnât know.

Joey: (sitting up from the couch) Hey Mon, do you have another pillow? (Holds up one.) Yâknow, something a little snugglyer?

Chandler: Why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?

Joey: Well, the duckâ¦

Rachel: What?! The duck?! What the hell did the damn duck do now?!

Joey: Uh, well he did not get sick somewhere in there and it was immediately found and properly cleaned up!

Monica: Of course you can look at it! Yeah, I want your opinion too!

Chandler: Okay.

Monica: Here you go! What do you think about centerpieces?

(Heâs about to try out the couch but notices the bed in Rachelâs room. He walks into her room and feels the bed.) Thatâs so soft. (He pulls back the comforter.) Pillowcases!

Zelda looked at the chimney sweep. Her father, the vicarâ¦(Stops reading and thinks.) The vicar? (Continues reading) â¦wouldnât be home for hours. Her loins were burning.

Ross: And they knew about it?

Phoebe: (pause as she considers it) Okay, well Ross, what is this really about?

Ross: Look, this is my home and I want to be able to come and go whenever I want!

Phoebe: Okay, I will find someplace else to do the rest of my appointments. I just donât know what the big deal is!

Rachel: Hey-hey, yâknow what? I donât care! Iâm not ashamed of my book. Thereâs nothing with a woman enjoying a littleâ¦erotica. Itâs just a healthy expression of female sexuality, which by the way, you will never understand. (She goes into her room.)

Joey: You got porn!

[Scene: Ross's apartment, Ross is coming out of the living room carrying his salad and a puzzleâbeer! Cold beer.

Chandler: Well, close toâ¦ (Notices Rachel leaning in to hear and decides to write it on a piece of paper and hand it to Monica as Phoebe averts her eyes.)

Monica: Whoa!!! Are you kidding me?!

Rachel: Well what?! How-how much is it?!

Monica: Itâs enough for wedding scenario eight.

Rachel: Ohh! (Whispers.) Really?!

Monica: (To Chandler) How great are you, you little saver?! I mean, the-the amount you have is exactly the budget of my dream wedding!

Rachel: (starting to cry) Ohh, you guys are so made for each other.

Chandler: Well, youâre not suggesting that we spend all of the money on the wedding?

Rachel and Monica: Ah, yeah!

Chandler: Well, come on, Iâve been saving this money for six years and I kinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.

Phoebe: (reading the slip of paper) Wow! (In a sultry voice) Hello, Mr. Chandler.

Monica: This is the most special day of our lives.

Chandler: No, I realize that honey, but Iâm not gonna spend all of the money on one party.

Monica: Honey, umm I-I love you, (laughs) but umm, if you call our wedding a party one more time, you may not get invited. Okay? (Laughs) Listen, we could always earn more money, okay? But uh, weâre only gonna get married once.

Chandler: Look, I understand, but I have to put my foot down. Okay? The answer is no.

Monica: You-youâre gonna have to put your foot down?

Chandler: Yes, I am!

Phoebe: Wow, money and a firm hand. Finally a Chandler I can get on board with.

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Ross are there as Rachel enters and sees Joey sitting there.]

Joey: Hey Rach.

Rachel: (quietly) Joey.

Joey: Hey Rach, do you smell smoke?

Rachel: Uh-huh, I get it, smoke, chimney, chimney sweep, very funny, ha-ha.

Joey: No-no-no, Iâm serious. You donât smell it? Somethingâs on fire.

Rachel: Well no, I donât smell anything.

Joey: Oh, yâknow what? Itâs probably just your burninâ loins.

Ross: (sitting down) Hey, what are you guys, what are you guys talking about?

Rachel: Nothing!

Ross: (takes a drink) Damn, this coffeeâs cold! Hey Rach, do you mind if I heat this up on your loins? (Joey and he both laugh.)

Rachel: Yâknow, I can not believe you told him, Joey!

Ross: So I guess you bought that book after we broke up huh?

Rachel: Uh-huh, yeah I did, because I wore out my first copy when I was with you. (Exits.)

Ross: (chases her) Oh yeah, yeah? Well uh, when we were going out, I read tons of porno magazines! (Realizes a table of women overheard him.) (To that table.) âSup?

Phoebe: (entering) Ross! How could you do that to an old man?!

Ross: (looking at the table) Excuse me ladies. (To Phoebe) Iâm sorry?

Phoebe: My massage client, Arthur? His daughter called and said that some guy that worked for me gave him a really weird massage this afternoon.

Ross: (incredulous) I gave him an extremely professional massage!

Phoebe: He said you poked at him with wooden spoons.

Ross: Okay, so it wasnât uh, a traditional massage. But I did give him accu-pressure with a pair of chopsticks. And, and I gently exfoliated him with, with a mop.

Phoebe: Well, heâs never coming back! Okay? You just cost me eight dollars a week!

Ross: Hey, yâknow what? This is your fault! Youâre the one that didnât move his-his appointment.

Phoebe: Oh, itâs my fault?! You didnât have to massage him! You couldâve sent him away! You couldâve not rolled Tonka trucks up and down his back!

Ross: He said he liked that!! Oh youâre right, youâre right. Iâm sorry.

Joey: Dude, what are you massaging an old man for?

Ross: His daughter was hot.

Joey: Gotcha.

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is looking at the wedding book as Monica enters.]

Monica: Hey.

Chandler: Hey.

Monica: Listen umm, Iâve been thinking, itâs not fair for me to ask you to spend all of your money on our wedding. I mean, you work, you work really hard for that.

Chandler: Ehh.

Monica: Eh, you work for that.

Chandler: Look, I thought about it too, and Iâm sorry. I think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.

Monica: You do?!

Chandler: Yeah, Iâm putting my foot down. Yeah look, when I proposed I told you that I would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy then, then thatâs what weâre gonna do.

Monica: Oh, youâre so sweet. (They hug and kiss.) Oh, but wait, what about our, what about the future and stuff?

Chandler: Eh, forget about the future and stuff! So we only have two kids, yâknow? Weâll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.

Monica: You thought about that?

Chandler: Yeah.

Monica: How many kids were we gonna have?

Chandler: Uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.

Monica: What else did you think about?

Chandler: Well, stuff like whereâd we live, yâknow? Like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. Yâknow, we could have a cat that had a bell on itâs collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. Of course, weâd have an apartment over the garage where Joey could grow old.

Monica: (laughs) Yâknow what? I-I donât want a big, fancy wedding.

Chandler: Sure you do.

Monica: No, I want everything you just said. I want a marriage.

Chandler: You sure?

Monica: Uh-hmm.

Chandler: I love you so much.

Monica: I love you. (They kiss.) Hey listen umm, when, when you were talkinâ about our future you said cat, but you meant dog right.

Chandler: Oh yeah, totally!

Monica: Oh good.

Joey: This body? (He backs into the kitchen.)

Rachel: Yeah thatâs right! Come on Joey; sex me up!

Joey: Hey-hey, youâre startinâ to sound like the butcherâs wife there in-in chapter seven.

Rachel: Oh, come on now, donât keep me waiting. Get those clothes off! But, I would keep that helmet on because youâre in for a rough ride! (He backs into the door.)

Opening Credits

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, and Monica are making some sandwiches.]

Phoebe: So what do you guys want for an engagement present?

Chandler: Thatâs okay Pheebs, weâre not having a party or anything, so you donât have to get usâ¦

Monica: (interrupts him) If someone wants to give us a present, we donât want to deprive them of that joy.

Rachel: Oh, yâknow what you should get âem? One of those little uh, portable CD players.

Monica: Oh, I already have one.

Phoebe: Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.

Rachel: Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.

Monica: Hey, I know I what I want!

Chandler: What we want honey.

Monica: No, you donât want this. I want to have your grandmotherâs cookie recipe.

Phoebe: You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?

Monica: Uh-huh, yeah.

Phoebe: You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?

Chandler: Dying people say the craziest things.

Monica: I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.

Phoebe: Break my heartâOh, all right.

Monica: Okay. Iâm gonna be the mom that makes the worldâs best chocolate chip cookies.

Chandler: Our kids are gonna be fat arenât they.

Joey: (entering) Ahoy!

Chandler: Hey! Howâs the boat?!

Joey: Great! Iâm finally getting into this sailing stuff.

Monica: Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?

Joey: Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!

Phoebe: If you donât sail your boat, what do you do on it?

Joey: Oh, itâs great! Itâs a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. (He says that as he sits, hangs around, drinks a beer, and eats a chip.)

Chandler: Well, itâs good that you finally have a place to do that.

Rachel: Yâknow Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.

Joey: You could?

Rachel: Yeah! Iâve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.

Phoebe: Your own boat?

Rachel: What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Monica are there. He takes off his glasses and starts chewing on the ear piece.]

Chandler: Do you know what I was thinkinâ?

Monica: What?

Chandler: Nothing, I just like to go like this. (Does it again.)

Ross: (entering from the bathrooms) Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?

Chandler: Uh why, do you have a lecture?

Ross: No, why?

Chandler: Then free as a bird. Whatâs up?

Ross: My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.

Monica: Wow! Thatâs great! Dad must really like you, he doesnât ask just anyone to play.

Ross: Yeah and he didnât really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.

Chandler: Well, did-did you correct him?

Ross: No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.

Monica: This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.

Ross: Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.

Monica: Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.

Ross: Yeah.

Monica: He hates to lose.

Chandler: Oh no problem, maybe Iâll play with my left hand.

Ross: Youâre not a lefty?

Chandler: Does anybody know me?!

(Phoebe enters, walks up to Monica, and exhales exasperatedly.)

Monica: Whatâs wrong Phoebe?

Phoebe: I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!

Monica: No!! Why didnât you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!

Phoebe: (pauses as he figures out how to answer that) Because Iâm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.

Ross: Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?

Chandler: Donât worry about it Pheebs.

Ross: No one got me an engagement present.

Phoebe: Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. (She hands Monica a cookie in a plastic baggie.)

Chandler: An old cookie?

Monica: (To Chandler) This is what happens when you donât register for gifts!

Phoebe: See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.

Chandler: We canât accept this.

Phoebe: Why not?

Chandler: âCause itâs gross.

Monica: No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.

Phoebe: Really?!

Monica: Yeah! I bet I can do it.

(Chandler looks over and sees Ross glaring at them.)

Chandler: Okay, we owe you a present.

Ross: Two! Iâve been engaged twice!

[Scene: The Mr. Bowmont (Joeyâs boat), sheâs shown to be in one of the waterways around New York, but in reality sheâs in a sound stage on the Warner Bros. lot and we see New York from the water in some rather poor green screen shots. Rachel and Joey are on board.]

Joey: (drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because heâs got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way jackass! (To Rachel) Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?

Rachel: That is the Coast Guard.

Joey: What are they doing out here? The coastâs all the way over there. (Points to the coast, meanwhile there is coast behind him.)

Rachel: Joey, just ignore the boats all right? Weâre not finished with the lesson yet.

Joey: All right.

Rachel: Okay, Iâm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?

Joey: Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Letâs start sailing, and I want to go over there (Points) where that boatload of girls is! (Yelling to them) Yo-ho-ho!

Rachel: Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, letâs do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, (grabs some of the rigging) whatâs this called?

Joey: Uh, boat rope.

Rachel: Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?

Joey: Uhh, rub it?

Rachel: No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?

Joey: Iâd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uhâ¦

(Rachel blasts an air horn in his ear.)

Rachel: Timeâs up, now your dead.

Joey: And deaf!

Rachel: Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?! (She punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)

Joey: Yes.

Rachel: Donât just say yes! This isnât a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!

Joey: I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica and Phoebe are trying to determine the cookie recipe by eating small pieces.]

Monica: All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.

Phoebe: You do?

Monica: You donât? (Laughs) Well, thatâs the difference between a professional and a layman.

Phoebe: That and arrogance.

Joey: (entering) Hey.

Monica: Hey! How was sailing?

Joey: I donât want to talk about it. Yâknow, you couldâve at least saved me a whole cookie. (He grabs whatâs left of the cookie and pops in his mouth.)

Monica and Phoebe: No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!

Joey: (recoils in horror) Women are mean!!! (Storms out.)

Phoebe: I canât believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmotherâs legacy is this crumb. (She picks it up with her finger and holds it out to Monica.) I wish you a long and happy marriage.

Ross: (entering with Chandler) Hey.

Monica: Hey! How was it?

Ross: Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other handâ¦

Chandler: I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.

Ross: And what did he ask you not to call him?

Chandler: Daddy. All right look, hereâs the story. (Flashback to Chandler about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way around the steam filled room. He takes off his glasses.) So I take off my glasses and thatâs when in happened.

[Cut to the flashback, Chandlerâs no longer doing the voice-over.]

Chandler: Guys?

Ross: Over here. (You can see Ross sitting at the far wall.)

Mr. Geller: Have a seat son. (You can see Mr. Geller sitting closer to the door as Chandler walks over and sits in his lap.) Hey!! (Chandler quickly jumps off and sits next to him with a shocked expression on his face.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is finished telling everyone what happened.]

Monica: Oh my God Chandler! I canât believe it!

Chandler: I know.

Monica: You gave my father a lap dance!

Chandler: Why do they put so much steam in there?!

Ross: âCause otherwise theyâd have to call it the room room.

Chandler: Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?

Phoebe: Come on, itâs not that big a deal!

Chandler: Not that big a deal? Thereâ¦there was touching of things.

Ross: Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?

Monica: Listen, Iâm sure that dad doesnât care. He probably thought this was funny; heâll be telling this story for years!

Chandler: I donât want him to tell this story for years.

Ross: Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.

Monica: I wasnât escaping.

Ross: Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?

Monica: I was trying to help out a squirrel.

Ross: You were trying to eat it!

(The phone rings.)

Chandler: If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!

Monica: (takes the phone from Ross) Come on. (Answering phone) Hello? (Listens) Iâm sorry you have the wrong number. (Listens) (Whispering) Okay, Iâll call you later dad. I love you. (Hangs up.)

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Ross, and Rachel are there.]

Chandler: (getting up) All right, Iâm off to see your dad.

Ross: Whoa-whoa, arenât you a little over dressed?

Rachel: (laughing) Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.

Chandler: Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to faceâAnd by face I donât mean his lap. And by face, I donât mean my ass. (Exits.)

Ross: (To Rachel) Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?

Rachel: I donât know. Yâknow, they didnât get us anything.

Ross: Thank you!

Joey: (entering) Hey.

Ross: Hey.

Rachel: Well hello! So, when are we gettinâ back out on the water matey?

Joey: Oh uh, I donât know the boat way to say this, but uh never!

Rachel: Why not?

Joey: Because! Youâre mean on the boat!

Rachel: What? I was just trying to teach you.

Joey: Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!

Ross: Yeeeeeepâ¦ Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dadâs boat she wouldnât let me help at all.

Rachel: Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldnât move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.

Ross: You have to respect the sea! (Storms off.)

Rachel: Look Joey, Iâm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.

Joey: Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"

Rachel: Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?

Joey: Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?

Rachel: Yeah, I didnât want you to get hit by the boom!

Joey: Well it hit me anyway! And it wouldâve hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.

Rachel: All right, yâknow what? I-Iâm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.

Joey: You wonât boss me around anymore?

Rachel: I wonât boss you around.

Joey: And youâll be nice?

Rachel: And, Iâll be nice.

Joey: And youâll be topless?

Rachel: AndâJoey!

Joey: Do you want me to learn?!

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is trying out different cookie recipes. Ross and Phoebe are the tasting group.]

Monica: Okay, hereâs batch 22. Ohh, maybe theseâll taste a little like your grandmotherâs. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.

Ross: Letâs give it a shot.

Monica: Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.

Phoebe: Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?

Monica: No, just a Friday night.

(They all take a bite.)

Ross: Ohh, these are pretty good.

Phoebe: Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.

Ross: Which one was that?

Monica: The ones we had right after you almost threw up.

Ross: Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. (Burps a little bit.) Iâm okay.

Phoebe: Are there anymore from the good batch? âCause we could just work off of those.

Ross: Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uhâ¦ (Grabs a cookie and takes a big bite out of it and doesnât like it.) Itâs batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way! (Gets up and runs for the bathroom.)

[Scene: The Mr. Bowmont, its Joeyâs second lesson with Rachel as the resident sailing expert.]

Rachel: Okay Joey honey, youâre doing really good! All right, now Iâm just gonna need you to step to the port side. (Joey pauses as he tries to remember which side is the port side.) Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?

Joey: Ohh yeah.

Rachel: Right?

Joey: Nope.

Rachel: Itâs left sweetie, but thatâs okay sweetie, thatâs a tough one.

Joey: I donât know why you just donât say left.

Rachel: Okay, go to the left. (Joey goes starboard or sits on the right side of the boat.) The left!

Joey: Huh?

Rachel: (yelling) Just sit over there!! (Points to the port side.)

Joey: (hurrying over) Okay! Okay, youâre yelling again! See that?

Rachel: No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.

Joey: Oh, yâknow what? Since Iâm here, I think Iâm gonna have me a little beer on the port side. (Grabs and opens one.)

Rachel: Okay Joey, weâre luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham? (The mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working efficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)

Joey: Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didnât know there.

Rachel: Joey, come on! We just went over this! (She does it instead.)

Joey: Oh, yâknow, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!

Rachel: (angrily) No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!

Joey: All right thatâs it! Youâre yelling and I donât see you taking your top off! I quit!

Rachel: What do you mean you quit?! You canât quit!

Joey: Why not?!

Rachel: Because youâre not finished yet and I wonât have it! Greens do not quit!

Joey: Greens? Iâm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!

Rachel: Oh my God, wait did IâI just said Greens donât quit didnât I? (Pause) (Angrily) Did I just say Greens donât quit?!

Joey: Yes! Yes! You did and youâre still yelling at me!

Rachel: No! No! No! Iâm not yelling at you, Iâm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh Iâm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! Iâve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this cominâ. Oh, Joey, Iâm sorry. Iâm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.

Joey: Well, hey I did learn.

Rachel: Really?

Joey: Yeah! Come on.

Rachel: Awwwâ¦

Joey: Yeah, itâs okay. I know what a mainsail is. (Points to it. Itâs the larger sail.) I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.

Rachel: Left.

Joey: Damnit!

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, the cookie trying period has pasted. Monica, Phoebe, and Ross are reflecting on the dayâs events.]

Phoebe: Yâknow, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that weâre trying to figure out her recipe. I bet sheâs l-l-lookinâ up at us and smiling right now.

Ross: Looking up?

Phoebe: Oh yeahâNo, she was really nice to me, but sheâs in hell for sure.

Monica: Well, Iâve tried everything. I give up. I guess Iâm not gonna be the mom who makes the worldâs best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right.

Ross: Aww, Pheeb, come on isnât there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?

Phoebe: Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And thatâs not happening âtil October 15th, 2032.

Ross: Thatâs the day youâre gonna die? Seeâdarnit, Iâve got shuffleboard that day.

Phoebe: Thatâs what you think.

Monica: Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmotherâs? Wouldnât they have the recipe?

Phoebe: Well, yâknow I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.

Monica: What was her name?

Phoebe: Nesele Toulouse.

Monica: Nestle Tollhouse?!

Phoebe: Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.

Monica: (grabbing a bag of Nestle Tollhouse chocolate chips) Phoebe, is this the recipe? (Tosses her the bag.)

Phoebe: (reading the recipe on the back of the bag) Yes!! (Realizes.) Ohh.

Monica: I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!

Phoebe: I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why (Looking down) youâre burning in hell!!

[Scene: The Gym, Chandler and Mr. Geller are heading for the whirlpool room.]

Chandler: So you understand, Iâd feel a lot more comfortable if you didnât tell people what happened. Yâknow, Iâm a littleâ¦Iâm a little embarrassed about it.

Mr. Geller: I understand completely, thereâs nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.

Chandler: What did you do when they found out?

Mr. Geller: They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?

(Chandler nods along and they enter the whirlpool room and remove their robes. Only Chandler is lacking a certain item of clothing. You see this is a coed whirlpool, which means swimsuits, and in fact there are two women already there and Chandler didnât seem to wear his. Needless to say, everyone is shocked, including Chandler.)

Chandler: So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!

Ending Credits

[Scene: The Mr. Bowmont, is tied up alongside the pier; Joey and Rachel are relaxing.]

Rachel: Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.

Joey: Yeah, yeah. Hey, why donât you give a pull on that rope? (Points.)

Rachel: Ohh weâre not sailing.

Joey: Just pull on it.

Rachel: All right. (She does so and it brings the cooler closer together.) Hey-hey-hey!! (Sees whatâs in the cooler.) Sandwiches!

Joey: What else?

Rachel: (hands him one) Here you go.

Joey: Thank you.

Rachel: Oh wow! (She takes a bite, but holds the sandwich vertically so that the stuff falls out.)

Joey: What are you doing?

Rachel: Ohh, sorry.

Joey: What youâdonât hold it like that! Youâre lettinâ all the good stuff fall out.

(More falls out.)

Rachel: Ohh whoops.

Joey: Careful! Youâre wasting good pastrami! (Gasps.) Oh my God! Iâm my dad!


[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel, Phoebe, Joey, Ross, and Monica are all there as Chandler enters wearing glasses.]

Chandler: Hey, you guys!

Ross and Rachel: Hey!

Chandler: So, what do you think?

Ross: About what?

Rachel: Yeah, what?

Joey: What?

Chandler: Are you kidding? Okay, Iâll give you a hint; Iâll give you a hint. (Points to his glasses.)

Joey: Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandlerâs eyes!

Chandler: I got glasses!

Ross: Well, you-youâve always had glasses.

Chandler: No I didnât!

Ross: Are you sure?

Rachel: Yeah-yeah, did-didnât you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of ummâ¦

Joey: Feminine.

Rachel: Yes!

Chandler: No!

Monica: Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.

Chandler: Really?

Monica: Yeah!

Chandler: (sitting down on the arm of her chair) You didnât think I used to wear glasses, right?

Monica: Of course! (She mouths, "I have no idea," to the rest of the gang.)

Opening Credits

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, and Monica are making some sandwiches.]

Phoebe: So what do you guys want for an engagement present?

Chandler: Thatâs okay Pheebs, weâre not having a party or anything, so you donât have to get usâ¦

Monica: (interrupts him) If someone wants to give us a present, we donât want to deprive them of that joy.

Rachel: Oh, yâknow what you should get âem? One of those little uh, portable CD players.

Monica: Oh, I already have one.

Phoebe: Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.

Rachel: Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.

Monica: Hey, I know I what I want!

Chandler: What we want honey.

Monica: No, you donât want this. I want to have your grandmotherâs cookie recipe.

Phoebe: You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?

Monica: Uh-huh, yeah.

Phoebe: You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?

Chandler: Dying people say the craziest things.

Monica: I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.

Phoebe: Break my heartâOh, all right.

Monica: Okay. Iâm gonna be the mom that makes the worldâs best chocolate chip cookies.

Chandler: Our kids are gonna be fat arenât they.

Joey: (entering) Ahoy!

Chandler: Hey! Howâs the boat?!

Joey: Great! Iâm finally getting into this sailing stuff.

Monica: Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?

Joey: Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!

Phoebe: If you donât sail your boat, what do you do on it?

Joey: Oh, itâs great! Itâs a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. (He says that as he sits, hangs around, drinks a beer, and eats a chip.)

Chandler: Well, itâs good that you finally have a place to do that.

Rachel: Yâknow Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.

Joey: You could?

Rachel: Yeah! Iâve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.

Phoebe: Your own boat?

Rachel: What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Monica are there. He takes off his glasses and starts chewing on the ear piece.]

Chandler: Do you know what I was thinkinâ?

Monica: What?

Chandler: Nothing, I just like to go like this. (Does it again.)

Ross: (entering from the bathrooms) Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?

Chandler: Uh why, do you have a lecture?

Ross: No, why?

Chandler: Then free as a bird. Whatâs up?

Ross: My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.

Monica: Wow! Thatâs great! Dad must really like you, he doesnât ask just anyone to play.

Ross: Yeah and he didnât really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.

Chandler: Well, did-did you correct him?

Ross: No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.

Monica: This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.

Ross: Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.

Monica: Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.

Ross: Yeah.

Monica: He hates to lose.

Chandler: Oh no problem, maybe Iâll play with my left hand.

Ross: Youâre not a lefty?

Chandler: Does anybody know me?!

(Phoebe enters, walks up to Monica, and exhales exasperatedly.)

Monica: Whatâs wrong Phoebe?

Phoebe: I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!

Monica: No!! Why didnât you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!

Phoebe: (pauses as he figures out how to answer that) Because Iâm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.

Ross: Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?

Chandler: Donât worry about it Pheebs.

Ross: No one got me an engagement present.

Phoebe: Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. (She hands Monica a cookie in a plastic baggie.)

Chandler: An old cookie?

Monica: (To Chandler) This is what happens when you donât register for gifts!

Phoebe: See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.

Chandler: We canât accept this.

Phoebe: Why not?

Chandler: âCause itâs gross.

Monica: No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.

Phoebe: Really?!

Monica: Yeah! I bet I can do it.

(Chandler looks over and sees Ross glaring at them.)

Chandler: Okay, we owe you a present.

Ross: Two! Iâve been engaged twice!

[Scene: The Mr. Bowmont (Joeyâs boat), sheâs shown to be in one of the waterways around New York, but in reality sheâs in a sound stage on the Warner Bros. lot and we see New York from the water in some rather poor green screen shots. Rachel and Joey are on board.]

Joey: (drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because heâs got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way jackass! (To Rachel) Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?

Rachel: That is the Coast Guard.

Joey: What are they doing out here? The coastâs all the way over there. (Points to the coast, meanwhile there is coast behind him.)

Rachel: Joey, just ignore the boats all right? Weâre not finished with the lesson yet.

Joey: All right.

Rachel: Okay, Iâm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?

Joey: Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Letâs start sailing, and I want to go over there (Points) where that boatload of girls is! (Yelling to them) Yo-ho-ho!

Rachel: Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, letâs do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, (grabs some of the rigging) whatâs this called?

Joey: Uh, boat rope.

Rachel: Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?

Joey: Uhh, rub it?

Rachel: No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?

Joey: Iâd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uhâ¦

(Rachel blasts an air horn in his ear.)

Rachel: Timeâs up, now your dead.

Joey: And deaf!

Rachel: Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?! (She punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)

Joey: Yes.

Rachel: Donât just say yes! This isnât a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!

Joey: I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica and Phoebe are trying to determine the cookie recipe by eating small pieces.]

Monica: All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.

Phoebe: You do?

Monica: You donât? (Laughs) Well, thatâs the difference between a professional and a layman.

Phoebe: That and arrogance.

Joey: (entering) Hey.

Monica: Hey! How was sailing?

Joey: I donât want to talk about it. Yâknow, you couldâve at least saved me a whole cookie. (He grabs whatâs left of the cookie and pops in his mouth.)

Monica and Phoebe: No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!

Joey: (recoils in horror) Women are mean!!! (Storms out.)

Phoebe: I canât believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmotherâs legacy is this crumb. (She picks it up with her finger and holds it out to Monica.) I wish you a long and happy marriage.

Ross: (entering with Chandler) Hey.

Monica: Hey! How was it?

Ross: Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other handâ¦

Chandler: I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.

Ross: And what did he ask you not to call him?

Chandler: Daddy. All right look, hereâs the story. (Flashback to Chandler about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way around the steam filled room. He takes off his glasses.) So I take off my glasses and thatâs when in happened.

[Cut to the flashback, Chandlerâs no longer doing the voice-over.]

Chandler: Guys?

Ross: Over here. (You can see Ross sitting at the far wall.)

Mr. Geller: Have a seat son. (You can see Mr. Geller sitting closer to the door as Chandler walks over and sits in his lap.) Hey!! (Chandler quickly jumps off and sits next to him with a shocked expression on his face.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is finished telling everyone what happened.]

Monica: Oh my God Chandler! I canât believe it!

Chandler: I know.

Monica: You gave my father a lap dance!

Chandler: Why do they put so much steam in there?!

Ross: âCause otherwise theyâd have to call it the room room.

Chandler: Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?

Phoebe: Come on, itâs not that big a deal!

Chandler: Not that big a deal? Thereâ¦there was touching of things.

Ross: Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?

Monica: Listen, Iâm sure that dad doesnât care. He probably thought this was funny; heâll be telling this story for years!

Chandler: I donât want him to tell this story for years.

Ross: Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.

Monica: I wasnât escaping.

Ross: Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?

Monica: I was trying to help out a squirrel.

Ross: You were trying to eat it!

(The phone rings.)

Chandler: If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!

Monica: (takes the phone from Ross) Come on. (Answering phone) Hello? (Listens) Iâm sorry you have the wrong number. (Listens) (Whispering) Okay, Iâll call you later dad. I love you. (Hangs up.)

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Ross, and Rachel are there.]

Chandler: (getting up) All right, Iâm off to see your dad.

Ross: Whoa-whoa, arenât you a little over dressed?

Rachel: (laughing) Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.

Chandler: Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to faceâAnd by face I donât mean his lap. And by face, I donât mean my ass. (Exits.)

Ross: (To Rachel) Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?

Rachel: I donât know. Yâknow, they didnât get us anything.

Ross: Thank you!

Joey: (entering) Hey.

Ross: Hey.

Rachel: Well hello! So, when are we gettinâ back out on the water matey?

Joey: Oh uh, I donât know the boat way to say this, but uh never!

Rachel: Why not?

Joey: Because! Youâre mean on the boat!

Rachel: What? I was just trying to teach you.

Joey: Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!

Ross: Yeeeeeepâ¦ Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dadâs boat she wouldnât let me help at all.

Rachel: Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldnât move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.

Ross: You have to respect the sea! (Storms off.)

Rachel: Look Joey, Iâm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.

Joey: Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"

Rachel: Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?

Joey: Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?

Rachel: Yeah, I didnât want you to get hit by the boom!

Joey: Well it hit me anyway! And it wouldâve hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.

Rachel: All right, yâknow what? I-Iâm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.

Joey: You wonât boss me around anymore?

Rachel: I wonât boss you around.

Joey: And youâll be nice?

Rachel: And, Iâll be nice.

Joey: And youâll be topless?

Rachel: AndâJoey!

Joey: Do you want me to learn?!

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is trying out different cookie recipes. Ross and Phoebe are the tasting group.]

Monica: Okay, hereâs batch 22. Ohh, maybe theseâll taste a little like your grandmotherâs. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.

Ross: Letâs give it a shot.

Monica: Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.

Phoebe: Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?

Monica: No, just a Friday night.

(They all take a bite.)

Ross: Ohh, these are pretty good.

Phoebe: Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.

Ross: Which one was that?

Monica: The ones we had right after you almost threw up.

Ross: Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. (Burps a little bit.) Iâm okay.

Phoebe: Are there anymore from the good batch? âCause we could just work off of those.

Ross: Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uhâ¦ (Grabs a cookie and takes a big bite out of it and doesnât like it.) Itâs batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way! (Gets up and runs for the bathroom.)

[Scene: The Mr. Bowmont, its Joeyâs second lesson with Rachel as the resident sailing expert.]

Rachel: Okay Joey honey, youâre doing really good! All right, now Iâm just gonna need you to step to the port side. (Joey pauses as he tries to remember which side is the port side.) Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?

Joey: Ohh yeah.

Rachel: Right?

Joey: Nope.

Rachel: Itâs left sweetie, but thatâs okay sweetie, thatâs a tough one.

Joey: I donât know why you just donât say left.

Rachel: Okay, go to the left. (Joey goes starboard or sits on the right side of the boat.) The left!

Joey: Huh?

Rachel: (yelling) Just sit over there!! (Points to the port side.)

Joey: (hurrying over) Okay! Okay, youâre yelling again! See that?

Rachel: No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.

Joey: Oh, yâknow what? Since Iâm here, I think Iâm gonna have me a little beer on the port side. (Grabs and opens one.)

Rachel: Okay Joey, weâre luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham? (The mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working efficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)

Joey: Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didnât know there.

Rachel: Joey, come on! We just went over this! (She does it instead.)

Joey: Oh, yâknow, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!

Rachel: (angrily) No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!

Joey: All right thatâs it! Youâre yelling and I donât see you taking your top off! I quit!

Rachel: What do you mean you quit?! You canât quit!

Joey: Why not?!

Rachel: Because youâre not finished yet and I wonât have it! Greens do not quit!

Joey: Greens? Iâm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!

Rachel: Oh my God, wait did IâI just said Greens donât quit didnât I? (Pause) (Angrily) Did I just say Greens donât quit?!

Joey: Yes! Yes! You did and youâre still yelling at me!

Rachel: No! No! No! Iâm not yelling at you, Iâm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh Iâm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! Iâve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this cominâ. Oh, Joey, Iâm sorry. Iâm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.

Joey: Well, hey I did learn.

Rachel: Really?

Joey: Yeah! Come on.

Rachel: Awwwâ¦

Joey: Yeah, itâs okay. I know what a mainsail is. (Points to it. Itâs the larger sail.) I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.

Rachel: Left.

Joey: Damnit!

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, the cookie trying period has pasted. Monica, Phoebe, and Ross are reflecting on the dayâs events.]

Phoebe: Yâknow, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that weâre trying to figure out her recipe. I bet sheâs l-l-lookinâ up at us and smiling right now.

Ross: Looking up?

Phoebe: Oh yeahâNo, she was really nice to me, but sheâs in hell for sure.

Monica: Well, Iâve tried everything. I give up. I guess Iâm not gonna be the mom who makes the worldâs best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right.

Ross: Aww, Pheeb, come on isnât there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?

Phoebe: Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And thatâs not happening âtil October 15th, 2032.

Ross: Thatâs the day youâre gonna die? Seeâdarnit, Iâve got shuffleboard that day.

Phoebe: Thatâs what you think.

Monica: Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmotherâs? Wouldnât they have the recipe?

Phoebe: Well, yâknow I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.

Monica: What was her name?

Phoebe: Nesele Toulouse.

Monica: Nestle Tollhouse?!

Phoebe: Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.

Monica: (grabbing a bag of Nestle Tollhouse chocolate chips) Phoebe, is this the recipe? (Tosses her the bag.)

Phoebe: (reading the recipe on the back of the bag) Yes!! (Realizes.) Ohh.

Monica: I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!

Phoebe: I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why (Looking down) youâre burning in hell!!

[Scene: The Gym, Chandler and Mr. Geller are heading for the whirlpool room.]

Chandler: So you understand, Iâd feel a lot more comfortable if you didnât tell people what happened. Yâknow, Iâm a littleâ¦Iâm a little embarrassed about it.

Mr. Geller: I understand completely, thereâs nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.

Chandler: What did you do when they found out?

Mr. Geller: They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?

(Chandler nods along and they enter the whirlpool room and remove their robes. Only Chandler is lacking a certain item of clothing. You see this is a coed whirlpool, which means swimsuits, and in fact there are two women already there and Chandler didnât seem to wear his. Needless to say, everyone is shocked, including Chandler.)

Chandler: So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!

Ending Credits

[Scene: The Mr. Bowmont, is tied up alongside the pier; Joey and Rachel are relaxing.]

Rachel: Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.

Joey: Yeah, yeah. Hey, why donât you give a pull on that rope? (Points.)

Rachel: Ohh weâre not sailing.

Joey: Just pull on it.

Rachel: All right. (She does so and it brings the cooler closer together.) Hey-hey-hey!! (Sees whatâs in the cooler.) Sandwiches!

Joey: What else?

Rachel: (hands him one) Here you go.

Joey: Thank you.

Rachel: Oh wow! (She takes a bite, but holds the sandwich vertically so that the stuff falls out.)

Joey: What are you doing?

Rachel: Ohh, sorry.

Joey: What youâdonât hold it like that! Youâre lettinâ all the good stuff fall out.

(More falls out.)

Rachel: Ohh whoops.

Joey: Careful! Youâre wasting good pastrami! (Gasps.) Oh my God! Iâm my dad!


[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel, Phoebe, Joey, Ross, and Monica are all there as Chandler enters wearing glasses.]

Chandler: Hey, you guys!

Ross and Rachel: Hey!

Chandler: So, what do you think?

Ross: About what?

Rachel: Yeah, what?

Joey: What?

Chandler: Are you kidding? Okay, Iâll give you a hint; Iâll give you a hint. (Points to his glasses.)

Joey: Eyes! No, no. Your eyes! No. Chandlerâs eyes!

Chandler: I got glasses!

Ross: Well, you-youâve always had glasses.

Chandler: No I didnât!

Ross: Are you sure?

Rachel: Yeah-yeah, did-didnât you use to have a pair? They were really round, burgundy, and they made you look kind of ummâ¦

Joey: Feminine.

Rachel: Yes!

Chandler: No!

Monica: Sweetie, I think the glasses look great. They make you look really sexy.

Chandler: Really?

Monica: Yeah!

Chandler: (sitting down on the arm of her chair) You didnât think I used to wear glasses, right?

Monica: Of course! (She mouths, "I have no idea," to the rest of the gang.)

Opening Credits

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Rachel, Phoebe, Chandler, and Monica are making some sandwiches.]

Phoebe: So what do you guys want for an engagement present?

Chandler: Thatâs okay Pheebs, weâre not having a party or anything, so you donât have to get usâ¦

Monica: (interrupts him) If someone wants to give us a present, we donât want to deprive them of that joy.

Rachel: Oh, yâknow what you should get âem? One of those little uh, portable CD players.

Monica: Oh, I already have one.

Phoebe: Not unless someone borrowed it and left it at the gynecologist.

Rachel: Yeah, and-and-and by someone, she means Joey.

Monica: Hey, I know I what I want!

Chandler: What we want honey.

Monica: No, you donât want this. I want to have your grandmotherâs cookie recipe.

Phoebe: You mean the chocolate chip cookie recipe?

Monica: Uh-huh, yeah.

Phoebe: You mean the one that my grandmother made me swear on her deathbed that I would never let out of our family?

Chandler: Dying people say the craziest things.

Monica: I wanted it for years! I was gonna make cookies for my children.

Phoebe: Break my heartâOh, all right.

Monica: Okay. Iâm gonna be the mom that makes the worldâs best chocolate chip cookies.

Chandler: Our kids are gonna be fat arenât they.

Joey: (entering) Ahoy!

Chandler: Hey! Howâs the boat?!

Joey: Great! Iâm finally getting into this sailing stuff.

Monica: Oh, so you finally took it out of the marina huh?

Joey: Why would I do that? It took three guys to get the thing in there!

Phoebe: If you donât sail your boat, what do you do on it?

Joey: Oh, itâs great! Itâs a great place to just kinda, sit, hang around, drink a few beers, eat some chips. (He says that as he sits, hangs around, drinks a beer, and eats a chip.)

Chandler: Well, itâs good that you finally have a place to do that.

Rachel: Yâknow Joey, I could teach you to sail if you want.

Joey: You could?

Rachel: Yeah! Iâve been sailing my whole life. When I was fifteen my dad bought me my own boat.

Phoebe: Your own boat?

Rachel: What?! What?! He was trying to cheer me up! My pony was sick.

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler and Monica are there. He takes off his glasses and starts chewing on the ear piece.]

Chandler: Do you know what I was thinkinâ?

Monica: What?

Chandler: Nothing, I just like to go like this. (Does it again.)

Ross: (entering from the bathrooms) Hey Chandler, what are you doing tonight?

Chandler: Uh why, do you have a lecture?

Ross: No, why?

Chandler: Then free as a bird. Whatâs up?

Ross: My dad wanted to know if you wanted to play racquetball with us.

Monica: Wow! Thatâs great! Dad must really like you, he doesnât ask just anyone to play.

Ross: Yeah and he didnât really ask for you, he asked for Chancy, I assumed he meant you.

Chandler: Well, did-did you correct him?

Ross: No, I-I thought it would be more fun this way.

Monica: This is so cool, maybe this is something you can do every week.

Ross: Or you can sit with him on the front porch and make sure no one steals the trash cans. He does that every week too.

Monica: Oh, just so you know, you-you have to let him win.

Ross: Yeah.

Monica: He hates to lose.

Chandler: Oh no problem, maybe Iâll play with my left hand.

Ross: Youâre not a lefty?

Chandler: Does anybody know me?!

(Phoebe enters, walks up to Monica, and exhales exasperatedly.)

Monica: Whatâs wrong Phoebe?

Phoebe: I just went to my old apartment to get you the-the cookie recipe and the stupid fire burned it up!

Monica: No!! Why didnât you make a copy and-and keep it in a fireproof box and keep it at least a hundred yards from the original?!!

Phoebe: (pauses as he figures out how to answer that) Because Iâm normal! That was the one legacy my grandmother left me, and I know you wanted it as an engagement present.

Ross: Oh, we have to get you an engagement present?

Chandler: Donât worry about it Pheebs.

Ross: No one got me an engagement present.

Phoebe: Okay, here I wish you health and happiness. (She hands Monica a cookie in a plastic baggie.)

Chandler: An old cookie?

Monica: (To Chandler) This is what happens when you donât register for gifts!

Phoebe: See no-no, I made a batch and I froze it, and this is the only one left.

Chandler: We canât accept this.

Phoebe: Why not?

Chandler: âCause itâs gross.

Monica: No! Wait! I think I can figure out the recipe from this cookie! I do stuff like this at work all the time.

Phoebe: Really?!

Monica: Yeah! I bet I can do it.

(Chandler looks over and sees Ross glaring at them.)

Chandler: Okay, we owe you a present.

Ross: Two! Iâve been engaged twice!

[Scene: The Mr. Bowmont (Joeyâs boat), sheâs shown to be in one of the waterways around New York, but in reality sheâs in a sound stage on the Warner Bros. lot and we see New York from the water in some rather poor green screen shots. Rachel and Joey are on board.]

Joey: (drinking a beer) Look at this clown! Just because heâs got a bigger boat he thinks he can take up the whole river. (Yelling) Get out of the way jackass! (To Rachel) Who names his boat Coast Guard anyway?

Rachel: That is the Coast Guard.

Joey: What are they doing out here? The coastâs all the way over there. (Points to the coast, meanwhile there is coast behind him.)

Rachel: Joey, just ignore the boats all right? Weâre not finished with the lesson yet.

Joey: All right.

Rachel: Okay, Iâm just gonna go over the basic points just one more time, are you ready?

Joey: Come on Rach, not again. I got it! Okay? Letâs start sailing, and I want to go over there (Points) where that boatload of girls is! (Yelling to them) Yo-ho-ho!

Rachel: Oh, okay. Is that what you want to do? You wanna go over and give a little shout out to the old, hot chickas? Okay, letâs do that Sailor Joe. Quick question though, (grabs some of the rigging) whatâs this called?

Joey: Uh, boat rope.

Rachel: Wrong! How do you get the mainsail up?

Joey: Uhh, rub it?

Rachel: No. What do you do if I say we are coming about?

Joey: Iâd say, come again. No-no, wait I-I-I know this one, I know this one, uhâ¦

(Rachel blasts an air horn in his ear.)

Rachel: Timeâs up, now your dead.

Joey: And deaf!

Rachel: Okay, you just go on and make your little jokey-jokes, but if you do not know what you are doing out at sea you will die at sea. Am I getting through to you sailor?! (She punctuates each word by slapping him on the forehead.)

Joey: Yes.

Rachel: Donât just say yes! This isnât a game, Joey you can really get hurt out here. Okay, so do you want to pay attention or do you want to die?!

Joey: I want to make a ship to shore call to Chandler.

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica and Phoebe are trying to determine the cookie recipe by eating small pieces.]

Monica: All right, I definitely taste nutmeg.

Phoebe: You do?

Monica: You donât? (Laughs) Well, thatâs the difference between a professional and a layman.

Phoebe: That and arrogance.

Joey: (entering) Hey.

Monica: Hey! How was sailing?

Joey: I donât want to talk about it. Yâknow, you couldâve at least saved me a whole cookie. (He grabs whatâs left of the cookie and pops in his mouth.)

Monica and Phoebe: No-wait-no-no!!!!!!!

Joey: (recoils in horror) Women are mean!!! (Storms out.)

Phoebe: I canât believe that! Now the only thing left of my grandmotherâs legacy is this crumb. (She picks it up with her finger and holds it out to Monica.) I wish you a long and happy marriage.

Ross: (entering with Chandler) Hey.

Monica: Hey! How was it?

Ross: Well I had a great time! Umm, Chancy on the other handâ¦

Chandler: I will tell the story! It was going great. I let him win. We were bonding. He even said I could call him dad.

Ross: And what did he ask you not to call him?

Chandler: Daddy. All right look, hereâs the story. (Flashback to Chandler about to enter the steam room as he does the voice-over.) Well, we had just finished playing racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. I walk into the steam room and it was really steamy. (The flashback shows his glasses fog up and him trying to find his way around the steam filled room. He takes off his glasses.) So I take off my glasses and thatâs when in happened.

[Cut to the flashback, Chandlerâs no longer doing the voice-over.]

Chandler: Guys?

Ross: Over here. (You can see Ross sitting at the far wall.)

Mr. Geller: Have a seat son. (You can see Mr. Geller sitting closer to the door as Chandler walks over and sits in his lap.) Hey!! (Chandler quickly jumps off and sits next to him with a shocked expression on his face.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is finished telling everyone what happened.]

Monica: Oh my God Chandler! I canât believe it!

Chandler: I know.

Monica: You gave my father a lap dance!

Chandler: Why do they put so much steam in there?!

Ross: âCause otherwise theyâd have to call it the room room.

Chandler: Why? Okay? Why? Wh-wh-why did that have to happen?

Phoebe: Come on, itâs not that big a deal!

Chandler: Not that big a deal? Thereâ¦there was touching of things.

Ross: Now, I know you wanted to bond with my dad, but did you really have to bond to that part?

Monica: Listen, Iâm sure that dad doesnât care. He probably thought this was funny; heâll be telling this story for years!

Chandler: I donât want him to tell this story for years.

Ross: Oh, but he will. He still tells the story how Monica tried to escape from fat camp.

Monica: I wasnât escaping.

Ross: Then how did you get caught in the barbed wire?

Monica: I was trying to help out a squirrel.

Ross: You were trying to eat it!

(The phone rings.)

Chandler: If that is your father calling to tell this story then the marriage is off!

Monica: (takes the phone from Ross) Come on. (Answering phone) Hello? (Listens) Iâm sorry you have the wrong number. (Listens) (Whispering) Okay, Iâll call you later dad. I love you. (Hangs up.)

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler, Ross, and Rachel are there.]

Chandler: (getting up) All right, Iâm off to see your dad.

Ross: Whoa-whoa, arenât you a little over dressed?

Rachel: (laughing) Yeah, and-and you better make sure he tips you this time.

Chandler: Look, I figured I would try to convince him not to tell the story anymore, and I figure the best way to do that is face to faceâAnd by face I donât mean his lap. And by face, I donât mean my ass. (Exits.)

Ross: (To Rachel) Hey are you getting Monica and Chandler an engagement present?

Rachel: I donât know. Yâknow, they didnât get us anything.

Ross: Thank you!

Joey: (entering) Hey.

Ross: Hey.

Rachel: Well hello! So, when are we gettinâ back out on the water matey?

Joey: Oh uh, I donât know the boat way to say this, but uh never!

Rachel: Why not?

Joey: Because! Youâre mean on the boat!

Rachel: What? I was just trying to teach you.

Joey: Well, lesson learned! Rachel is mean!

Ross: Yeeeeeepâ¦ Yep-yep-yep-yep-yep. I remember when she took out on her dadâs boat she wouldnât let me help at all.

Rachel: Excuse me, I wanted you to help, but you couldnât move your arms because you were wearing three life jackets.

Ross: You have to respect the sea! (Storms off.)

Rachel: Look Joey, Iâm sorry if-if you thought that was mean, but I gotta tell ya something. That was not mean. Okay, my father is mean. He used to yell at me all the time on the boat, I mean it was horrible. I was just being a good teacher.

Joey: Does a good teacher say, "Put down the beer pinhead!?"

Rachel: Well, does a good student drink seven beers during his first lesson?

Joey: Six and a half! You knocked that last one out of my hand! Remember?

Rachel: Yeah, I didnât want you to get hit by the boom!

Joey: Well it hit me anyway! And it wouldâve hurt a lot less if I had finished that last beer.

Rachel: All right, yâknow what? I-Iâm sorry. I will try to tone it down and uh stop yelling.

Joey: You wonât boss me around anymore?

Rachel: I wonât boss you around.

Joey: And youâll be nice?

Rachel: And, Iâll be nice.

Joey: And youâll be topless?

Rachel: AndâJoey!

Joey: Do you want me to learn?!

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is trying out different cookie recipes. Ross and Phoebe are the tasting group.]

Monica: Okay, hereâs batch 22. Ohh, maybe theseâll taste a little like your grandmotherâs. This has a little bit of orange peel, but no nutmeg.

Ross: Letâs give it a shot.

Monica: Okay. Man, I have not made this many cookies since I was in the ninth grade.

Phoebe: Oh, what was that for? Like a bake sale?

Monica: No, just a Friday night.

(They all take a bite.)

Ross: Ohh, these are pretty good.

Phoebe: Yeah, but not as good as batch 17.

Ross: Which one was that?

Monica: The ones we had right after you almost threw up.

Ross: Oh yeah! Batch 17 was good. I did not like batch 16. (Burps a little bit.) Iâm okay.

Phoebe: Are there anymore from the good batch? âCause we could just work off of those.

Ross: Yeah, ooh yeah, I think there is one from batch 17 left, uhâ¦ (Grabs a cookie and takes a big bite out of it and doesnât like it.) Itâs batch 16! 16 people! Get out of the way! (Gets up and runs for the bathroom.)

[Scene: The Mr. Bowmont, its Joeyâs second lesson with Rachel as the resident sailing expert.]

Rachel: Okay Joey honey, youâre doing really good! All right, now Iâm just gonna need you to step to the port side. (Joey pauses as he tries to remember which side is the port side.) Remember? Remember how we talked about the port side?

Joey: Ohh yeah.

Rachel: Right?

Joey: Nope.

Rachel: Itâs left sweetie, but thatâs okay sweetie, thatâs a tough one.

Joey: I donât know why you just donât say left.

Rachel: Okay, go to the left. (Joey goes starboard or sits on the right side of the boat.) The left!

Joey: Huh?

Rachel: (yelling) Just sit over there!! (Points to the port side.)

Joey: (hurrying over) Okay! Okay, youâre yelling again! See that?

Rachel: No! No-no, no-no-no, very quiet, said with love, no yelling.

Joey: Oh, yâknow what? Since Iâm here, I think Iâm gonna have me a little beer on the port side. (Grabs and opens one.)

Rachel: Okay Joey, weâre luffing a little bit, so could you tighten up the cunningham? (The mainsail has started to flap in the wind and has stopped working efficiently; she wants him to tighten it so that it starts working again.)

Joey: Uh, wow, you just said a bunch of stuff I didnât know there.

Rachel: Joey, come on! We just went over this! (She does it instead.)

Joey: Oh, yâknow, when we did that was when that bird was flying overhead with the fish in his mouth. Did you see it? It was gross!

Rachel: (angrily) No! All right?! I did not see the bird! I did not see the fish! I did not see the piece of Styrofoam that was shaped like Mike Tyson! I did not, because I was trying to teach you how to sail a boat! Which obviously is an impossible thing to do!

Joey: All right thatâs it! Youâre yelling and I donât see you taking your top off! I quit!

Rachel: What do you mean you quit?! You canât quit!

Joey: Why not?!

Rachel: Because youâre not finished yet and I wonât have it! Greens do not quit!

Joey: Greens? Iâm a Tribbiani! And Tribbianis quit!

Rachel: Oh my God, wait did IâI just said Greens donât quit didnât I? (Pause) (Angrily) Did I just say Greens donât quit?!

Joey: Yes! Yes! You did and youâre still yelling at me!

Rachel: No! No! No! Iâm not yelling at you, Iâm just yelling near you. Oh God Joey, ohh Iâm my father. Oh my God, this is horrible! Iâve been trying so hard not to be my mother I did not see this cominâ. Oh, Joey, Iâm sorry. Iâm so sorry. I just wanted you to learn.

Joey: Well, hey I did learn.

Rachel: Really?

Joey: Yeah! Come on.

Rachel: Awwwâ¦

Joey: Yeah, itâs okay. I know what a mainsail is. (Points to it. Itâs the larger sail.) I know, I know to duck when the boom comes across. I-I know port is right.

Rachel: Left.

Joey: Damnit!

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, the cookie trying period has pasted. Monica, Phoebe, and Ross are reflecting on the dayâs events.]

Phoebe: Yâknow, I bet it would actually make my grandmother very happy to know that weâre trying to figure out her recipe. I bet sheâs l-l-lookinâ up at us and smiling right now.

Ross: Looking up?

Phoebe: Oh yeahâNo, she was really nice to me, but sheâs in hell for sure.

Monica: Well, Iâve tried everything. I give up. I guess Iâm not gonna be the mom who makes the worldâs best chocolate cookies. I do make the best duck confit with broccoli rabe.  Kids love that right.

Ross: Aww, Pheeb, come on isnât there any relative that would have the recipe? What about, what about your sister?

Phoebe: Oh no-no, no, I made a promise to myself that the next time I would talk to Ursula would be over my dead body. And thatâs not happening âtil October 15th, 2032.

Ross: Thatâs the day youâre gonna die? Seeâdarnit, Iâve got shuffleboard that day.

Phoebe: Thatâs what you think.

Monica: Well, I mean what about friends of your grandmotherâs? Wouldnât they have the recipe?

Phoebe: Well, yâknow I may have relatives in France who would know. My grandmother said she got the recipe from her grandmother, Nesele Tolouse.

Monica: What was her name?

Phoebe: Nesele Toulouse.

Monica: Nestle Tollhouse?!

Phoebe: Oh, you Americans always butcher the French language.

Monica: (grabbing a bag of Nestle Tollhouse chocolate chips) Phoebe, is this the recipe? (Tosses her the bag.)

Phoebe: (reading the recipe on the back of the bag) Yes!! (Realizes.) Ohh.

Monica: I cannot believe that I just spent the last two days trying to figure out the recipe and it was in my cupboard the whole time!

Phoebe: I know! You see it is stuff like this which is why (Looking down) youâre burning in hell!!

[Scene: The Gym, Chandler and Mr. Geller are heading for the whirlpool room.]

Chandler: So you understand, Iâd feel a lot more comfortable if you didnât tell people what happened. Yâknow, Iâm a littleâ¦Iâm a little embarrassed about it.

Mr. Geller: I understand completely, thereâs nothing more horrifying than embarrassing yourself in front of your in-laws. As a matter of fact, when I started dating Judy I was unemployed, and her father asked me what I did for a living and I told him I was a lawyer.

Chandler: What did you do when they found out?

Mr. Geller: They never did, so if ever see me giving them legal advice just nod along. Shall we?

(Chandler nods along and they enter the whirlpool room and remove their robes. Only Chandler is lacking a certain item of clothing. You see this is a coed whirlpool, which means swimsuits, and in fact there are two women already there and Chandler didnât seem to wear his. Needless to say, everyone is shocked, including Chandler.)

Chandler: So I guess we wear swimsuits in here!

Ending Credits

[Scene: The Mr. Bowmont, is tied up alongside the pier; Joey and Rachel are relaxing.]

Rachel: Well Joey, I hate to admit it, your way of sailing is a lot more fun.

Joey: Yeah, yeah. Hey, why donât you give a pull on that rope? (Points.)

Rachel: Ohh weâre not sailing.

Joey: Just pull on it.

Rachel: All right. (She does so and it brings the cooler closer together.) Hey-hey-hey!! (Sees whatâs in the cooler.) Sandwiches!

Joey: What else?

Rachel: (hands him one) Here you go.

Joey: Thank you.

Rachel: Oh wow! (She takes a bite, but holds the sandwich vertically so that the stuff falls out.)

Joey: What are you doing?

Rachel: Ohh, sorry.

Joey: What youâdonât hold it like that! Youâre lettinâ all the good stuff fall out.

(More falls out.)

Rachel: Ohh whoops.

Joey: Careful! Youâre wasting good pastrami! (Gasps.) Oh my God! Iâm my dad!


[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, everyone is there and they are finishing watching the first episode of Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E. Joey is of course Mac.]

Hilda: What?

Rachel: Iâve never interviewed anyone before. Iâve actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isnât the same thing.

Rachel: No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.

Man: Tag Jones.

Rachel: Uh-huh, go on.

Tag: Thatâs it. Thatâs my whole name.

Rachel: Thatâs your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well letâs-letâs just have a look-see here. (Looking at his resume)

Tag: I know I havenât worked in an office before, and I really donât have a lot of experience, but uhâ¦

Rachel: Oh come on, what are you talking about? Youâve got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Fridayâs, come on!

Tag: Itâs lame, I know. But Iâm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learnâ¦

Rachel: Okay, hold on just a second. (She grabs a camera out of the desk and takes his picture.) Iâm sorry, itâs for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is sitting on the couch when some unknown guy comes in and sits in their easy chair.]

Phoebe: (To Monica) Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.

Monica: (To Chandler) Hey sweetie.

Chandler: Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?

Monica: I canât tell you. Itâs a secret.

Chandler: Secret? Married people arenât supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.

Monica: Awww. (Kisses him.) But still no.

Chandler: No Iâm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.

Monica: Really? Okay, so why donât you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?

Chandler: Oh no-no, I canât do that.

Monica: If you tell me, Iâll tell you what Phoebe said.

Chandler: Okay.

Monica: Okay.

Chandler: So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, weâre on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.

Monica: Oh my God. He threw up?

Rachel: No, I-I just donât know how you decide who to hire. I mean Iâve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then thereâs this guyâ¦

Chandler: What about him?

Rachel: I love him. Heâs so pretty I wanna cry! I donât know what to do. Tell me what to do.

Phoebe: Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You donât hire an assistant because theyâre cute, you hire them because theyâre qualified.

Rachel: Uh-huh. No, I hear what youâre saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty!

Phoebe: Letâs see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Ohâ¦ But no! No! You canât-you canât hire him, because thatâitâs not professional. Umm, this is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.)

Rachel: Okay youâre right. Iâll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!

Hilda: What?

Rachel: Iâve never interviewed anyone before. Iâve actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isnât the same thing.

Tag: Thatâs it. Thatâs my whole name.

Rachel: Thatâs your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well letâs-letâs just have a look-see here. (Looking at his resume)

Tag: I know I havenât worked in an office before, and I really donât have a lot of experience, but uhâ¦

Rachel: Oh come on, what are you talking about? Youâve got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Fridayâs, come on!

Tag: Itâs lame, I know. But Iâm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learnâ¦

Phoebe: (To Monica) Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.

Monica: (To Chandler) Hey sweetie.

Chandler: Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?

Monica: I canât tell you. Itâs a secret.

Chandler: Secret? Married people arenât supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.

Monica: Awww. (Kisses him.) But still no.

Chandler: No Iâm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.

Monica: Really? Okay, so why donât you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?

Chandler: Oh no-no, I canât do that.

Monica: If you tell me, Iâll tell you what Phoebe said.

Chandler: Okay.

Monica: Okay.

Chandler: So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, weâre on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.

Monica: Oh my God. He threw up?

Chandler: No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs hysterically.) So what was Phoebeâs secret?

Monica: Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebeâs old massage place is getting fired.

Rachel: No, I-I just donât know how you decide who to hire. I mean Iâve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then thereâs this guyâ¦

Chandler: What about him?

Rachel: I love him. Heâs so pretty I wanna cry! I donât know what to do. Tell me what to do.

Phoebe: Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You donât hire an assistant because theyâre cute, you hire them because theyâre qualified.

Rachel: Uh-huh. No, I hear what youâre saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty!

Phoebe: Letâs see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Ohâ¦ But no! No! You canât-you canât hire him, because thatâitâs not professional. Umm, this is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.)

Rachel: Okay youâre right. Iâll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!

Rachel: (reading the resume) And you were at this job for four years?

Hilda: Thatâs right.

Rachel: Okay, well this is all very impressive Hilda, um I just have one last question for you. Uh, how did I do? Was this okay?

Hilda: What?

Rachel: Iâve never interviewed anyone before. Iâve actually never had anyone work for me before. Although when I was a kid, we did have a maid, but this is-this isnât the same thing.

Hilda: No dear. Itâs not.

Rachel: No. Yeah, and I know that. All right, well thank you so much for coming in it was nice to meet you.

Man: Actually, Iâm here about the assistant job.

Rachel: Really?! (Taking his resume) Okay well then, all right, well just have a seat there. Umm, so whatâsâwhat isâwhatâs your name?

Man: Tag Jones.

Rachel: Uh-huh, go on.

Tag: Thatâs it. Thatâs my whole name.

Rachel: Thatâs your whole name, okay of course it is! Okay, well letâs-letâs just have a look-see here. (Looking at his resume)

Tag: I know I havenât worked in an office before, and I really donât have a lot of experience, but uhâ¦

Rachel: Oh come on, what are you talking about? Youâve got three years painting houses. Two whole summers at T.G.I. Fridayâs, come on!

Tag: Itâs lame, I know. But Iâm a goal-oriented person, very eager to learnâ¦

Rachel: Okay, hold on just a second. (She grabs a camera out of the desk and takes his picture.) Iâm sorry, itâs for human resources, everybody has to do it. Could you just stand up please?

[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is sitting on the couch when some unknown guy comes in and sits in their easy chair.]

Phoebe: (To Monica) Anyway, I should go. Okay, bye.

Monica: (To Chandler) Hey sweetie.

Chandler: Hi sweetie. So, what was with all the whispering?

Monica: I canât tell you. Itâs a secret.

Chandler: Secret? Married people arenât supposed to have secrets between one another. We have too much love and respect for one another.

Monica: Awww. (Kisses him.) But still no.

Chandler: No Iâm serious, we should tell each other everything. I do not have any secrets from you.

Monica: Really? Okay, so why donât you tell me what happened to Ross Junior year at Disneyland?

Chandler: Oh no-no, I canât do that.

Monica: If you tell me, Iâll tell you what Phoebe said.

Chandler: Okay.

Monica: Okay.

Chandler: So, Ross and I are going to Disneyland and we stop at this restaurant for tacos. And when I say restaurant, I mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk of his car. So Ross has about 10 tacos. And anyway, weâre on Space Mountain and Ross starts to feel a little iffy.

Monica: Oh my God. He threw up?

Chandler: No, he visited a little town south of throw up. (Monica laughs hysterically.) So what was Phoebeâs secret?

Monica: Oh, Nancy Thompson from Phoebeâs old massage place is getting fired.

Chandler: Thatâs it?! I gave up my Disneyland story for that?

Monica: Thatâs right! You lose sucker!! (Pause) Please still marry me.

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler, Rachel, and Phoebe are there.]

Rachel: Chandler, you have an assistant right?

Chandler: (angrily) Did she call? You-you told her I was sick right? Always tell her I am sick!

Rachel: No, I-I just donât know how you decide who to hire. I mean Iâve got it narrowed down to two people. One of them has great references and a lot of experience and then thereâs this guyâ¦

Chandler: What about him?

Rachel: I love him. Heâs so pretty I wanna cry! I donât know what to do. Tell me what to do.

Phoebe: Come on you know what to do! You hire the first one! You donât hire an assistant because theyâre cute, you hire them because theyâre qualified.

Rachel: Uh-huh. No, I hear what youâre saying and-and-and that makes a lot of sense but can I just say one more thing? (Takes out his picture.) Look how pretty!

Phoebe: Letâs see. (Looking at the picture) Oh my God! Ohâ¦ But no! No! You canât-you canât hire him, because thatâitâs not professional. Umm, this is for me (The picture) yes? Thanks. (Puts it in her pocket.)

Rachel: Okay youâre right. Iâll hire Hilda tomorrow. Dumb old perfect for the job Hilda!

Chandler: Let me see this guy. (Phoebe hands him the picture.) W-H-Wow! Donât show this to Monica! And donât tell her about the W-H-Wow!

Monica: Excuse me Mr. Mexico.

Ross: Eh, either way Iâll pass. (Quietly to Chandler) I still canât eat those. (Monica is getting something out of the fridge and starts laughing.) Whatâs so funny?!

Chandler: I do? (He smiles, beautifully.)

Monica: Yeah! (They turn to the camera, and Chandler does The Face again.) All right, maybe you donât have to smile. Letâs try something else. Letâs try umm, try looking sexy.

Rachel: How would you feel about taking out my assistant Tag? Iâll pay.

Joey: Huh, Rach I got to say itâs gonna take a lot of money for me to go out on a date with a dude.

Rachel: Iâm not asking you to go on a date with him!

Joey: Really? âCause I could kinda use the money.

Rachel: Joey, just-just he-heâs new in town and I know he doesnât have any guy friends. Just take him to like a ball game or something. Iâll really appreciate it.

Joey: Yeah, okay.

Rachel: Yeah?

Joey: Sure, no problem. (Sees something.) OohâHey, donuts!

Chandler! What is the matter with your face?! I mean this picture is supposed to say "Geller and Bing to be married," not "Local woman saves drowning moron!" (The photographer laughs.) Hey! Donât laugh at him! Heâs my drowning moron!

Whitney: Sure.

Ross: Okay. (Closes the door.) (To Phoebe) I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?

Phoebe: Watching ballroom dancing?

Ross: Yes! Thatâs where we realized we were both super cool people!

Phoebe: Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.

Ross: Like what?

Phoebe: Like sheâs really mean, and sheâs over critical, and-andâNo! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!

Ross: Okay.

Phoebe: And! She uses sex as a weapon!

Ross: Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast Iâll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.

Phoebe: Youâre still gonna go out with her?!

Ross: Yeah!

Phoebe: Well, didnât you just hear what I said?!

Ross: Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husbandâs gonna say that stuff. Now, if youâll excuse meâ¦

Rachel: Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.

Joey: What?

Rachel: Yâknow, all the women.

Joey: Hey well, you canât teach someone to be good with women. Yâknow, thatâs why I never had any luck with Chandler.

Chandler: (Pause) Iâm right here!

Rachel: All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, itâs justâAnd I know heâs my assistant and I canât date himâbut it just bothers me, all right?!

Joey: Hey! No-no-no-no, you canât take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!

Chandler: Iâm still right here!

Rachel: All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!

Joey: (shocked) What?!

Rachel: I just donât want him to meet anybody until I am over my crushâAnd I will get over it. Itâs-itâs not like I love him, itâs just physical! ButâI mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!

Rachel: (To Joey) So, will you talk to him?

Ross: Listen, you are hearing one side of the story, okayâand F.Y.I she mustâve shown Kyle over 30 paint samples before she painted that room! And his response to each one was, "I donât give a tiny ratâs ass."

Phoebe: Yeah well, maybe she shouldâve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.

Ross: Well, I donât think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe thatâs just because I am not emotionally unavailable!

Phoebe: You think heâs emotionally unavailable?

Ross: I think he can be.

Phoebe: Well, maybe he wouldnât be she didnât bring the office home every night!

Whitney: Well, I went over to Kyleâs last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscingâ¦

Kyle: â¦we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. Soâ¦ (Pause)

Whitney: Sure.

Ross: Okay. (Closes the door.) (To Phoebe) I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?

Phoebe: Watching ballroom dancing?

Ross: Yes! Thatâs where we realized we were both super cool people!

Phoebe: Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.

Ross: Like what?

Phoebe: Like sheâs really mean, and sheâs over critical, and-andâNo! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!

Ross: Okay.

Phoebe: And! She uses sex as a weapon!

Ross: Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast Iâll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.

Phoebe: Youâre still gonna go out with her?!

Ross: Yeah!

Phoebe: Well, didnât you just hear what I said?!

Ross: Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husbandâs gonna say that stuff. Now, if youâll excuse meâ¦

Joey: What?

Rachel: Yâknow, all the women.

Joey: Hey well, you canât teach someone to be good with women. Yâknow, thatâs why I never had any luck with Chandler.

Chandler: (Pause) Iâm right here!

Rachel: All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, itâs justâAnd I know heâs my assistant and I canât date himâbut it just bothers me, all right?!

Joey: Hey! No-no-no-no, you canât take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!

Chandler: Iâm still right here!

Rachel: All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!

Joey: (shocked) What?!

Rachel: I just donât want him to meet anybody until I am over my crushâAnd I will get over it. Itâs-itâs not like I love him, itâs just physical! ButâI mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!

Phoebe: Yeah well, maybe she shouldâve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.

Ross: Well, I donât think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe thatâs just because I am not emotionally unavailable!

Phoebe: You think heâs emotionally unavailable?

Ross: I think he can be.

Phoebe: Well, maybe he wouldnât be she didnât bring the office home every night!

Whitney: Well, I went over to Kyleâs last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscingâ¦

Kyle: â¦we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. Soâ¦ (Pause)

Phoebe: Okay, donât freak out. Iâll go.

Hums While He Pees: No itâsâ¦ Uh, my ex-wife Whitney is out there. I cannot deal with her right now. That woman is crazy!

Ross: Yeah?

Phoebe: Yeah, umm thatâs Whitney (Points), Kyleâs ex-wife out there, now do you think that you can yâknow divert her so that we can slip out?

Ross: What?! No!

Phoebe: Well okay but I have two tickets to the ballroom dance finals. (She holds up the tickets that Kyle gave her.)

Ross: (opens the door and to Whitney) Hi! Iâm sorry, but can you give me a second while I talk to this woman, who by the way did not spend the night.

Whitney: Sure.

Ross: Okay. (Closes the door.) (To Phoebe) I did divert her and we ended up having a great time! Okay?

Phoebe: Watching ballroom dancing?

Ross: Yes! Thatâs where we realized we were both super cool people!

Phoebe: Well look-look, okay Ross, Kyle just told me some really bad stuff about her.

Ross: Like what?

Phoebe: Like sheâs really mean, and sheâs over critical, and-andâNo! She will paint a room a really bright color without even checking with you!

Ross: Okay.

Phoebe: And! She uses sex as a weapon!

Ross: Fine! Thank you for warning me. At breakfast Iâll be on full alert for room painting and sex weapons.

Phoebe: Youâre still gonna go out with her?!

Ross: Yeah!

Phoebe: Well, didnât you just hear what I said?!

Ross: Pheebs come on! I mean, consider the source! Of course her ex-husbandâs gonna say that stuff. Now, if youâll excuse meâ¦

Rachel: Yeah and you had fun teaching him how to be all Joey.

Joey: What?

Rachel: Yâknow, all the women.

Joey: Hey well, you canât teach someone to be good with women. Yâknow, thatâs why I never had any luck with Chandler.

Chandler: (Pause) Iâm right here!

Rachel: All right, would-would you mind just not going out with him again? Okay, just the idea of you and he and all these women, itâs justâAnd I know heâs my assistant and I canât date himâbut it just bothers me, all right?!

Joey: Hey! No-no-no-no, you canât take him away from me! I got a great partner to pick up girls with! Finally!!

Chandler: Iâm still right here!

Rachel: All right, will you, will you at least tell him how hollow and unsatisfying this, dating tons of women thing is!

Joey: (shocked) What?!

Rachel: I just donât want him to meet anybody until I am over my crushâAnd I will get over it. Itâs-itâs not like I love him, itâs just physical! ButâI mean I get crushes like this all the time! I mean hell, I had a crush on you when I first met ya!

Joey: I know, Monica told me.

Phoebe: Yeah well, maybe she shouldâve spent a little less time decorating and a little more time in the bedroom.

Ross: Well, I donât think we are gonna have that problem, but maybe thatâs just because I am not emotionally unavailable!

Phoebe: You think heâs emotionally unavailable?

Ross: I think he can be.

Phoebe: Well, maybe he wouldnât be she didnât bring the office home every night!

Ross: So do we!! So do we!! (Ross notices a couple has been staring at them.) Iâm sorry you had to see that.

[Scene: Rachelâs Office, Tag is entering.]

Tag: Good morning Rachel.

Rachel: Hi! (He hands her, her mail) Thanks, hey so uh whatâd you do last night?

Tag: Went out with Joey.

Rachel: Oh yeah? Another night of birdogging the chickas?

Tag: No. We had a really good talk. I donât think Iâm gonna do that bar scene anymore.

Rachel: Wow! I did not see that coming.

Tag: Itâs just not really who I am. Y'know, Iâve always been happier whenâ¦Why am I telling you this? You donât care about this stuff.

Whitney: Well, I went over to Kyleâs last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscingâ¦

Ross: Oh just say it Kyle!

Kyle: Weâre gonna give it another try.

Phoebe: What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!

Whitney: Iâm gonna work on that.

End
[Scene: A Restaurant, Phoebe, Rachel, and Monica are having brunch.]

Phoebe: I hope itâs you.

Phoebe: Yes!!! Oh!!

Rachel: Hypothetically!

Phoebe: Still.

Monica: If Phoebe were my maid of honorâ¦

Rachel: Uh-hmm.

Monica: Rachel would be Phoebeâs, I would be Rachelâs, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.

Rachel: Yeah thatâs actually a pretty good idea.

Phoebe: Yeah, Iâll do that. So who gets to be yours?

Monica: (laughs) Well thatâs the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!

Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing (A woman at the table behind them overhears Chandlerâs name and starts listening closer), my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people thatâ¦

Rachel: Iâm gonna marry someone good yâknow.

Phoebe: Oh I know.

Rachel: Better than Chandler. (Phoebe exhales as if to say, "Like what isnât?")

[Scene: Ross's apartment, Die Hard has ended, only I donât think Joey and Ross know that yet. As you see, they are both asleep. And theyâre on the same couch. Which means theyâre sleeping together. Not like Joey is at one end and Ross is on the other, they both happen to be lying down and sleeping together. Well, there hasnât been any clothes removed so not that kind of sleeping together. Not that thereâs anything wrong with that. That is unless youâre a Republican in which that kind of thing will bring about the downfall of Western society, especially if they should happen to want to get married. Anyway, let me recap. No, there is too much, let me sum up. Ross and Joey are taking a nap together on top of each other and both wake-up at the same time, realize what they just did, scream, and jump up.]

Ross: What happened?!!

Joey: Well, I donât know!!

Ross: We fell asleep! That is all.

Joey: Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, Iâd better go.

Ross: I think that would be best.

Joey: Yeah. All right, Iâll talk to you later.

Ross: Okay. But not about this!

Monica: Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then sheâ¦she wished me good luck.

Chandler: Thatâs sweet.

Monica: No, itâs more like a (sarcastically) good luck.

Chandler: So uh, what did this woman look like?

Monica: She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.

Chandler: Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?

Monica: Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?

Chandler: No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractiveâ¦ (Thinks a little while.) Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.

Monica: What are you doing?

Chandler: Well, letâs seeâ¦ (Finding the picture he wants.) Okay uh, is that her? (Pointing to the picture.)

Monica: Oh my God yes! Who is she?

Chandler: Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.

Monica: Did you break up with her?

Chandler: (pause) No, weâre still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.

Monica: Why?

Chandler: Well, âcause she came back the third summer and sheâd gotten really fa-aa-aw-owâ¦

Monica: Fat?!

Chandler: I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-owâ¦"

Monica: You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!

Chandler: Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?

Monica: Well, apparently she does.

Chandler: Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (Monica is not amused by that statement.) Seriously, good luck marrying me.

Joey: Hey! Whatâs going on?

Rachel: Phoebe is gonna be Monicaâs maid of honor!

Joey: Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember? (Phoebe glares at him.)

Rachel: (shocked) You have been maid of honor before?!!

Phoebe: See? This is exactly why you shouldnât lie!

Rachel: All right thatâs it! I am maid of honor!

Phoebe: Na-uh, I am!

Rachel: How come you are?!

Phoebe: Because I cared enough to lie!

Joey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how youâd handle maid of honor type situations.

Phoebe: What are you talking about?

Joey: Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if Iâm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.

Phoebe: Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?

Joey: Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.

Phoebe: (To Rachel) Well, itâs better than us deciding.

Rachel: Oh, come on! This is crazy! Canât we just flip a coin?!

Phoebe: No! Coins hate me!

Rachel: Okay. Okay fine, yâknow what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. (Ross enters.) (In a sexy voice.) Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.

Phoebe: Hey there, you handsome thing. (Rachel and Phoebe exit.)

Ross: Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.

Joey: Hi.

Ross: Just uh, brought back your videos.

Joey: Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.

Ross: No! No we donât!

Joey: Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!

Ross: Iâ¦ I donât know what you are talking about.

Joey: Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!

Ross: Iâve had better.

Joey: Okay! When?!

Ross: All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!

Joey: Uh-huh!

Ross: Iâve said it! Okay?! But itâs over Joey!

Joey: I want to do it again.

Ross: We canât do it again.

Joey: Why not?

Ross: Because itâs weird!

Joey: Fine! Do you want something to drink?

Chandler: Can you figure out what Iâm doing?

Monica: Youâre Lewis Posin.

Chandler: Who?

Monica: Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?

Chandler: Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!

Monica: No! But because he thought I was to faaaaaâ¦. (Chandler emerges, without flushing by the way.) And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Yâknow, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.

Chandler: What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.

Monica: No, I know. But yâknow what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.

Chandler: Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Ross are laying out the ground rules for the maid of honor auditions to Rachel and Phoebe.]

Joey: Okay, all right, this is how itâs going to work. Weâre gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.

Ross: No, 10 is the highest.

Joey: Why is 10 the highest?

Ross: Because itâs the highest. (Joey shrugs his shoulders) Okay, Rachel youâre up first. (Rachel stands up and gets ready.) Situation No. 1: Youâre with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! (Joey is playing the part of Monica.)

Joey: (crying) I donât want to marry Chandler!

Rachel: Okay, uhâ¦

Joey: Iâve got cold feet.

Rachel: â¦itâs gonna be okay!

Joey: No, one man for the rest of my life? I donât know if I can do it! This means Iâll never get to sleep with Joey!

Rachel: Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Yâknow, itâs-itâs just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You donât get to keep the gifts.

Joey: (out of his Monica character) Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!

Rachel: Thanks!

Ross: Yes, very nice Rachel.

Rachel: Thank you judges.

Phoebe: Ugh, what a kiss ass.

Rachel: Oh!

Joey: Okay, Phoebeâ¦

Phoebe: Yes! Your honor?

Joey: Weâre now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!

Ross: (playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl, I remember thatâ(Phoebe screams and tackles him)âOoh!! Ow! Very good!

Phoebe: Oh!

Joey: Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!

Rachel: Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!

Phoebe: Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!

Ross: It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.

Rachel: Ohh, wait a minute, we havenât preâ¦

Ross: Go!

Rachel: Okay! Okay! Umm, Websterâs Dictionary defines marriage asâ¦ (Ross and Joey start writing.) Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uhâ¦ I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.

Ross and Joey: Oh! Thatâs nice.

Rachel: Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, Iâve known them separately and Iâve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a glass and holds it up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.

Joey: Wow. (To Ross) Good speech.

Ross: Yeah, it really was!

Rachel: Aw, thanks!

Ross: Okay Phoebe, I guess youâre next (To Joey) although I really donât see the point.

Joey: Yeah.

Phoebe: Okay, I canât believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked. (Raises her glass and drinks.)

(Joey and Ross pause while they picture the event.)

Joey: And sheâs back in the game.

[Scene: A random apartment building, Chandler and Monica are knocking on the door of the woman from the beginning.]

Chandler: (she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.

Julie: Hello Skidmark.

Chandler: (To Monica) Itâs a nickname, Iâll explain later.

Monica: Itâs pretty clear.

Chandler: Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.

Julie: Thatâs why you broke up with me?

Chandler: You-you-you didnât know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well, I guess my work here is done!

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Ross are giving Phoebe and Rachel the results of their election. Somewhat faster than Florida I might add.]

Joey: All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for RachelâDamnit!

Phoebe: Really?! I won!

Rachel: What?!

Ross: Iâm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.

Rachel: Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm, I wonder where Iâve heard that before.)

Ross: Actually, it wasnât that close.

Rachel: No! Yâknow what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculousâWeâre gonna flip a coin! (Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips the coin.) Heads! (Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)

Phoebe: The coins have finally forgiven me!

Rachel: Well yâknow what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (Runs out.)

Phoebe: (running after her) Rach, itâs gonna be okay! (To Ross and Joey) You guys are the best!

Joey: Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.

Ross: Yeah?

Joey: Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. (Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.)

Ross: Why-why would I care about that?

Joey: No reason, Iâm just saying that uhâ¦ Thatâs where Iâll be.

(Joey gets up and heads for the door. After a pause Ross decides to join him.)

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler and Monica have returned from Julieâs.]

Chandler: As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Iâm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.

Monica: Why donât you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnât have to apologize.

Chandler: I would really love it if could do both.

Monica: All right, Iâ¦I have to ask.

Chandler: What?

Monica: Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?

Chandler: What?!

Monica: Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?

Chandler: A hundred and forty-five pounds.

Monica: In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! Thatâs not the point.

Chandler: Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!

Monica: Wellâ¦ Thatâs not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.

Chandler: Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.

Monica: How?

Chandler: You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!

Monica: What if I have babies, okay? I mean Iâm gonna look different. Iâm okay with that, but Iâm not sure that you are!

Chandler: Look you have to realize I donât think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is youâre Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.

Monica: Keep going.

Chandler: So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.

Monica: Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?

Chandler: Iâd carry you around in my pocket.

Monica: I love you. (They hug and kiss.)

Chandler: Skidmarkâs still got a way with the ladies.

[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there as Rachel enters carrying a shopping bag.]

Rachel: Hi Pheebs.

Phoebe: Hi!

Rachel: Hi! I just want to apologize. Iâm really sorry I was a baby.

Phoebe: Thatâs ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. (Rachel looks at her.) Oh, you mean today.

Rachel: Yeah. Yeah, and yâknow you-you deserve to win. And-and yâknow I was thinking about it, if-if youâre Monicaâs maid of honor that means I get to be yours.

Phoebe: Oh yeah!

Rachel: Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, yâknow just in caseâ¦

Phoebe: Oh thatâs so sweet thanks.

Rachel: Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (Shows Phoebe the picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and hereâs a little purse that I found. (Hands her the purse) Yâknow I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.

Phoebe: Ohh.

Rachel: And umm, vintage handkerchiefs yâknow âcause, people cry at weddings. (Starting to cry.) Iâm just gonna grab a couple of these.

Phoebe: This stuff is great!

Rachel: Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monicaâs something borrowed and itâs blue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeahâ¦

Phoebe: Yâknow Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monicaâs made of honor.

Rachel: You do? Why?

Phoebe: Because I think it means more to you.

Rachel: But Pheebs, yâknow you earned it.

Phoebe: Its fine. I mean, this is something that youâve been thinking about since you were what, 14? (Sheâs referring to the Halloween picture.)

Rachel: No, I was ten. I just developed early.

Phoebe: (looking at the picture again) Man alive!

Monica: (entering) Hey, whatâs going on?

Rachel: Hey!

Phoebe: Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.

Monica: (gasps) Ohh, wow! Thatâs great! (Rachel and Monica hug.) Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; weâll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? Iâm so excited! (Runs out leaving Rachel completely stunned and Phoebe laughing.)

Rachel: Yeah okay, you laugh now, but sheâs gonna be yours. (Phoebe gets suddenly scared.)

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Ross are napping together again and both wake up at the same time.]

Joey: Great nap.

Ross: It really was.

(Suddenly Rachel clears her throat and the camera cuts to the rest of the gang staring at them. Needless to say Joey and Ross are shocked and slowly turn their heads to see the gang.)

Joey: (reacting first by jumping up) Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God! (Heads for his room leaving Ross.)

Ross: (slowly stands up and says quietly) Excuse me. (Exits.)

End
[Scene: A Restaurant, Phoebe, Rachel, and Monica are having brunch.]

Monica: Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.

Rachel: Oh my God! This is it! (She and Phoebe hold hands.) (To Phoebe) I really hope itâs you!

Phoebe: I hope itâs you.

Rachel: Me too!

Monica: First of all um, I love you both so much and youâre both so important to meâ¦

Rachel: Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!

Monica: Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mineâ¦

Phoebe: Yes!!! Oh!!

Rachel: Hypothetically!

Phoebe: Still.

Monica: If Phoebe were my maid of honorâ¦

Rachel: Uh-hmm.

Monica: Rachel would be Phoebeâs, I would be Rachelâs, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.

Rachel: Yeah thatâs actually a pretty good idea.

Phoebe: Yeah, Iâll do that. So who gets to be yours?

Monica: (laughs) Well thatâs the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!

Phoebe: Wh-why is that the best part?

Monica: Because then I donât have to!

Rachel: Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing (A woman at the table behind them overhears Chandlerâs name and starts listening closer), my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people thatâ¦

Monica: Iâm really not deciding!

Rachel: Fine!

(The woman gets up and walks over to their table.)

Woman: Excuse me, I-I couldnât help overhearing, youâre marrying Chandler Bing?

Monica: Yeah thatâs right.

Woman: (sarcastically) Huh, good luck!

Phoebe: Aww, and good luck to you too! (To Monica and Rachel) What a nice lady!

Opening Credits

[Scene: Ross's apartment, Chandler, Joey, and Ross are finishing watching Die Hard on video.]

Joey: And?

Ross: And itâll be cool to see it again! Yeah!

Joey and Ross: Die Hard!!!!!!

Ross: Dude, you didnât say Die Hard. Is everything okay?

[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is bringing Rachel some coffee.]

Phoebe: Hey Rachel?

Rachel: Yeah?

Phoebe: Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?

Rachel: Really?!

Phoebe: Uh-hmm.

Rachel: Oh my God Phoebe! I mean Iâm justâWait a minute. If Iâm your maid of honor that means you are Monicaâs.

Phoebe: Oh! Well, if thatâs what you wantâ¦

Rachel: Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monicaâs!

Phoebe: But why does it even matter?!

Rachel: Why does it matter so much to you?!

Phoebe: Because this one is now! And-and itâs two of our best friends! Who knows what youâre gonna marry!

Rachel: What-what if I marry RossâOr Joey?

Phoebe: (gasps) You wouldnât! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-Iâve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know youâve done it at least twice!

Rachel: Yeah but Phoebeâ¦

Phoebe: And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. (Rachel stops talking.) Oh I guess that was it.

Rachel: Okay. Okay. Itâsâsince youâve never done it before you can be Monicaâs made of honor.

Phoebe: Oh, thank you so much! (They hug.) Okay.

Rachel: Iâm gonna marry someone good yâknow.

Phoebe: Oh I know.

Rachel: Better than Chandler. (Phoebe exhales as if to say, "Like what isnât?")

[Scene: Ross's apartment, Die Hard has ended, only I donât think Joey and Ross know that yet. As you see, they are both asleep. And theyâre on the same couch. Which means theyâre sleeping together. Not like Joey is at one end and Ross is on the other, they both happen to be lying down and sleeping together. Well, there hasnât been any clothes removed so not that kind of sleeping together. Not that thereâs anything wrong with that. That is unless youâre a Republican in which that kind of thing will bring about the downfall of Western society, especially if they should happen to want to get married. Anyway, let me recap. No, there is too much, let me sum up. Ross and Joey are taking a nap together on top of each other and both wake-up at the same time, realize what they just did, scream, and jump up.]

Ross: What happened?!!

Joey: Well, I donât know!!

Ross: We fell asleep! That is all.

Joey: Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, Iâd better go.

Ross: I think that would be best.

Joey: Yeah. All right, Iâll talk to you later.

Ross: Okay. But not about this!

Joey: No! Never! Never! (Pause, then Joey wants to shake Rossâs hand.) Bye.

Ross: No touch! No touch!

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica has just gotten back from brunch and is telling Chandler about it.]

Monica: Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then sheâ¦she wished me good luck.

Chandler: Thatâs sweet.

Monica: No, itâs more like a (sarcastically) good luck.

Chandler: So uh, what did this woman look like?

Monica: She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.

Chandler: Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?

Monica: Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?

Chandler: No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractiveâ¦ (Thinks a little while.) Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.

Monica: What are you doing?

Chandler: Well, letâs seeâ¦ (Finding the picture he wants.) Okay uh, is that her? (Pointing to the picture.)

Monica: Oh my God yes! Who is she?

Chandler: Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.

Monica: Did you break up with her?

Chandler: (pause) No, weâre still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.

Monica: Why?

Chandler: Well, âcause she came back the third summer and sheâd gotten really fa-aa-aw-owâ¦

Monica: Fat?!

Chandler: I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-owâ¦"

Monica: You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!

Chandler: Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?

Monica: Well, apparently she does.

Chandler: Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (Monica is not amused by that statement.) Seriously, good luck marrying me.

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is entering, Rachel and Phoebe are already there.]

Joey: Hey! Whatâs going on?

Rachel: Phoebe is gonna be Monicaâs maid of honor!

Joey: Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember? (Phoebe glares at him.)

Rachel: (shocked) You have been maid of honor before?!!

Phoebe: See? This is exactly why you shouldnât lie!

Rachel: All right thatâs it! I am maid of honor!

Phoebe: Na-uh, I am!

Rachel: How come you are?!

Phoebe: Because I cared enough to lie!

Joey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how youâd handle maid of honor type situations.

Phoebe: What are you talking about?

Joey: Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if Iâm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.

Phoebe: Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?

Joey: Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.

Phoebe: (To Rachel) Well, itâs better than us deciding.

Rachel: Oh, come on! This is crazy! Canât we just flip a coin?!

Phoebe: No! Coins hate me!

Rachel: Okay. Okay fine, yâknow what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. (Ross enters.) (In a sexy voice.) Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.

Phoebe: Hey there, you handsome thing. (Rachel and Phoebe exit.)

Ross: Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.

Joey: Hi.

Ross: Just uh, brought back your videos.

Joey: Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.

Ross: No! No we donât!

Joey: Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!

Ross: Iâ¦ I donât know what you are talking about.

Joey: Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!

Ross: Iâve had better.

Joey: Okay! When?!

Ross: All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!

Joey: Uh-huh!

Ross: Iâve said it! Okay?! But itâs over Joey!

Joey: I want to do it again.

Ross: We canât do it again.

Joey: Why not?

Ross: Because itâs weird!

Joey: Fine! Do you want something to drink?

Ross: Sure, what do you got?

Joey: Warm milk and Excedrin P.M. (Ross just leaves.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is approaching the bathroom door behind which Chandler is using the facility.]

Monica: Chandler! (Knocks on the door.) Chandler! I just figured out who you are!

Chandler: Can you figure out what Iâm doing?

Monica: Youâre Lewis Posin.

Chandler: Who?

Monica: Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?

Chandler: Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!

Monica: No! But because he thought I was to faaaaaâ¦. (Chandler emerges, without flushing by the way.) And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Yâknow, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.

Chandler: What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.

Monica: No, I know. But yâknow what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.

Chandler: Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Ross are laying out the ground rules for the maid of honor auditions to Rachel and Phoebe.]

Joey: Okay, all right, this is how itâs going to work. Weâre gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.

Ross: No, 10 is the highest.

Joey: Why is 10 the highest?

Ross: Because itâs the highest. (Joey shrugs his shoulders) Okay, Rachel youâre up first. (Rachel stands up and gets ready.) Situation No. 1: Youâre with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! (Joey is playing the part of Monica.)

Joey: (crying) I donât want to marry Chandler!

Rachel: Okay, uhâ¦

Joey: Iâve got cold feet.

Rachel: â¦itâs gonna be okay!

Joey: No, one man for the rest of my life? I donât know if I can do it! This means Iâll never get to sleep with Joey!

Rachel: Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Yâknow, itâs-itâs just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You donât get to keep the gifts.

Joey: (out of his Monica character) Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!

Rachel: Thanks!

Ross: Yes, very nice Rachel.

Rachel: Thank you judges.

Phoebe: Ugh, what a kiss ass.

Rachel: Oh!

Joey: Okay, Phoebeâ¦

Phoebe: Yes! Your honor?

Joey: Weâre now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!

Ross: (playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl, I remember thatâ(Phoebe screams and tackles him)âOoh!! Ow! Very good!

Phoebe: Oh!

Joey: Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!

Rachel: Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!

Phoebe: Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!

Ross: It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.

Rachel: Ohh, wait a minute, we havenât preâ¦

Ross: Go!

Rachel: Okay! Okay! Umm, Websterâs Dictionary defines marriage asâ¦ (Ross and Joey start writing.) Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uhâ¦ I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.

Ross and Joey: Oh! Thatâs nice.

Rachel: Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, Iâve known them separately and Iâve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a glass and holds it up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.

Joey: Wow. (To Ross) Good speech.

Ross: Yeah, it really was!

Rachel: Aw, thanks!

Ross: Okay Phoebe, I guess youâre next (To Joey) although I really donât see the point.

Joey: Yeah.

Phoebe: Okay, I canât believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked. (Raises her glass and drinks.)

(Joey and Ross pause while they picture the event.)

Joey: And sheâs back in the game.

[Scene: A random apartment building, Chandler and Monica are knocking on the door of the woman from the beginning.]

Chandler: (she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.

Julie: Hello Skidmark.

Chandler: (To Monica) Itâs a nickname, Iâll explain later.

Monica: Itâs pretty clear.

Chandler: Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.

Julie: Thatâs why you broke up with me?

Chandler: You-you-you didnât know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well, I guess my work here is done!

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Ross are giving Phoebe and Rachel the results of their election. Somewhat faster than Florida I might add.]

Joey: All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for RachelâDamnit!

Phoebe: Really?! I won!

Rachel: What?!

Ross: Iâm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.

Rachel: Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm, I wonder where Iâve heard that before.)

Ross: Actually, it wasnât that close.

Rachel: No! Yâknow what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculousâWeâre gonna flip a coin! (Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips the coin.) Heads! (Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)

Phoebe: The coins have finally forgiven me!

Rachel: Well yâknow what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (Runs out.)

Phoebe: (running after her) Rach, itâs gonna be okay! (To Ross and Joey) You guys are the best!

Joey: Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.

Ross: Yeah?

Joey: Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. (Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.)

Ross: Why-why would I care about that?

Joey: No reason, Iâm just saying that uhâ¦ Thatâs where Iâll be.

(Joey gets up and heads for the door. After a pause Ross decides to join him.)

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler and Monica have returned from Julieâs.]

Chandler: As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Iâm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.

Monica: Why donât you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnât have to apologize.

Chandler: I would really love it if could do both.

Monica: All right, Iâ¦I have to ask.

Chandler: What?

Monica: Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?

Chandler: What?!

Monica: Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?

Chandler: A hundred and forty-five pounds.

Monica: In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! Thatâs not the point.

Chandler: Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!

Monica: Wellâ¦ Thatâs not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.

Chandler: Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.

Monica: How?

Chandler: You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!

Monica: What if I have babies, okay? I mean Iâm gonna look different. Iâm okay with that, but Iâm not sure that you are!

Chandler: Look you have to realize I donât think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is youâre Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.

Monica: Keep going.

Chandler: So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.

Monica: Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?

Chandler: Iâd carry you around in my pocket.

Monica: I love you. (They hug and kiss.)

Chandler: Skidmarkâs still got a way with the ladies.

[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there as Rachel enters carrying a shopping bag.]

Rachel: Hi Pheebs.

Phoebe: Hi!

Rachel: Hi! I just want to apologize. Iâm really sorry I was a baby.

Phoebe: Thatâs ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. (Rachel looks at her.) Oh, you mean today.

Rachel: Yeah. Yeah, and yâknow you-you deserve to win. And-and yâknow I was thinking about it, if-if youâre Monicaâs maid of honor that means I get to be yours.

Phoebe: Oh yeah!

Rachel: Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, yâknow just in caseâ¦

Phoebe: Oh thatâs so sweet thanks.

Rachel: Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (Shows Phoebe the picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and hereâs a little purse that I found. (Hands her the purse) Yâknow I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.

Phoebe: Ohh.

Rachel: And umm, vintage handkerchiefs yâknow âcause, people cry at weddings. (Starting to cry.) Iâm just gonna grab a couple of these.

Phoebe: This stuff is great!

Rachel: Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monicaâs something borrowed and itâs blue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeahâ¦

Phoebe: Yâknow Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monicaâs made of honor.

Rachel: You do? Why?

Phoebe: Because I think it means more to you.

Rachel: But Pheebs, yâknow you earned it.

Phoebe: Its fine. I mean, this is something that youâve been thinking about since you were what, 14? (Sheâs referring to the Halloween picture.)

Rachel: No, I was ten. I just developed early.

Phoebe: (looking at the picture again) Man alive!

Monica: (entering) Hey, whatâs going on?

Rachel: Hey!

Phoebe: Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.

Monica: (gasps) Ohh, wow! Thatâs great! (Rachel and Monica hug.) Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; weâll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? Iâm so excited! (Runs out leaving Rachel completely stunned and Phoebe laughing.)

Rachel: Yeah okay, you laugh now, but sheâs gonna be yours. (Phoebe gets suddenly scared.)

Ending Credits

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Ross are napping together again and both wake up at the same time.]

Joey: Great nap.

Ross: It really was.

(Suddenly Rachel clears her throat and the camera cuts to the rest of the gang staring at them. Needless to say Joey and Ross are shocked and slowly turn their heads to see the gang.)

Joey: (reacting first by jumping up) Dude! What the hell are you doing?! God! (Heads for his room leaving Ross.)

Ross: (slowly stands up and says quietly) Excuse me. (Exits.)

End
[Scene: A Restaurant, Phoebe, Rachel, and Monica are having brunch.]

Monica: Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.

Rachel: Oh my God! This is it! (She and Phoebe hold hands.) (To Phoebe) I really hope itâs you!

Phoebe: I hope itâs you.

Rachel: Me too!

Monica: First of all um, I love you both so much and youâre both so important to meâ¦

Rachel: Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!

Monica: Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade of being maid of honor for each other. Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mineâ¦

Phoebe: Yes!!! Oh!!

Rachel: Hypothetically!

Phoebe: Still.

Monica: If Phoebe were my maid of honorâ¦

Rachel: Uh-hmm.

Monica: Rachel would be Phoebeâs, I would be Rachelâs, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.

Rachel: Yeah thatâs actually a pretty good idea.

Phoebe: Yeah, Iâll do that. So who gets to be yours?

Monica: (laughs) Well thatâs the best part. Umm, you guys get to decide!

Phoebe: Wh-why is that the best part?

Monica: Because then I donât have to!

Rachel: Well of course we will help you decide! We will do anything we can to help you! Now, I would like to make a toast, to the future Mrs. Chandler Bing (A woman at the table behind them overhears Chandlerâs name and starts listening closer), my best friend, and truly one of the nicest people thatâ¦

Monica: Iâm really not deciding!

Rachel: Fine!

(The woman gets up and walks over to their table.)

Woman: Excuse me, I-I couldnât help overhearing, youâre marrying Chandler Bing?

Monica: Yeah thatâs right.

Woman: (sarcastically) Huh, good luck!

Phoebe: Aww, and good luck to you too! (To Monica and Rachel) What a nice lady!

Opening Credits

[Scene: Ross's apartment, Chandler, Joey, and Ross are finishing watching Die Hard on video.]

[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is bringing Rachel some coffee.]

Phoebe: Hey Rachel?

Rachel: Yeah?

Phoebe: Umm, when I get married will you be my maid of honor?

Rachel: Really?!

Phoebe: Uh-hmm.

Rachel: Oh my God Phoebe! I mean Iâm justâWait a minute. If Iâm your maid of honor that means you are Monicaâs.

Phoebe: Oh! Well, if thatâs what you wantâ¦

Rachel: Ohh! No way Phoebe! I want to be Monicaâs!

Phoebe: But why does it even matter?!

Rachel: Why does it matter so much to you?!

Phoebe: Because this one is now! And-and itâs two of our best friends! Who knows what youâre gonna marry!

Rachel: What-what if I marry RossâOr Joey?

Phoebe: (gasps) You wouldnât! Okay look, Rachel I know you really want to do this, but I-Iâve never been maid of honor to anyone before! And I know youâve done it at least twice!

Rachel: Yeah but Phoebeâ¦

Phoebe: And no, oh please, oh please let me finish. (Rachel stops talking.) Oh I guess that was it.

Rachel: Okay. Okay. Itâsâsince youâve never done it before you can be Monicaâs made of honor.

Phoebe: Oh, thank you so much! (They hug.) Okay.

Rachel: Iâm gonna marry someone good yâknow.

Phoebe: Oh I know.

Rachel: Better than Chandler. (Phoebe exhales as if to say, "Like what isnât?")

[Scene: Ross's apartment, Die Hard has ended, only I donât think Joey and Ross know that yet. As you see, they are both asleep. And theyâre on the same couch. Which means theyâre sleeping together. Not like Joey is at one end and Ross is on the other, they both happen to be lying down and sleeping together. Well, there hasnât been any clothes removed so not that kind of sleeping together. Not that thereâs anything wrong with that. That is unless youâre a Republican in which that kind of thing will bring about the downfall of Western society, especially if they should happen to want to get married. Anyway, let me recap. No, there is too much, let me sum up. Ross and Joey are taking a nap together on top of each other and both wake-up at the same time, realize what they just did, scream, and jump up.]

Ross: What happened?!!

Joey: Well, I donât know!!

Ross: We fell asleep! That is all.

Joey: Yeah. Yep. Yeah. All right, well uh, Iâd better go.

Ross: I think that would be best.

Joey: Yeah. All right, Iâll talk to you later.

Ross: Okay. But not about this!

Joey: No! Never! Never! (Pause, then Joey wants to shake Rossâs hand.) Bye.

Ross: No touch! No touch!

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica has just gotten back from brunch and is telling Chandler about it.]

Monica: Yeah hey, a weird thing happened today whey I was at brunch. This woman overheard that I was marrying you and-and then sheâ¦she wished me good luck.

Chandler: Thatâs sweet.

Monica: No, itâs more like a (sarcastically) good luck.

Chandler: So uh, what did this woman look like?

Monica: She was like 30, dark hair, attractive.

Chandler: Well, is there any chance you were looking into a bright, shiny thing called a mirror?

Monica: Come on, was it somebody maybe you dated in college?

Chandler: No, no I only dated two girls in college, both blonde, both not attractiveâ¦ (Thinks a little while.) Hold on one second; let me check this out. (He gets up and grabs a photo album.

Monica: What are you doing?

Chandler: Well, letâs seeâ¦ (Finding the picture he wants.) Okay uh, is that her? (Pointing to the picture.)

Monica: Oh my God yes! Who is she?

Chandler: Julie Grath, my camp girlfriend.

Monica: Did you break up with her?

Chandler: (pause) No, weâre still together. Yeah we went out for two summers, and then I broke up with her.

Monica: Why?

Chandler: Well, âcause she came back the third summer and sheâd gotten really fa-aa-aw-owâ¦

Monica: Fat?!

Chandler: I did not say fat! I said, "Fa-aa-aw-owâ¦"

Monica: You broke up with a girl because she was fat?!

Chandler: Yeah. Yeah, but it was a really, really long time ago! Does she still feel bad?

Monica: Well, apparently she does.

Chandler: Well, you know what they say, elephants never forget. (Monica is not amused by that statement.) Seriously, good luck marrying me.

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is entering, Rachel and Phoebe are already there.]

Joey: Hey! Whatâs going on?

Rachel: Phoebe is gonna be Monicaâs maid of honor!

Joey: Hey! Well I hope it goes better than the last time you did it for that girl downstairs, remember? (Phoebe glares at him.)

Rachel: (shocked) You have been maid of honor before?!!

Phoebe: See? This is exactly why you shouldnât lie!

Rachel: All right thatâs it! I am maid of honor!

Phoebe: Na-uh, I am!

Rachel: How come you are?!

Phoebe: Because I cared enough to lie!

Joey: Hey-hey-hey-hey, I can help you decide who should do it! Yeah, we could have like uh, like an audition and see how youâd handle maid of honor type situations.

Phoebe: What are you talking about?

Joey: Like when I want a job, I go to an audition and if Iâm the best of the people they see, they give me the part.

Phoebe: Okay, so after this audition, who decides who gets it?

Joey: Oh uh, me and Ross can be the judges.

Phoebe: (To Rachel) Well, itâs better than us deciding.

Rachel: Oh, come on! This is crazy! Canât we just flip a coin?!

Phoebe: No! Coins hate me!

Rachel: Okay. Okay fine, yâknow what? We will let Ross and Joey decide. (Ross enters.) (In a sexy voice.) Hiiiii, Ross! Sweetie.

Phoebe: Hey there, you handsome thing. (Rachel and Phoebe exit.)

Ross: Wow, this cologne really is every bit as good as Georgio.

Joey: Hi.

Ross: Just uh, brought back your videos.

Joey: Uh hey look uh Ross, look I think we need to talk about before.

Ross: No! No we donât!

Joey: Yes we do! Now look, that was the best nap I ever had!!

Ross: Iâ¦ I donât know what you are talking about.

Joey: Come on! Admit it! That was the best nap you ever had!

Ross: Iâve had better.

Joey: Okay! When?!

Ross: All right! All right! It was the best nap ever!

Joey: Uh-huh!

Ross: Iâve said it! Okay?! But itâs over Joey!

Joey: I want to do it again.

Ross: We canât do it again.

Joey: Why not?

Ross: Because itâs weird!

Joey: Fine! Do you want something to drink?

Ross: Sure, what do you got?

Joey: Warm milk and Excedrin P.M. (Ross just leaves.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is approaching the bathroom door behind which Chandler is using the facility.]

Monica: Chandler! (Knocks on the door.) Chandler! I just figured out who you are!

Chandler: Can you figure out what Iâm doing?

Monica: Youâre Lewis Posin.

Chandler: Who?

Monica: Lewis Posin! He was my best friend in fifth grade, and-and then one day I asked him to be my boyfriend and he said no. Do you know why?

Chandler: Because you kept talking to him while he was trying to go to the bathroom?!

Monica: No! But because he thought I was to faaaaaâ¦. (Chandler emerges, without flushing by the way.) And every time I think about it, it makes me feel as bad as I did in fifth grade! Yâknow, I-I really think that you should apologize to Julie.

Chandler: What? Are you kidding? That was like 16 years ago.

Monica: No, I know. But yâknow what? It would make me feel better if Lewis apologized to me.

Chandler: Okay, I will do it. But I have to warn you; this may make me a better person and that is not the man you feel in love with!

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey and Ross are laying out the ground rules for the maid of honor auditions to Rachel and Phoebe.]

Joey: Okay, all right, this is how itâs going to work. Weâre gonna give you hypothetical maid of honor situations and you will be scored on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the highest.

Ross: No, 10 is the highest.

Joey: Why is 10 the highest?

Ross: Because itâs the highest. (Joey shrugs his shoulders) Okay, Rachel youâre up first. (Rachel stands up and gets ready.) Situation No. 1: Youâre with Monica, the wedding is about to start when Monica gets cold feet. Go! (Joey is playing the part of Monica.)

Joey: (crying) I donât want to marry Chandler!

Rachel: Okay, uhâ¦

Joey: Iâve got cold feet.

Rachel: â¦itâs gonna be okay!

Joey: No, one man for the rest of my life? I donât know if I can do it! This means Iâll never get to sleep with Joey!

Rachel: Look Monica, getting cold feet is very common. Yâknow, itâs-itâs just because of all the anticipation and you just have to remember that you love Chandler. And also, I ran out on a wedding. You donât get to keep the gifts.

Joey: (out of his Monica character) Very good! Drawing on your own experience, I like that!

Rachel: Thanks!

Ross: Yes, very nice Rachel.

Rachel: Thank you judges.

Phoebe: Ugh, what a kiss ass.

Rachel: Oh!

Joey: Okay, Phoebeâ¦

Phoebe: Yes! Your honor?

Joey: Weâre now in the ceremony, Monica is about to say, "I do" when her drunk uncle starts yelling. What do you do? Go!

Ross: (playing the drunk uncle) When Monica was a little girl, I remember thatâ(Phoebe screams and tackles him)âOoh!! Ow! Very good!

Phoebe: Oh!

Joey: Yes! Excellent! Perfect score!

Rachel: Wait a minute! She just made a scene in the middle of the ceremony!

Phoebe: Hey! Do you want do you want a little taste of Pheebs?!

Ross: It is time for you to give your maid of honor speech.

Rachel: Ohh, wait a minute, we havenât preâ¦

Ross: Go!

Rachel: Okay! Okay! Umm, Websterâs Dictionary defines marriage asâ¦ (Ross and Joey start writing.) Okay!! Forget that! That sucks!! Okay, never mind! Forget it! Umm, umm, okay, uhâ¦ I met, I-I met, I met Monica when we were just a couple of six year olds and I became friends with Chandler when he was 25, although he seemed like a six year old.

Ross and Joey: Oh! Thatâs nice.

Rachel: Thank you. Thank you very much. Umm, Iâve known them separately and Iâve known them together and-and to know them as a couple is to know that you are truly in the presence of love. So I would like to raise my glass (Grabs a glass and holds it up) to Monica and Chandler and the beautiful adventure they are about to embark upon together. I can think of no two people better prepared for the journey.

Joey: Wow. (To Ross) Good speech.

Ross: Yeah, it really was!

Rachel: Aw, thanks!

Ross: Okay Phoebe, I guess youâre next (To Joey) although I really donât see the point.

Joey: Yeah.

Phoebe: Okay, I canât believe that Monica and Chandler are getting married. I remember talking about this day with Rachel while we were showering together, naked. (Raises her glass and drinks.)

(Joey and Ross pause while they picture the event.)

Joey: And sheâs back in the game.

[Scene: A random apartment building, Chandler and Monica are knocking on the door of the woman from the beginning.]

Chandler: (she opens the door) Julie hi! Chandler Bing, I, I guess you remember me.

Julie: Hello Skidmark.

Chandler: (To Monica) Itâs a nickname, Iâll explain later.

Monica: Itâs pretty clear.

Chandler: Ah, uh, I owe you a long overdue apology. I never should have broken up with you because you were overweight.

Julie: Thatâs why you broke up with me?

Chandler: You-you-you didnât know that. (Pause as she nods no.) Well, I guess my work here is done!

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey and Ross are giving Phoebe and Rachel the results of their election. Somewhat faster than Florida I might add.]

Joey: All right, well first of all I would like to say that you both performed very well. Okay? You should be proud of yourselves. And-and I would also like to say that in this competition there are no losers. Well, except for RachelâDamnit!

Phoebe: Really?! I won!

Rachel: What?!

Ross: Iâm sorry Rach, it was, it was really close.

Rachel: Well then I demand a recount! (Hmm, I wonder where Iâve heard that before.)

Ross: Actually, it wasnât that close.

Rachel: No! Yâknow what? No! No! You thing was so stupid anyway, this was ridiculousâWeâre gonna flip a coin! (Phoebe gasps.) All right?! (She flips the coin.) Heads! (Looks at the coin and grunts in disgust.)

Phoebe: The coins have finally forgiven me!

Rachel: Well yâknow what? I hope Monica forgives you after you throw her, her vegetarian, voodoo, goddess circley shower! (Runs out.)

Phoebe: (running after her) Rach, itâs gonna be okay! (To Ross and Joey) You guys are the best!

Joey: Boy I tell ya, that judging stuff took a lot out of me.

Ross: Yeah?

Joey: Yeah! I was thinking about maybe going upstairs and taking a little nap on my couch. (Raises his eyebrows, questioning Ross to see if he wants to join him.)

Ross: Why-why would I care about that?

Joey: No reason, Iâm just saying that uhâ¦ Thatâs where Iâll be.

(Joey gets up and heads for the door. After a pause Ross decides to join him.)

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler and Monica have returned from Julieâs.]

Chandler: As bad as that went I actually enjoyed myself. I think that Iâm going to apologize for all of the stupid things I do.

Monica: Why donât you just stop doing stupid things? Then you wouldnât have to apologize.

Chandler: I would really love it if could do both.

Monica: All right, Iâ¦I have to ask.

Chandler: What?

Monica: Are you gonna break up with me if I get fat again?

Chandler: What?!

Monica: Well, you broke up with Julie Grath! How much weight could she have gained?

Chandler: A hundred and forty-five pounds.

Monica: In one year?! My God what did she eat? Her-her family! Thatâs not the point.

Chandler: Look I know it was a stupid reason to break up with somebody, but I was 15!

Monica: Wellâ¦ Thatâs not the only time this was an issue. You remember when umm, you spent Thanksgiving with us? You called me fat.

Chandler: Okay. Okay, now wait a minute that was totally different.

Monica: How?

Chandler: You were not supposed to hear that! I said that behind you back!

Monica: What if I have babies, okay? I mean Iâm gonna look different. Iâm okay with that, but Iâm not sure that you are!

Chandler: Look you have to realize I donât think of you as a thin, beautiful woman. (Monica glares at him.) See this is one of things that I can apologize for later! Look, what I mean is youâre Monica! Okay? And I am in love with Monica.

Monica: Keep going.

Chandler: So you can balloon up or you can shrink down and I will still love you.

Monica: Even if I shrink down to two inches tall?

Chandler: Iâd carry you around in my pocket.

Monica: I love you. (They hug and kiss.)

Chandler: Skidmarkâs still got a way with the ladies.

[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is there as Rachel enters carrying a shopping bag.]

Rachel: Hi Pheebs.

Phoebe: Hi!

Rachel: Hi! I just want to apologize. Iâm really sorry I was a baby.

Phoebe: Thatâs ridiculous Rachel, we were all babies once. (Rachel looks at her.) Oh, you mean today.

Rachel: Yeah. Yeah, and yâknow you-you deserve to win. And-and yâknow I was thinking about it, if-if youâre Monicaâs maid of honor that means I get to be yours.

Phoebe: Oh yeah!

Rachel: Yeah! Oh, umm when-when Monica and Chandler got engaged I started putting some stuff together, yâknow just in caseâ¦

Phoebe: Oh thatâs so sweet thanks.

Rachel: Here is a book of poetry that I know Monica loves. And-and ohh God this is funny, look, this is a picture of one Halloween where she dressed up as a bride. (Shows Phoebe the picture.) And look, she made me carry her train, which was weird because I was Wonder Woman. Oh and hereâs a little purse that I found. (Hands her the purse) Yâknow I just thought that maybe they could hold the rings in there.

Phoebe: Ohh.

Rachel: And umm, vintage handkerchiefs yâknow âcause, people cry at weddings. (Starting to cry.) Iâm just gonna grab a couple of these.

Phoebe: This stuff is great!

Rachel: Oh, I forgot this was in here. Umm, this was the uh garter that I was saving for my wedding and I wanted it to be Monicaâs something borrowed and itâs blue. (Starts to cry again.) Yeahâ¦

Phoebe: Yâknow Rach, I think that, I think you should be Monicaâs made of honor.

Rachel: You do? Why?

Phoebe: Because I think it means more to you.

Rachel: But Pheebs, yâknow you earned it.

Phoebe: Its fine. I mean, this is something that youâve been thinking about since you were what, 14? (Sheâs referring to the Halloween picture.)

Rachel: No, I was ten. I just developed early.

Phoebe: (looking at the picture again) Man alive!

Monica: (entering) Hey, whatâs going on?

Rachel: Hey!

Phoebe: Well, we just decided that Rachel is gonna be your maid of honor.

Monica: (gasps) Ohh, wow! Thatâs great! (Rachel and Monica hug.) Oh wow! We really have to start planning! I have, I have a lot of really specific ideas! We should probably get together like four times per week. You can come over to my place; weâll get together before work! What do you say, 6:30, my place? Iâm so excited! (Runs out leaving Rachel completely stunned and Phoebe laughing.)

Rachel: Yeah okay, you laugh now, but sheâs gonna be yours. (Phoebe gets suddenly scared.)

Joey: Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; Iâm late for work.

Rachel: What-what?! Youâre gonna leave this person with me?!

Joey: YeahâHey, donât worry, sheâs a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that Iâm not looking for a serious relationship; thatâd be great.

Rachel: Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!

Joey: Just casually slip it in, yâknow lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, Iâm a lonerâNo! An outlaw! Tell her she doesnât want to get mixed up with the likes of me.

Rachel: Yâknow what? Thatâs a lot to remember, canât I just tell her youâre a pig?

Joey: Hey, Iâm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! Heâd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, heâd make extras and leave âem for me.

Rachel: Well forget it, Iâm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.

Rachel: Hi.

Erin: Hi. I donât mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?

Yeah, itâs right-itâs right down here! In the biggest library in the university! (They start heading that way, towards a secluded section behind the racks.)

Ross: (stopping quickly) Oh umm, thereâs also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. (They both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next aisle.) What is that?

Chandler: Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.

(They go around the last row of bookshelves and find a couple doing what college coeds do in secluded corners of university libraries. For those of you who donât know what Iâm talking about, letâs just say that clothing is undone. Ross gasps and the couple gets up and runs away.)

Monica: Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!

(The waitress lets her in as Monica is about to throw a lobster into a pot of boiling water (Although, she hasnât taken off the rubber bands that hold the claws, so she canât be that good of a chef). Anyway, guess who the Colonel is by the following phrase.)

The Colonel: OHâ¦MYâ¦GAWD!!!! (Yep, itâs Janice.)

Monica: (to the lobster) Lucky bastard! (Throws the lobster in and turns around to face the planetâs most annoying woman, next to Dr. Laura and Kathy Lee Gifford of course. Sheâs the most annoying female TV character however.) Janice.

Chandler: Lie!!! How hard is that?! The checkâs in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I canât wait to read your book Ross!!

Monica: Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it wonât be so bad.

Chandler: What do you think sheâs just gonna sit there quietly? You donât think sheâs gonna want to make a toast? You donât think sheâs gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!

Monica: Oh my God, sheâs not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!

Chandler: Yâknow what? Itâs gonna be okay. Yâknow what? Sheâs probably not gonna even want to come.

Monica: Really?

Chandler: No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?

Monica: So-so you wouldâve just lied?

Ross: Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.

Rachel: Yeah, there was. It wasâthere the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever readâYes, there was.

Commercial Break

[Scene: The Library, Ross enters and heads to the desk to talk to the male librarian on duty.]

Ross: Excuse me. Hi, Iâm a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?

The Librarian: Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.

Ross: No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarian brings his boss over.)

The Head Librarian: How can I help you?

Ross: Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.

The Head Librarian: We are aware of the problem you are referring too. (He turns to look at the previous librarian.) But as far as increasing security, Iâm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I canât help you.

Ross: Well, fine. Fine! If-if Iâm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, Iâll go up there and defend it myself! (Starts to do so, but stops and to the previous librarian) And donât you follow me!

Phoebe: Yay!! Oh so, youâre not, youâre not mad at us anymore?

Joey: No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Yâknow? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.

Phoebe: Didnât you sleep together?

Joey: Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well thatâs aâ¦

Monica: Is that all?

Janice: I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why donât you tell about your lovely wedding?

Chandler: Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, itâs going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! Weâre not even sure why weâre having it.

Monica: Itâs actually going to be just family.

Erin: Uh, okay.

Rachel: Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.

Erin: Look, heâs a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just donât see this having a future.

Rachel: But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!

Erin: Kinda.

Phoebe: Then change it back!

Erin: Iâm sorry Iâ¦ Itâs just thereâs no real spark.

Phoebe: No spark? Didnât you sleep together?

Erin: Yeah.

Rachel: Ugh, tramp!

Phoebe: Does Joey have any idea?

Erin: I really donât think he does. And yâknow what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Yâknow, tell him Iâm-Iâm not interested in a serious relationship or something.

Phoebe: Yeah, you mean like that youâre kind of a loner.

Erin: Yeah! That would be great!

Phoebe: Yeah, and maybe that youâre a real (She says something in Italian, and it doesnât matter what she said. Itâs not important so I donât need everyone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.)

Phoebe: Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?

Joey: No-no-no-no-no! Itâs a surprise, but itâs gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.

Phoebe and Rachel: Oh no, yeah.

Rachel: Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, sheâs not lookinâ for a serious relationship.

(Joey walks into view of the open door behind Janice, sees her, gets a terrified look on his face, and flees in horror.) I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.

Monica: (To Chandler) Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice arenât they?

Janice: Please, itâs because otherwise I really donât know what I might do.

Chandler: Janice, Iâm sorry but umm, you canât stay here tonight.

(And she does the laugh.)

Janice: Okay, Iâm going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. (Makes some weird sound) Do you have a cat? âCause itâs already happening. (Makes a nasal sound) Do you hear that? (She keeps making the nasal sound.)

(Chandler does the same nasal sound to Chandler.)

Monica: Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!

Janice: Why?

Monica: Because Chandler still has feelings for you!

Janice: He does?

Chandler: Say again?

Monica: Thatâs right. Thatâs right. And that is why you canât stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldnât come to the wedding.

Chandler: Feelings, such strong feelings.

Monica: I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.

Janice: Ohâ¦my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, Iâll go. (Starts for the door.) Good-bye Monica (hugs her), I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, (hugs him) you call me when this goes in the pooper. (Hurries out.)

Joey: Okay, really good. Anyway I gotta go; Iâm late for work.

Rachel: What-what?! Youâre gonna leave this person with me?!

Joey: YeahâHey, donât worry, sheâs a terrific girl. And hey listen, could you do me a favor? When she comes out could you just mention that Iâm not looking for a serious relationship; thatâd be great.

Rachel: Why?! What?! Are you kidding?!

Joey: Just casually slip it in, yâknow lay the groundwork. Tell her uh, Iâm a lonerâNo! An outlaw! Tell her she doesnât want to get mixed up with the likes of me.

Rachel: Yâknow what? Thatâs a lot to remember, canât I just tell her youâre a pig?

Joey: Hey, Iâm gonna call her later! Honest! Oh come on, Chandler used to do it! Heâd even make the girl pancakes! Plus, heâd make extras and leave âem for me.

Rachel: Well forget it, Iâm not telling that girl anything. That is not my responsibility.

Joey: Fine! (Pause) Now, whereâd we land on those pancakes? (She chases him out the door as his date emerges from the bathroom.)

Joeyâs Date: Hi!

Rachel: Hi.

Joeyâs Date: Sorry about that, but I couldnât get that lock to work on the door.

Rachel: Yeah, Joey kinda disabled it when I moved in.

Joeyâs Date: You must be Rachel, Iâm Erin.

Rachel: Hi.

Erin: Hi. I donât mean this to sound like high school, but did he say anything about me?

Rachel: (pause) Would you like some pancakes?

Chandler: The hot chicks?

Ross: Okay, okay, I was typing names into the library computer earlier, yâknow-yâknow for fun, and I typed mine in and guess what came up? My doctoral dissertation! Itâs here! Yeah, itâs right-itâs right down here! In the biggest library in the university! (They start heading that way, towards a secluded section behind the racks.)

Chandler: Wow thatâs actually pretty cool.

Ross: (stopping quickly) Oh umm, thereâs also a book here by a woman named Wendy Bagina. (They both laugh, but stop when the hear moaning coming from the next aisle.) What is that?

Chandler: Sounds like two people are really enjoying the Dewey decimal system.

(They go around the last row of bookshelves and find a couple doing what college coeds do in secluded corners of university libraries. For those of you who donât know what Iâm talking about, letâs just say that clothing is undone. Ross gasps and the couple gets up and runs away.)

Monica: Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!

(The waitress lets her in as Monica is about to throw a lobster into a pot of boiling water (Although, she hasnât taken off the rubber bands that hold the claws, so she canât be that good of a chef). Anyway, guess who the Colonel is by the following phrase.)

The Colonel: OHâ¦MYâ¦GAWD!!!! (Yep, itâs Janice.)

Monica: (to the lobster) Lucky bastard! (Throws the lobster in and turns around to face the planetâs most annoying woman, next to Dr. Laura and Kathy Lee Gifford of course. Sheâs the most annoying female TV character however.) Janice.

Janice: How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever! (Does the laugh.)

Monica: Well, she saw the ring.

Chandler: Did she freak out?

Monica: Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.

Monica: Huh?

Chandler: You said no right?!

Monica: Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!

Chandler: Lie!!! How hard is that?! The checkâs in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I canât wait to read your book Ross!!

Monica: Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it wonât be so bad.

Chandler: What do you think sheâs just gonna sit there quietly? You donât think sheâs gonna want to make a toast? You donât think sheâs gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!

Monica: Oh my God, sheâs not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!

Chandler: Yâknow what? Itâs gonna be okay. Yâknow what? Sheâs probably not gonna even want to come.

Monica: Really?

Chandler: No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?

Monica: So-so you wouldâve just lied?

Phoebe: Yeah, but you always say that.

Rachel: Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.

Joey: Look Iâm sorry you guys, I-I just donât think so.

Phoebe: Whatever.

Rachel: Fine. (They start to walk away.)

Rachel: Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?

Ross: Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.

Rachel: Yeah, there was. It wasâthere the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever readâYes, there was.

Ross: Great! Because people kept showing up, I think itâs like uh-a thing!

Joey: Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?

Ross: Oh for cryinâ out loud! (He storms out.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: The Library, Ross enters and heads to the desk to talk to the male librarian on duty.]

Ross: Excuse me. Hi, Iâm a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?

The Librarian: Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.

Ross: No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarian brings his boss over.)

The Head Librarian: How can I help you?

Ross: Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.

The Head Librarian: We are aware of the problem you are referring too. (He turns to look at the previous librarian.) But as far as increasing security, Iâm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I canât help you.

Ross: Well, fine. Fine! If-if Iâm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, Iâll go up there and defend it myself! (Starts to do so, but stops and to the previous librarian) And donât you follow me!

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Rachel and Phoebe are doing dishes as Joey enters.]

Rachel: How did it go with Erin?

Joey: Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!

Phoebe: Yay!! Oh so, youâre not, youâre not mad at us anymore?

Joey: No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Yâknow? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.

Phoebe: Didnât you sleep together?

Joey: Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well thatâs aâ¦

Janice: Oh, what are you, stupid? Itâs been three hours.

Monica: Is that all?

Janice: I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why donât you tell about your lovely wedding?

Chandler: Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, itâs going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! Weâre not even sure why weâre having it.

Monica: Itâs actually going to be just family.

Janice: Ohâ¦waitâ¦you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?

Rachel: So howâs it goinâ with Joey?

Erin: Uh, okay.

Rachel: Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.

Erin: Look, heâs a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just donât see this having a future.

Rachel: But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!

Erin: Kinda.

Phoebe: Then change it back!

Erin: Iâm sorry Iâ¦ Itâs just thereâs no real spark.

Phoebe: No spark? Didnât you sleep together?

Erin: Yeah.

Rachel: Ugh, tramp!

Phoebe: Does Joey have any idea?

Erin: I really donât think he does. And yâknow what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Yâknow, tell him Iâm-Iâm not interested in a serious relationship or something.

Phoebe: Yeah, you mean like that youâre kind of a loner.

Erin: Yeah! That would be great!

Phoebe: Yeah, and maybe that youâre a real (She says something in Italian, and it doesnât matter what she said. Itâs not important so I donât need everyone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.)

Erin: Iâm sorry?

Guy: Uhhâ¦.

Ross: Ahâ¦ Ahâ¦Get out of here! (The couple retreats. Ross starts looking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the section.) Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marionâs views on evolution?

Phoebe: Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?

Joey: No-no-no-no-no! Itâs a surprise, but itâs gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.

Phoebe and Rachel: Oh no, yeah.

Rachel: Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, sheâs not lookinâ for a serious relationship.

Monica: Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?

Janice: Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldnât really be alone tonight. (Joey walks into view of the open door behind Janice, sees her, gets a terrified look on his face, and flees in horror.) I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.

Monica: (To Chandler) Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice arenât they?

Janice: Please, itâs because otherwise I really donât know what I might do.

Chandler: Janice, Iâm sorry but umm, you canât stay here tonight.

Janice: Why not?

Chandler: Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.

(And she does the laugh.)

Janice: Okay, Iâm going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. (Makes some weird sound) Do you have a cat? âCause itâs already happening. (Makes a nasal sound) Do you hear that? (She keeps making the nasal sound.)

(Chandler does the same nasal sound to Chandler.)

Monica: Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!

Janice: Why?

Monica: Because Chandler still has feelings for you!

Janice: He does?

Chandler: Say again?

Monica: Thatâs right. Thatâs right. And that is why you canât stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldnât come to the wedding.

Chandler: Feelings, such strong feelings.

Monica: I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.

Janice: Ohâ¦my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, Iâll go. (Starts for the door.) Good-bye Monica (hugs her), I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, (hugs him) you call me when this goes in the pooper. (Hurries out.)

Monica: Well fine! I want to meet this chicken expert! Send the Colonel in!

(The waitress lets her in as Monica is about to throw a lobster into a pot of boiling water (Although, she hasnât taken off the rubber bands that hold the claws, so she canât be that good of a chef). Anyway, guess who the Colonel is by the following phrase.)

The Colonel: OHâ¦MYâ¦GAWD!!!! (Yep, itâs Janice.)

Monica: (to the lobster) Lucky bastard! (Throws the lobster in and turns around to face the planetâs most annoying woman, next to Dr. Laura and Kathy Lee Gifford of course. Sheâs the most annoying female TV character however.) Janice.

Janice: How are you Ms. Hot Shot chef with the big fancy restaurant with the best chicken ever! (Does the laugh.)

Monica: Iâm fine.

Janice: (notices Monicaâs engagement ring) Ohh! What is that on your finger?! Iâm blind!

Monica: Ohâ¦ Uhâ¦

Janice: So, whoâs the lucky guy?

[Cut to Monica and Chandlerâs just after Monica has finished telling Chandler what happened.]

Chandler: OHâ¦MYâ¦GAWD! I am so sorry sweetie, are you okay? You didnât tell her we were getting married, did you?

Monica: Well, she saw the ring.

Chandler: Did she freak out?

Monica: Well, she was shocked when I told her, but then again so were most people.

Chandler: Right.

Monica: Well, she actually has a boyfriend yâknow herself, named Clark. Uh, she also kinda invited herself to our wedding. Clark too.

Chandler: (laughs) You said no right?

Monica: Huh?

Chandler: You said no right?!

Monica: Well, she corned me! She asked if the wedding was in town! I mean, what was I supposed to do?!

Chandler: Lie!!! How hard is that?! The checkâs in the mail! Oh your baby is so cute! I canât wait to read your book Ross!!

Monica: Come on! So she comes to the wedding! I mean it wonât be so bad.

Chandler: What do you think sheâs just gonna sit there quietly? You donât think sheâs gonna want to make a toast? You donât think sheâs gonna want to grab the microphone and sing Part-time Lover?!

Monica: Oh my God, sheâs not gonna like the chicken that night either is she?!

Chandler: Yâknow what? Itâs gonna be okay. Yâknow what? Sheâs probably not gonna even want to come.

Monica: Really?

Chandler: No! That was a lie! See how easy that was?

Monica: So-so you wouldâve just lied?

Chandler: Yes!!

Monica: Would it really have been that easy?

Chandler: Yes!!!

Monica: Good, so do it Saturday night because weâre going to dinner with her and Clark.

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey is coming back from work to find Phoebe, Rachel, and someone else with her back turned is there.]

Joey: Hey! Whatâs up?

Phoebe and Rachel: Hey!

Joey: Hey-hey, whoâs your friend? (Erin turns around to face Joey, startling him) Hey!!

Erin: Hey Joey!

Joey: Erin! Still here!

Rachel: Yeah, we ended up spending the day together and had such a great time!

Joey: So, system kinda broke down huh?!

Rachel: Oh Joey, Iâm sorry I just couldnât tell her all those things you wanted me to tell her. And yâknow we got to talking and Iâ¦

Phoebe: We want you to marry her!

Joey: What?!!

Phoebe: She is so amazing! You have no idea.

Joey: No idea? Who do you think brought her here?

Rachel: Cupid.

Phoebe: Joey, sheâs so cool. She speaks four languages.

Joey: Man, do you know what guys want!

Rachel: Look Joey, come on sheâs so perfect for you! I mean sheâs sweet, she-she likes baseball, and she-she had two beers at lunch.

Joey: My beers?! Look you guys, sheâs a very nice girl. Okay? We had a good time, but I justâI donât see it going anywhere.

Phoebe: Yeah, but you always say that.

Rachel: Yeah, maybe if you gave this girl a chance it would go somewhere.

Joey: Look Iâm sorry you guys, I-I just donât think so.

Phoebe: Whatever.

Rachel: Fine. (They start to walk away.)

Joey: Hey, donât start judging me! (To Rachel) Huh? Youâre the one whoâs in love with her assistant! (To Phoebe) Huh? And you, youâre the one having the affair with the guy who keeps the pigeons on the roof!

Rachel: Phoebe!

Phoebe: Secret affair!

[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel and Joey are there as Ross enters.]

Ross: People are doing it in front of my book!

Rachel: Iâm sorry?

Ross: My doctoral dissertation is in the library at school, I went to see it, and there were students makinâ babies right in the middle of the Paleontology section!

Rachel: Oh my God! Did you get to see anything good?

Ross: Let me ask you something, at your school was there a like uh a place on campus where students went to uh, fool around.

Rachel: Yeah, there was. It wasâthere the corner of the library where-where all these dusty books that nobody ever readâYes, there was.

Ross: Great! Because people kept showing up, I think itâs like uh-a thing!

Joey: Now hold on a second, fifth floor against that back wall?

Ross: Oh for cryinâ out loud! (He storms out.)

Joey: All right, so we should go catch our movie.

Rachel: Well now whatâs the rush?

Joey: I like to see the previews. (Rachel looks at him.) The candy.

Phoebe: (entering with Erin) Oh. Hey!

Rachel: Well look whoâs here!

Erin: Hey!

Joey: Hey!

Erin: Joey.

Joey: Erin.

Erin: Hey Rachel.

Rachel: Hi! Well, we were just about to take off and see a movie. Oh no!

Erin: Whatâs wrong?

Rachel: Oh Phoebe, we forgot that party we have to go to.

Phoebe: Oh no.

Joey: (skeptical) What party?

Phoebe and Rachel: A birthday party.

Joey: Whoâs birthday party?

Phoebe and Rachel: Allisonâs birthday party.

Joey: (still skeptical) Oh, and how is Allison?

Phoebe and Rachel: 32. (Joeyâs not buying it.)

Rachel: (does a retching sound) Wait a minute! Why donât you guys do something?!

Joey: (still skeptical) Yeah, look how that worked out.

Commercial Break

[Scene: The Library, Ross enters and heads to the desk to talk to the male librarian on duty.]

Ross: Excuse me. Hi, Iâm a professor here. Do you know the Paleontology section, fifth floor, stack 437?

The Librarian: Well, yes! Just give me five minutes, I just have to find someone to cover my shift.

Ross: No! No!! No! Can I speak to someone in charge please?! (The librarian brings his boss over.)

The Head Librarian: How can I help you?

Ross: Hi, I was wondering if it is possible to increase security in the Paleontology section? See I-I wrote a book up there and instead of reading it people are-are-are well, rolling around in front of it.

The Head Librarian: We are aware of the problem you are referring too. (He turns to look at the previous librarian.) But as far as increasing security, Iâm afraid the library is very understaffed. I, I canât help you.

Ross: Well, fine. Fine! If-if Iâm the only person with any appreciation of the sanctity of the written word, Iâll go up there and defend it myself! (Starts to do so, but stops and to the previous librarian) And donât you follow me!

[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Rachel and Phoebe are doing dishes as Joey enters.]

Joey: Hey.

Phoebe: Hey!

Rachel: How did it go with Erin?

Joey: Oh, unbelievable! We had the best time!

Phoebe: Yay!! Oh so, youâre not, youâre not mad at us anymore?

Joey: No! No! No! You guys were totally right! This is so much better than the first time we went out. Yâknow? That was so awkward, we were really nervous.

Phoebe: Didnât you sleep together?

Joey: Yeah that really calms me down. And! We have so much in common! She loves sandwiches, sports, although she is a Met fan, not much of an issue now but if were ever to have kids, well thatâs aâ¦

Rachel: (gasps) Oh my God! Listen to you talkinâ about having kids. Oh my Joey. (She goes over and hugs him.) Oh, please donât get married before I do.

Joey: Okay.

[Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Chandler are on their date with Janice and Clark, however Clark is a no show and Janice is crying the Mississippi River about it.]

Janice: Oh. Oh I just cannot believe Clark stood me up!

Monica: He might still show up.

Janice: Oh, what are you, stupid? Itâs been three hours.

Monica: Is that all?

Janice: I should just go on to happier things, okay? Umm, why donât you tell about your lovely wedding?

Chandler: Well actually uh, there was something we wanted to tell you about the wedding. Um, itâs going to be a small ceremony. Uh, tiny! Weâre not even sure why weâre having it.

Monica: Itâs actually going to be just family.

Janice: Ohâ¦waitâ¦you two think of me as family?! Oh, I have to ask you something now and be honest; do you want me to sing Careless Whisper or Lady In Red?

[Scene: Central Perk, Joey is entering and arguing baseball with Erin. Phoebe and Rachel are already there.]

Joey: How can you say that?! The Mets have no closer!

Erin: What about Benitez?

Joey: What about Game 1 of the Series?

Erin: What about shut up?

Joey: You shut up! (To Phoebe and Rachel) I love arguing with her. (To Erin) Iâll be right back.

Erin: Okay. (Joey goes to get some coffee and Erin sits down.)

Rachel: So howâs it goinâ with Joey?

Erin: Uh, okay.

Rachel: Okay? Wait okay, tell-tell me that you like him, please? I mean tell me that you like him.

Erin: Look, heâs a really great guy and I know that you really want this to work out, but I just donât see this having a future.

Rachel: But you said that you liked him! I mean what happened?! Did ya just change your mind?!

Erin: Kinda.

Phoebe: Then change it back!

Erin: Iâm sorry Iâ¦ Itâs just thereâs no real spark.

Phoebe: No spark? Didnât you sleep together?

Erin: Yeah.

Rachel: Ugh, tramp!

Phoebe: Does Joey have any idea?

Erin: I really donât think he does. And yâknow what? Maybe you guys could help clue him in. Yâknow, tell him Iâm-Iâm not interested in a serious relationship or something.

Phoebe: Yeah, you mean like that youâre kind of a loner.

Erin: Yeah! That would be great!

Phoebe: Yeah, and maybe that youâre a real (She says something in Italian, and it doesnât matter what she said. Itâs not important so I donât need everyone who speaks Italian telling me what she said.)

Erin: Iâm sorry?

Phoebe: Oh well, I guess Italian isnât one of the four languages you speak.

Joey: (returning) Hey! You wanna go?

Erin: Yeah, letâs go.

Joey: Okay. See you guys later.

Erin: Bye guys.

Rachel: Yeah, see ya.

Joey: (whispers to Phoebe and Rachel) Hey, thank you so much. (They both exit.)

Rachel: Wow. Well, I guess it was Cupid who brought her here.

Phoebe: No, just a regular old flying dwarf.

[Scene: The libraryâs Paleontology section, Ross is patrolling as a couple walks up.]

Ross: Yes? Yes?! How can I help you?

Guy: Yeah, we wereâ¦we were just looking around.

Ross: Oh-oh, youâre-youâre fellow scholars. What exactly were you looking for, hmm? Perhaps, (Grabs a book from the shelf behind him) perhaps Dr. Chester Stockâs musings on the Smiledon Californicus?

Guy: Uhhâ¦.

Ross: Ahâ¦ Ahâ¦Get out of here! (The couple retreats. Ross starts looking through the previously mentioned book as a beautiful woman walks into the section.) Uh, meeting someone? Or-or are you just here to brush up on Marionâs views on evolution?

Woman: Uh, actually I find Marionâs views far to progressionist.

Ross: I find Marionâs views far to progressionist.

Woman: Iâm sorry, who are you?

Ross: Iâm a professor here uh, Rossâ¦Geller.

Woman: Ross Geller, why do I know that name? Itâs uhâWait! (Grabs his book off of the shelf.) Did you write this?

Ross: Yes! Youâre the person who checked out my book?!

Woman: Yâknow, you look nothing like I wouldâve thought. Youâreâ¦youâre so young.

Ross: Well I uh, I skipped forth grade.

[Time Lapse, Ross and the woman are now in a state of partial undress and are standing in front of the head librarian with two security guards watching them.]

Joey: Hey!

Phoebe: Hey!

Rachel: Hi!

Phoebe: So how was, how was your date?

Joey: Oh, it was great! I mean we walked all around the village. We went to this ice cream place, split a milkshake, 70/30 but stillâ¦ And guess what, Iâm thinking about taking her upstate to one of those bed and breakfasts.

Phoebe: Oh really? She said she wants to go away with you?

Joey: No-no-no-no-no! Itâs a surprise, but itâs gonna be tricky thought because she said she was gonna be pretty busy at work for a while.

Phoebe and Rachel: Oh no, yeah.

Rachel: Jo-Joey, look honey we-we need to talk okay? Umm, I kinda got the feeling from her today that uh, sheâs not lookinâ for a serious relationship.

Joey: Where are you gettinâ this?

Rachel: Well, she told me. She said sheâs kinda a loner.

Joey: Oh. Oh.

Rachel: Joeyâ¦

Joey: No hey Rach, itâs cool okay? Yâknow Iâm a loner too! (Heads for his room.) Right?

Phoebe: Hey Joey, yâknow what? You are way to good for her.

Rachel: Yeah and honey I promise next time that I will just say good-bye and tell âem youâre not looking for a relationship.

Joey: No! No. Donât do that, just next time make sure she really likes me.

Rachel: Well that too. (Joey goes into his room.) Joey?

Joey: Yeah?

Rachel: Do you want some pancakes?

Joey: (coming back out) Finally!

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler and Monica are sitting at the kitchen table and are still trying to decide what to do about Janice.]

Monica: What are we gonna do?

Chandler: I say we go with Careless Whisper.

(Thereâs a knock on the door and Janice enters.)

Janice: Chandler?

Chandler: (To Monica) Did she see us yet? Did she see us?

Monica: Janice, what umm, what are you doing here?

Janice: Well umm, I thought I was going to go back to my apartment but then I just felt I couldnât really be alone tonight. (Joey walks into view of the open door behind Janice, sees her, gets a terrified look on his face, and flees in horror.) I was wondering if I could maybe stay here with you, just I really feel that I need to be with family.

Monica: (To Chandler) Our kids are gonna call her Aunt Janice arenât they?

Janice: Please, itâs because otherwise I really donât know what I might do.

Chandler: Arenât you just a tinsy bit curious?

Janice: (starting to cry) Do you have any tissues?

Monica: Yeah, in-in-in the bathroom.

Janice: Okay! (She runs for the bathroom)

Monica: Weâll justâ¦weâll just let her stay.

Chandler: No-no-no-no, if we let her stay, she will stay forever!

Monica: Kinda like your Barca lounger.

Chandler: Is that what youâre thinking about right now?

Monica: I never stop thinking about it.

Janice: Hey you guys, umm do either one of you want to get in there before I take my bath.

Chandler: Janice, Iâm sorry but umm, you canât stay here tonight.

Janice: Why not?

Chandler: Honestly? Our apartment is a hotbed for electromagnetic activity. Now Monica and I have been immunized, but sadly you have not.

(And she does the laugh.)

Janice: Okay, Iâm going to need a comforter, but did you have a hypoallergenic one because otherwise I get very nasal. (Makes some weird sound) Do you have a cat? âCause itâs already happening. (Makes a nasal sound) Do you hear that? (She keeps making the nasal sound.)

(Chandler does the same nasal sound to Chandler.)

Monica: Oh my God! Oh my God! You have to go!

Janice: Why?

Monica: Because Chandler still has feelings for you!

Janice: He does?

Chandler: Say again?

Monica: Thatâs right. Thatâs right. And that is why you canât stay here tonight. And probably why you shouldnât come to the wedding.

Chandler: Feelings, such strong feelings.

Monica: I mean, I realize that his feelings may never completely go away, but you can.

Janice: Ohâ¦my Gawd, I-I understand. I-I am so sorry, Iâll go. (Starts for the door.) Good-bye Monica (hugs her), I wish you a lifetime of happiness with him. Chandler, (hugs him) you call me when this goes in the pooper. (Hurries out.)

End
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is in the kitchen, Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe are sitting around the table writing one notepads while Chandler is looking over their shoulders.]

Ross: (entering) Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!

Chandler: No, no, no. No-no-no.

Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe: Shhhh!

Ross: What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?

Chandler: No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.

Ross: What? That's like insanely easy!

Chandler: Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica).

Monica: It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.

Ross: What? You forgot fourteen states?

Monica: Nobody cares about the Dakotas. (Thatâs true in so many ways, trust me, Iâve lived in one and been to the other.)

[Chandler's watch beeps]

Chandler: Oh, okay, time's up!

Rachel: All right, I got 48.

Chandler: Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?

Phoebe: Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery.

Chandler: Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead inâ¦vegetables, Joey?

Joey: Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.

Ross: Wow, how many have you got?

Joey: Fifty-six!

Opening Credits

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's. Ross is sitting in the couch doing Chandler's game. Chandler is sitting in his barca-lounger. The girls are in the kitchen.]

Joey: Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!

Chandler: Does South Oregon have a sports-team? (Joey strikes one from his list) There you go.

[Cut to the girls in the kitchen.]

Rachel: (counting the place settings) How come we have one extra place setting?

Monica: 'Cause you invited your assistant.

Rachel: Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.

Monica: Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.

Rachel: Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.

Monica: Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, (Laughs) but I still do.

Phoebe: Regular Celery! (Starts to write that on her list) Oh, I already have that. (She gets up and heads for her room)

Ross: Done! With time a-to-spare.

Chandler: Oooh that may be a New World's record (Looks at his watch and picks up Ross' pad)

Ross: You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?

Chandler: Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad)

Ross: What? That's impossible.

Joey: 46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?

Monica: All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!

Chandler: I am only one man! (Monica heads out) Okay Ross, time is up!

Ross: No, just give me another minute.

Chandler: Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.

Ross: This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.

Chandler: Okay, but if you can'tâ¦no dinner!

Ross: You're on!

Joey: (gets up) All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.

Monica: (entering, to Joey and Rachel) Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?

Joey: But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?

Monica: Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?

Ross: Pshhshhh!

Monica: Chandler? Can you give me a hand? (Grabs her jacket)

Chandler: Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.

Joey: Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.

[Chandler and Monica head out with some stuff. Phoebe comes out of her room with a bag.]

Phoebe: Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.

Ross: Phoebe, why is your bag moving?

Phoebe: Oh, it's not!

Rachel: Seriously, it's moving!

Joey: What the hell is in there?

Phoebe: It's just my knitting that's all! (A dog sticks its head out of Phoebe's bag. Everyone looks puzzled.) Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.

[Scene: Ross' apartment, Monica and Chandler enter.]

Monica: Rossâs apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?

Chandler: I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.

Monica: That's my pie!

Chandler: Which smells delicious!

Monica: Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

Chandler: What?

Monica: We left Joey alone with the food! (Walks towards the window and looks out) Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Ross is still doing his list. Rachel and Joey are feeding the dog as the phone rings.]

Phoebe: (answering the phone) Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?

Monica: Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?

Phoebe: I'm sorry, who's this?

Monica: Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!

Chandler: Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!

Phoebe: No, there's no dog here?

Monica: Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and [Cut to Monicaâs apartment] he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.

Phoebe: Oh my god! Where are you? (Looks around.)

Monica: I'll be right there!

Phoebe: (Phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. She gasps.) They're here already? How are they doing this?

Rachel: (gets up and opens the door) Hi Tag! What are you doing here?

Tag: I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.

Rachel: Well, sure! Come in! (He enters) Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?

Tag: We kinda broke up this morning.

Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry.

Tag: Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.

Ross: Ohio!! Thank you!

[Time lapse, Chandler and Monica enter.]

Chandler: Huh! Where is the dog?!

Ross: What dog? There-there's no dog here.

Joey: Yeah that dog left!

Monica: (walks to Phoebe's door) Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!

Phoebe: There's no dog in here.

[The dog barks.]

Chandler: Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!

Phoebe: No that's just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and the dog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.

Chandler: What is it doing here?

Phoebe: Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. (She bends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws) Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?

Monica: Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!

Chandler: Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!

Phoebe: That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days

Chandler: (gasping) Really?

Monica: Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?

Chandler: Well, it still has to go, right?

Monica and Phoebe: Why?

Chandler: Okay, it's umâ¦

Joey: (interrupting him) Don't do it!

Monica: Don't do what?

Chandler: (to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say, "Do what you have to do") Okay, I hate dogs.

All: What?

Phoebe: Are you crazy?

Ross: Are you out of your mind?

Phoebe: Why?

Joey: Told ya. (Waves bye-bye.)

Chandler: They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.

Ross: Right, they are scary. (He jumps up, screaming) Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!

Rachel: Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?

Chandler: (scared) Is there a puppy here?

Tag: You don't like puppies?

Chandler: (to Tag) Okay, you are new!

Joey: Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likinâ ice cream.

Phoebe: You don't like ice cream?

Ross: It's too cold.

Chandler: Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.

Ross: (to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth.

Chandler: And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. (An awkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!

[Time lapse, Ross is still doing Chandler's game. Tag is heading for the balcony.]

Ross: How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.

Monica: 1250.

Ross: Damn, I forgot you were here.

Phoebe: All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Rossâs. We'll be back in a minute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.)

Rachel: Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?

Monica: Yeah.

Rachel: When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?

Phoebe: Oh, I'd say about a month.

Monica: Really? I'd say 3 to 4.

Joey: Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)

Rachel: Interesting.

Monica: When it's your assistant, I would say never.

Joey: All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.

Rachel: Huh. A moo-point?

Joey: Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.

Rachel: (to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?

Monica: Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-heâs obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.   What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.

Rachel: You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.

Joey: Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.

[Cut to the balcony, Tag is looking down while Rachel enters.]

Rachel: Hey!

Tag: Hey.

Rachel: How are you holding up?

Tag: Not bad.

Rachel: Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

Tag: Thanks.

Rachel: So were you guys together a long time?

Tag: A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.

Rachel: Now that she broke up with you?

Tag: Yeah.

Rachel: Yeah. Hmmmm.

Tag: It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?

Rachel: Noâ¦Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure itâ¦it has to work out.

Tag: Why?

Rachel: Because, uhâit has to.

Tag: You have all the answers, don't you?

Rachel: Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.

Tag: Hey, thanks for talking to me.

Rachel: Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! (They hug)

Joey: (through the window) All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!

Tag: What?

Joey: (realizes what he said) Street noise drowned any of that out? (Rachel moves madly towards him) No, all right, I see you later, okay... (Turns away embarrassed)

Commercial Break

[Scene: The Balcony, continued from earlier.]

Tag: What did Joey say? I like you back?

Rachel: Uh, yeah, well, see, heâ¦ Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, andâ¦you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!

Tag: Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.

Rachel: No? (He shakes his head) All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.

Tag: Wow. (He starts to walk towards the railing.)

Rachel: Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.

Tag: (looking at the street) Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car! (He points down to the street)

Rachel: What?

Tag: Right there! That's my car! (Sound of a breaking car-window) Hey!!

Rachel: Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?

Tag: I can't believe this! (He walks back in again)

Rachel: (she hurries after him) Wait, we still have time to talk and theyâre-they're not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Oh look, there they go, okay. (She hurries in, too)

[Scene: Ross' apartment, Monica and Phoebe sitting on the floor next to Clunkers basket.]

Monica: Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.

Phoebe: (doing Clunkers) Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.

Monica: Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.

Phoebe: Yeah, okay.

[They both get up and head for the door. Clunkers whines a little]

Monica: Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! (She goes back to Clunkers again) Oooh, I can't leave her!

Phoebe: You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.

Monica: That's not gonna work.

Phoebe: I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.

Monica: Hey! I didn't know either.

Phoebe: Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?

Monica: Yeah, I knew.

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's. Ross lays a lot off small papers, shaped like the U.S. states onto the floor making a map with the states. Phoebe enters]

Phoebe: Where's Chandler?

Chandler: (comes out of the bathroom) Here I am.

Phoebe: Wash your hands!!!

Chandler: How did youâ¦know? (Heads back into the bathroom)

[Phoebe waves Monica in. Monica sneaks in with the bag with Clunkers in it and heads for Phoebe's room.]

Ross: Hey! What's she doing back here?

Monica: Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!

Ross: Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...

Phoebe: (interrupts him) No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.

Ross: Yeah, but, but look what I'm...

Phoebe: See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. (She rushes into her room)

Chandler: (comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica?

Ross: Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.

Chandler: Why not?

(We can hear the dog whining at a high pitch.)

Ross: Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.

Chandler: Well, I, I should go in there.

Ross: No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.

Chandler: Why not?

Ross: Because you sent away the dog!

Chandler: This is ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom)

Ross: Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friendâ¦Phyllisâ¦take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.

Joey: (entering) Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees that Chandler has a worried look on his face) What's the matter?

Chandler: Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.

Joey: So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.

Chandler: Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?

Joey: Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.

Chandler: And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out)

Joey: Ross, you need some help?

Ross: From you? (He does a weird desperate laughter, like he's almost crying) Yes, please!

Joey: (sits down next to Ross) First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!

[Time lapse, Ross still laying a lot out the states.]

Ross: I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.

[Joey stands up again. Rachel enters the door]

Joey: Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.

Rachel: Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? (In a girlish voice) I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. (Back to normal again) Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out

Joey: If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.

[Rachel walks past Joey towards the couch]

Phoebe: (opens her bedroom door and peeks out) Hey, is Chandler here?

Chandler: No, no he went for a walk.

Phoebe: Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!

[The dog barks, runs out of Phoebe's room and jumps onto the couch]

Rachel: (gasps) Hi!

Joey: Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!

Phoebe: Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!

Joey: You think?

[The door opens and Chandler comes in. Rachel covers the door with a blanket]

Monica: Hi, honey.

Chandler: Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.

Monica: What? Why, why would...

Phoebe: (interrupts her, to Monica) Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.

Chandler: Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Yâknow, for you, andâ¦(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. (Points up and then over to the street)

Phoebe: We have good news, look whose back!

Rachel: (uncovers the dog) Hi!

Chandler: Clunkers?! Oh my god!

Monica: That's right, she came back all by herself.

Phoebe: It's a Thanksgiving miracle!

Chandler: (to Clunkers) It is so good to see you!

Phoebe: Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her inâ¦(Realizes, that Chandler starts to not believing her) I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?

[Time lapse, after dinner. Ross stands up from his self-made map.]

Ross: Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.

Chandler: It's up to you.

[Ross whines and starts working again. The door opens and Tag enters.]

Rachel: Oh, hi! How are you doing?

Tag: I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.

Rachel: Oh.

Tag: Thanks for having me over, you guys.

Ross: Tag? Y-You're going? (Comes over to Tag) Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?

Tag: Colorado.

Ross: Ah, what good are you. (Walks back to his map dejectedly.)

[Rachel and Tag go into the hall.]

Rachel: Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.

Tag: Okay.

Rachel: Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. Itâyâknow what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?

Tag: Um, I'm not.

Rachel: Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.

Tag: No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.

Rachel: Really?

Tag: Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this. (He kisses her)

Rachel: Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.

Ending Credits

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, later that night, there is someone knocking on the door and Chandler stumbles out into the living room, turns on the light, looks through the peephole, and opens the door.]

Ross: Delaware! (Starting to cry.) Delaware!

Chandler: All right.

Ross: (hands Chandler his pad and walks in) I want my turkey now!

Chandler: You got it. (Starts looking at the pad, while Ross got the turkey out of the fridge and starts to unwrap and it) You got Nevada twice.

Ross: (pauses) I know.

Chandler: Yeah. (Throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)

End
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is in the kitchen, Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe are sitting around the table writing one notepads while Chandler is looking over their shoulders.]

Ross: (entering) Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!

Chandler: No, no, no. No-no-no.

Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe: Shhhh!

Ross: What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?

Chandler: No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.

Ross: What? That's like insanely easy!

Chandler: Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica).

Monica: It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.

Ross: What? You forgot fourteen states?

Monica: Nobody cares about the Dakotas. (Thatâs true in so many ways, trust me, Iâve lived in one and been to the other.)

[Chandler's watch beeps]

Chandler: Oh, okay, time's up!

Rachel: All right, I got 48.

Chandler: Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?

Phoebe: Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery.

Chandler: Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead inâ¦vegetables, Joey?

Joey: Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.

Ross: Wow, how many have you got?

Joey: Fifty-six!

Opening Credits

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's. Ross is sitting in the couch doing Chandler's game. Chandler is sitting in his barca-lounger. The girls are in the kitchen.]

Joey: Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!

Chandler: Does South Oregon have a sports-team? (Joey strikes one from his list) There you go.

[Cut to the girls in the kitchen.]

Rachel: (counting the place settings) How come we have one extra place setting?

Monica: 'Cause you invited your assistant.

Rachel: Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.

Monica: Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.

Rachel: Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.

Monica: Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, (Laughs) but I still do.

Phoebe: Regular Celery! (Starts to write that on her list) Oh, I already have that. (She gets up and heads for her room)

Ross: Done! With time a-to-spare.

Chandler: Oooh that may be a New World's record (Looks at his watch and picks up Ross' pad)

Ross: You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?

Chandler: Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad)

Ross: What? That's impossible.

Joey: 46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?

Monica: All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!

Chandler: I am only one man! (Monica heads out) Okay Ross, time is up!

Ross: No, just give me another minute.

Chandler: Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.

Ross: This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.

Chandler: Okay, but if you can'tâ¦no dinner!

Ross: You're on!

Joey: (gets up) All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.

Monica: (entering, to Joey and Rachel) Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?

Joey: But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?

Monica: Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?

Ross: Pshhshhh!

Monica: Chandler? Can you give me a hand? (Grabs her jacket)

Chandler: Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.

Joey: Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.

[Chandler and Monica head out with some stuff. Phoebe comes out of her room with a bag.]

Phoebe: Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.

Ross: Phoebe, why is your bag moving?

Phoebe: Oh, it's not!

Rachel: Seriously, it's moving!

Joey: What the hell is in there?

Phoebe: It's just my knitting that's all! (A dog sticks its head out of Phoebe's bag. Everyone looks puzzled.) Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.

[Scene: Ross' apartment, Monica and Chandler enter.]

Monica: Rossâs apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?

Chandler: I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.

Monica: That's my pie!

Chandler: Which smells delicious!

Monica: Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

Chandler: What?

Monica: We left Joey alone with the food! (Walks towards the window and looks out) Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Ross is still doing his list. Rachel and Joey are feeding the dog as the phone rings.]

Phoebe: (answering the phone) Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?

Monica: Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?

Phoebe: I'm sorry, who's this?

Monica: Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!

Chandler: Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!

Phoebe: No, there's no dog here?

Monica: Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and [Cut to Monicaâs apartment] he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.

Phoebe: Oh my god! Where are you? (Looks around.)

Monica: I'll be right there!

Phoebe: (Phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. She gasps.) They're here already? How are they doing this?

Rachel: (gets up and opens the door) Hi Tag! What are you doing here?

Tag: I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.

Rachel: Well, sure! Come in! (He enters) Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?

Tag: We kinda broke up this morning.

Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry.

Tag: Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.

Ross: Ohio!! Thank you!

[Time lapse, Chandler and Monica enter.]

Chandler: Huh! Where is the dog?!

Ross: What dog? There-there's no dog here.

Joey: Yeah that dog left!

Monica: (walks to Phoebe's door) Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!

Phoebe: There's no dog in here.

[The dog barks.]

Chandler: Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!

Phoebe: No that's just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and the dog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.

Chandler: What is it doing here?

Phoebe: Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. (She bends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws) Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?

Monica: Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!

Chandler: Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!

Phoebe: That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days

Chandler: (gasping) Really?

Monica: Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?

Chandler: Well, it still has to go, right?

Monica and Phoebe: Why?

Chandler: Okay, it's umâ¦

Joey: (interrupting him) Don't do it!

Monica: Don't do what?

Chandler: (to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say, "Do what you have to do") Okay, I hate dogs.

All: What?

Phoebe: Are you crazy?

Ross: Are you out of your mind?

Phoebe: Why?

Joey: Told ya. (Waves bye-bye.)

Chandler: They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.

Ross: Right, they are scary. (He jumps up, screaming) Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!

Rachel: Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?

Chandler: (scared) Is there a puppy here?

Tag: You don't like puppies?

Chandler: (to Tag) Okay, you are new!

Joey: Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likinâ ice cream.

Phoebe: You don't like ice cream?

Ross: It's too cold.

Chandler: Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.

Ross: (to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth.

Chandler: And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. (An awkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!

[Time lapse, Ross is still doing Chandler's game. Tag is heading for the balcony.]

Ross: How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.

Monica: 1250.

Ross: Damn, I forgot you were here.

Phoebe: All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Rossâs. We'll be back in a minute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.)

Rachel: Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?

Monica: Yeah.

Rachel: When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?

Phoebe: Oh, I'd say about a month.

Monica: Really? I'd say 3 to 4.

Joey: Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)

Rachel: Interesting.

Joey: All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.

Rachel: Huh. A moo-point?

Joey: Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.

Rachel: (to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?

Monica: Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-heâs obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.   What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.

Rachel: You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.

Joey: Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.

[Cut to the balcony, Tag is looking down while Rachel enters.]

Rachel: Hey!

Tag: Hey.

Rachel: How are you holding up?

Tag: Not bad.

Rachel: Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

Tag: Thanks.

Rachel: So were you guys together a long time?

Tag: A year. On and off. I kinda thought we'd end up together. I don't anymore.

Rachel: Now that she broke up with you?

Tag: Yeah.

Rachel: Yeah. Hmmmm.

Tag: It's weird. I always used to assume, that I would meet someone and fall in love and be happy and all that was just a given. But lately it's like what if it's not. Do you ever have that feeling?

Rachel: Noâ¦Yeah, all the time, constantly. It's terrifying. But you know that I figure itâ¦it has to work out.

Tag: Why?

Rachel: Because, uhâit has to.

Tag: You have all the answers, don't you?

Rachel: Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.

Tag: Hey, thanks for talking to me.

Rachel: Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! (They hug)

Joey: (through the window) All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!

Tag: What?

Joey: (realizes what he said) Street noise drowned any of that out? (Rachel moves madly towards him) No, all right, I see you later, okay... (Turns away embarrassed)

Commercial Break

[Scene: The Balcony, continued from earlier.]

Tag: What did Joey say? I like you back?

Rachel: Uh, yeah, well, see, heâ¦ Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, andâ¦you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!

Tag: Wait-wait a minute; that doesn't make any sense.

Rachel: No? (He shakes his head) All right, here's the truth um, Joey said what he said, because um, I'm attracted to you.

Tag: Wow. (He starts to walk towards the railing.)

Rachel: Yeah, I admit it. I have a crush on you, and uh, and, and I know that's crazy because we work together, and-and nothing could ever happen, and the last thing I want to do is-is to freak you out or make you feel uncomfortable. Which is why it would be really great if you said something right about now.

Tag: (looking at the street) Oh my god! Those guys are stealing my car! (He points down to the street)

Rachel: What?

Tag: Right there! That's my car! (Sound of a breaking car-window) Hey!!

Rachel: Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?

Tag: I can't believe this! (He walks back in again)

Rachel: (she hurries after him) Wait, we still have time to talk and theyâre-they're not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Oh look, there they go, okay. (She hurries in, too)

[Scene: Ross' apartment, Monica and Phoebe sitting on the floor next to Clunkers basket.]

Monica: Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.

Phoebe: (doing Clunkers) Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.

Monica: Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.

Phoebe: Yeah, okay.

[They both get up and head for the door. Clunkers whines a little]

Monica: Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! (She goes back to Clunkers again) Oooh, I can't leave her!

Phoebe: You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.

Monica: That's not gonna work.

Phoebe: I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.

Monica: Hey! I didn't know either.

Phoebe: Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?

Monica: Yeah, I knew.

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's. Ross lays a lot off small papers, shaped like the U.S. states onto the floor making a map with the states. Phoebe enters]

Phoebe: Where's Chandler?

Chandler: (comes out of the bathroom) Here I am.

Phoebe: Wash your hands!!!

Chandler: How did youâ¦know? (Heads back into the bathroom)

[Phoebe waves Monica in. Monica sneaks in with the bag with Clunkers in it and heads for Phoebe's room.]

Ross: Hey! What's she doing back here?

Monica: Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!

Ross: Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...

Phoebe: (interrupts him) No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.

Ross: Yeah, but, but look what I'm...

Phoebe: See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. (She rushes into her room)

Chandler: (comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica?

Ross: Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.

Chandler: Why not?

(We can hear the dog whining at a high pitch.)

Ross: Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.

Chandler: Well, I, I should go in there.

Ross: No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.

Chandler: Why not?

Ross: Because you sent away the dog!

Chandler: This is ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom)

Ross: Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friendâ¦Phyllisâ¦take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.

Joey: (entering) Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees that Chandler has a worried look on his face) What's the matter?

Chandler: Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.

Joey: So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.

Chandler: Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?

Joey: Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.

Chandler: And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out)

Joey: Ross, you need some help?

Ross: From you? (He does a weird desperate laughter, like he's almost crying) Yes, please!

Joey: (sits down next to Ross) First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!

[Time lapse, Ross still laying a lot out the states.]

Ross: I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.

[Joey stands up again. Rachel enters the door]

Joey: Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.

Rachel: Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? (In a girlish voice) I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. (Back to normal again) Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out

Joey: If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.

[Rachel walks past Joey towards the couch]

Phoebe: (opens her bedroom door and peeks out) Hey, is Chandler here?

Chandler: No, no he went for a walk.

Phoebe: Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!

[The dog barks, runs out of Phoebe's room and jumps onto the couch]

Rachel: (gasps) Hi!

Joey: Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!

Phoebe: Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!

Joey: You think?

[The door opens and Chandler comes in. Rachel covers the door with a blanket]

Monica: Hi, honey.

Chandler: Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.

Monica: What? Why, why would...

Phoebe: (interrupts her, to Monica) Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.

Chandler: Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Yâknow, for you, andâ¦(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. (Points up and then over to the street)

Phoebe: We have good news, look whose back!

Rachel: (uncovers the dog) Hi!

Chandler: Clunkers?! Oh my god!

Monica: That's right, she came back all by herself.

Phoebe: It's a Thanksgiving miracle!

Chandler: (to Clunkers) It is so good to see you!

Phoebe: Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her inâ¦(Realizes, that Chandler starts to not believing her) I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?

[Time lapse, after dinner. Ross stands up from his self-made map.]

Ross: Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.

Chandler: It's up to you.

[Ross whines and starts working again. The door opens and Tag enters.]

Rachel: Oh, hi! How are you doing?

Tag: I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.

Rachel: Oh.

Tag: Thanks for having me over, you guys.

Ross: Tag? Y-You're going? (Comes over to Tag) Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?

Tag: Colorado.

Ross: Ah, what good are you. (Walks back to his map dejectedly.)

[Rachel and Tag go into the hall.]

Rachel: Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.

Tag: Okay.

Rachel: Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. Itâyâknow what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?

Tag: Um, I'm not.

Rachel: Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.

Tag: No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.

Rachel: Really?

Tag: Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this. (He kisses her)

Rachel: Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.

Ending Credits

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, later that night, there is someone knocking on the door and Chandler stumbles out into the living room, turns on the light, looks through the peephole, and opens the door.]

Ross: Delaware! (Starting to cry.) Delaware!

Chandler: All right.

Ross: (hands Chandler his pad and walks in) I want my turkey now!

Chandler: You got it. (Starts looking at the pad, while Ross got the turkey out of the fridge and starts to unwrap and it) You got Nevada twice.

Ross: (pauses) I know.

Chandler: Yeah. (Throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)

End
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is in the kitchen, Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe are sitting around the table writing one notepads while Chandler is looking over their shoulders.]

Ross: (entering) Hey everybody! Happy Thanksgiving!

Chandler: No, no, no. No-no-no.

Joey, Rachel, and Phoebe: Shhhh!

Ross: What, are we keeping Thanksgiving a secret this year?

Chandler: No, we're playing this game I learned at work. You have to name all the states in six minutes.

Ross: What? That's like insanely easy!

Chandler: Now, that's a lot harder than it sounds. You always forget at least one, or in some cases... fourteen (looks over to Monica).

Monica: It's a stupid game and I wasn't playing against other people, so technically I didn't lose.

Ross: What? You forgot fourteen states?

Monica: Nobody cares about the Dakotas. (Thatâs true in so many ways, trust me, Iâve lived in one and been to the other.)

[Chandler's watch beeps]

Chandler: Oh, okay, time's up!

Rachel: All right, I got 48.

Chandler: Oh that's not bad, Pheebs?

Phoebe: Oh, I got tired of naming states. So I decided to list the types of celery, and I have one: regular celery.

Chandler: Okay, so Rachel's got 48 and Phoebe has the lead inâ¦vegetables, Joey?

Joey: Say hello to the new champ of Chandler's dumb states game.

Ross: Wow, how many have you got?

Joey: Fifty-six!

Opening Credits

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's. Ross is sitting in the couch doing Chandler's game. Chandler is sitting in his barca-lounger. The girls are in the kitchen.]

Joey: Hey! How is New England not a state? Huh? They have a sports-team!

Chandler: Does South Oregon have a sports-team? (Joey strikes one from his list) There you go.

[Cut to the girls in the kitchen.]

Rachel: (counting the place settings) How come we have one extra place setting?

Monica: 'Cause you invited your assistant.

Rachel: Oh, right. Sorry. But Tag's not coming; his girlfriend came into town, so he's spending Thanksgiving with her.

Monica: Oh! Why didn't you tell me? I made him his own individual sweet potato stuffed pumpkin.

Rachel: Well, I was going to, but then I figured, you know... you're food is so delicious and perfect, you can never have too many of those pumpkin things.

Monica: Now you think I wouldn't enjoy that, because it is so fake, (Laughs) but I still do.

Phoebe: Regular Celery! (Starts to write that on her list) Oh, I already have that. (She gets up and heads for her room)

Ross: Done! With time a-to-spare.

Chandler: Oooh that may be a New World's record (Looks at his watch and picks up Ross' pad)

Ross: You know, I hate to lecture you guys, but it's kinda disgraceful, that a group of well-educated adults and Joey can't name all the states. Did you ever see a map, or one of those round, colorful things called "a globe?" Hmm?

Chandler: Uh, Magellan? You got 46 states. (Smiles and hands Ross back his pad)

Ross: What? That's impossible.

Joey: 46. Wow! Who's well educated now, Mr. I-forgot-ten-states?

Monica: All right, I'm out of oven space. I'm gonna turn on Joey's. Please, watch him! Do not let Joey eat any of the food!

Chandler: I am only one man! (Monica heads out) Okay Ross, time is up!

Ross: No, just give me another minute.

Chandler: Look Ross, if you don't know them by now, you will never know them, okay? That is the beauty of this game. It makes you want to kill yourself.

Ross: This-this is crazy! I can do this! All right, uhh, I bet I can get all 50 before dinner.

Chandler: Okay, but if you can'tâ¦no dinner!

Ross: You're on!

Joey: (gets up) All right. Don't look at my list, Ross, 'cause there's a lot on there that you don't have.

Monica: (entering, to Joey and Rachel) Hey, did you guys know, that your oven doesn't work?

Joey: But the drawer full of take-out menus is okay, right?

Monica: Ross, I'm gonna use yours, okay?

Ross: Pshhshhh!

Monica: Chandler? Can you give me a hand? (Grabs her jacket)

Chandler: Sure, and Joey; do not let Ross look at any of the maps or the globe in your apartment.

Joey: Don't worry, Chandler, it's not a globe of the United States.

[Chandler and Monica head out with some stuff. Phoebe comes out of her room with a bag.]

Phoebe: Hey you guys I'm gonna go out and take a walk.

Ross: Phoebe, why is your bag moving?

Phoebe: Oh, it's not!

Rachel: Seriously, it's moving!

Joey: What the hell is in there?

Phoebe: It's just my knitting that's all! (A dog sticks its head out of Phoebe's bag. Everyone looks puzzled.) Yes! I knit this. I'm very good.

[Scene: Ross' apartment, Monica and Chandler enter.]

Monica: Rossâs apartment is nice! How come we don't hang out here more often?

Chandler: I don't know. Maybe it's because it smells a little weird. It's like old pumpkins or something.

Monica: That's my pie!

Chandler: Which smells delicious!

Monica: Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

Chandler: What?

Monica: We left Joey alone with the food! (Walks towards the window and looks out) Yep! Yep, I knew it! There he is... feeding stuffing to a dog!

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Ross is still doing his list. Rachel and Joey are feeding the dog as the phone rings.]

Phoebe: (answering the phone) Hi Geller-Bing residence. How can I help?

Monica: Phoebe, why is there a dog in our apartment?

Phoebe: I'm sorry, who's this?

Monica: Phoebe, there's a dog sitting on my couch!

Chandler: Tell her, I'm allergic, and I will sue!

Phoebe: No, there's no dog here?

Monica: Yes there is! He's black and white and shaggy and [Cut to Monicaâs apartment] he's sitting next to Rachel and licking Rachel's hand.

Phoebe: Oh my god! Where are you? (Looks around.)

Monica: I'll be right there!

Phoebe: (Phoebe hangs up and someone knocks on the door. She gasps.) They're here already? How are they doing this?

Rachel: (gets up and opens the door) Hi Tag! What are you doing here?

Tag: I, uh, wanted to see if your offer to spend Thanksgiving with you is still good.

Rachel: Well, sure! Come in! (He enters) Well, what-what happened to your girlfriend?

Tag: We kinda broke up this morning.

Rachel: Oh, I'm sorry.

Tag: Yeah, so she went back to Ohio.

Ross: Ohio!! Thank you!

[Time lapse, Chandler and Monica enter.]

Chandler: Huh! Where is the dog?!

Ross: What dog? There-there's no dog here.

Joey: Yeah that dog left!

Monica: (walks to Phoebe's door) Phoebe! Phoebe, open up!

Phoebe: There's no dog in here.

[The dog barks.]

Chandler: Phoebe, we can hear the dog barking!

Phoebe: No that's just me coughing! (Doing some weird coughing noises and the dog barks again. Phoebe comes out of the room.) Oh, good, there you are! Listen, um, I have a dog in my room.

Chandler: What is it doing here?

Phoebe: Well, I'm watching it for some friends who went out of town. Wait. (She bends down, picks up the dog, and waves with one of its paws) Hello, my name is Clunkers. May I please stay with you nice people?

Monica: Oooh, I wish she could stay here, but Chandler is allergic!

Chandler: Extremely allergic, okay? If I'm anywhere near a dog for more than 5 minutes, my throat will just close up!

Phoebe: That's odd, 'cause this dog's been living here for the past 3 days

Chandler: (gasping) Really?

Monica: Chandler, if that dog's been here that long, and you haven't had a reaction, maybe you're not allergic to this dog?

Chandler: Well, it still has to go, right?

Monica and Phoebe: Why?

Chandler: Okay, it's umâ¦

Joey: (interrupting him) Don't do it!

Monica: Don't do what?

Chandler: (to Joey) I have to! Okay? It's time! (Joey shrugs as if to say, "Do what you have to do") Okay, I hate dogs.

All: What?

Phoebe: Are you crazy?

Ross: Are you out of your mind?

Phoebe: Why?

Joey: Told ya. (Waves bye-bye.)

Chandler: They are needy, they are jumpy, and you can't tell what they are thinking, and that scares me a little bit.

Ross: Right, they are scary. (He jumps up, screaming) Ahh, she just ate a treat out of my hand!!!

Rachel: Wait a minute. Do you not like all dogs? I mean, not even puppies?

Chandler: (scared) Is there a puppy here?

Tag: You don't like puppies?

Chandler: (to Tag) Okay, you are new!

Joey: Look, Chandler, I told you, never tell anyone about this dog thing. It's like Ross not likinâ ice cream.

Phoebe: You don't like ice cream?

Ross: It's too cold.

Chandler: Okay, it's just that dogs make me a little uncomfortable.

Ross: (to Phoebe) It hurts my teeth.

Chandler: And I don't wanna say this, I don't you guys to hate me, but uh, I don't think, I can be around that dog anymore. Okay, so either the dog goes, or I go. (An awkward silence ensues.) Oh my god!!

[Time lapse, Ross is still doing Chandler's game. Tag is heading for the balcony.]

Ross: How can I not get this? I'm a college professor; I got 1450 on my S.A.T.s.

Monica: 1250.

Ross: Damn, I forgot you were here.

Phoebe: All right. We're gonna take Clunkers to Rossâs. We'll be back in a minute. (Gets up with Monica to do so.)

Rachel: Oh, wait before you guys go, can I just ask you a question?

Monica: Yeah.

Rachel: When a guy breaks up with his girlfriend, what is an appropriate amount of time to wait before you make a move?

Phoebe: Oh, I'd say about a month.

Monica: Really? I'd say 3 to 4.

Joey: Half hour. (Rachel turns to look at him and he nods yes.)

Rachel: Interesting.

Monica: When it's your assistant, I would say never.

Joey: All right, Rach, the big question is, does he like you? All right? Because if he doesn't like you, this is all a moo-point.

Rachel: Huh. A moo-point?

Joey: Yeah, it's like a cow's opinion. It just doesn't matter. It's moo.

Rachel: (to Monica and Phoebe) Have I been living with him for too long, or did that all just make sense?

Monica: Please, don't listen to Joey, okay. Would you look at him? He-heâs obviously depressed. He's away from his family; he's spending Thanksgiving with strangers.   What he needs right now is for you to be his friend.

Rachel: You're right, I'm sorry. Thank you. Okay, that's what I'm gonna do.

Joey: Fine! Take their advice. No one ever listens to me. When the package is this pretty, no one cares what's inside.

[Cut to the balcony, Tag is looking down while Rachel enters.]

Rachel: Hey!

Tag: Hey.

Rachel: How are you holding up?

Tag: Not bad.

Rachel: Yeah? I'm sorry about your girlfriend.

Rachel: Because, uhâit has to.

Tag: You have all the answers, don't you?

Rachel: Yeah, I know, I do. I really do.

Tag: Hey, thanks for talking to me.

Rachel: Well, what is a boss for? Hug it out! (They hug)

Joey: (through the window) All right, he likes you back! Huh? Told ya, you should go for it!

Commercial Break

[Scene: The Balcony, continued from earlier.]

Tag: What did Joey say? I like you back?

Rachel: Uh, yeah, well, see, heâ¦ Joey knows, that I'm-I'm very insecure about my back and, andâ¦you're hugging me, so obviously you are not repulsed by it, yeah!

Rachel: What?

Tag: Right there! That's my car! (Sound of a breaking car-window) Hey!!

Rachel: Okay, that's gonna take them a minute. Do you have anything else you wanna get off your chest?

Tag: I can't believe this! (He walks back in again)

Rachel: (she hurries after him) Wait, we still have time to talk and theyâre-they're not even in the car yet! (She takes a quick look down the street.) Oh look, there they go, okay. (She hurries in, too)

[Scene: Ross' apartment, Monica and Phoebe sitting on the floor next to Clunkers basket.]

Monica: Okay Phoebe, we should probably go back now.

Phoebe: (doing Clunkers) Please don't leave me, I'll be lonely.

Monica: Stop it. Stop! Okay let's go. We can be strong.

Phoebe: Yeah, okay.

[They both get up and head for the door. Clunkers whines a little]

Monica: Oh my god! Did you hear that? She said Monica! (She goes back to Clunkers again) Oooh, I can't leave her!

Phoebe: You know if you want, we can sneak the dog back in and Chandler wouldn't even know.

Monica: That's not gonna work.

Phoebe: I've had that dog there for three days and Chandler had no idea. He's not so smart.

Monica: Hey! I didn't know either.

Phoebe: Yeah, but you kinda knew that something was going on, didn't you?

Monica: Yeah, I knew.

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's. Ross lays a lot off small papers, shaped like the U.S. states onto the floor making a map with the states. Phoebe enters]

Phoebe: Where's Chandler?

Chandler: (comes out of the bathroom) Here I am.

Phoebe: Wash your hands!!!

Chandler: How did youâ¦know? (Heads back into the bathroom)

[Phoebe waves Monica in. Monica sneaks in with the bag with Clunkers in it and heads for Phoebe's room.]

Ross: Hey! What's she doing back here?

Monica: Relax, Ross. She's not made of ice cream!

Ross: Hey look, Phoebe. I, uh, I laid out the states geographically...

Phoebe: (interrupts him) No, no, we don't really have time for this right now. Okay, we have to keep Chandler away from my bedroom.

Ross: Yeah, but, but look what I'm...

Phoebe: See, this is exactly what we do not have time for. (She rushes into her room)

Chandler: (comes out of the bathroom) Where's Monica?

Ross: Um, in Phoebe's room. You can't go in there.

Chandler: Why not?

(We can hear the dog whining at a high pitch.)

Ross: Monica's crying. She's very upset about this whole Clunkers thing.

Chandler: Well, I, I should go in there.

Ross: No. No, no. She doesn't want to see you right now.

Chandler: Why not?

Ross: Because you sent away the dog!

Chandler: This is ridiculous. (He heads for Phoebe's bedroom)

Ross: Oh, is it? Is it? Look, when Monica and I were kids, we had a dog named Rover. And, uh, one day, my dad decides, he doesn't like dogs. So Monica and her friendâ¦Phyllisâ¦take away the dog. And that was the last time we ever saw him. Don't you see? This is just like that. Only with a few details changed.

Joey: (entering) Okay, I'm in my sweat pants. Bring on the food! (Sees that Chandler has a worried look on his face) What's the matter?

Chandler: Monica's all upset, because I sent Clunkers away.

Joey: So? Bring the dog back, you're a hero.

Chandler: Yeah, I can be a hero, I could do that. I could, I could do... I, w-w-what if, what if it attacks me?

Joey: Chandler, it's like a big gerbil.

Chandler: And that doesn't scare you? (He walks out)

Joey: Ross, you need some help?

Ross: From you? (He does a weird desperate laughter, like he's almost crying) Yes, please!

Joey: (sits down next to Ross) First of all, Utah? Dude, you can't just make stuff up!

[Time lapse, Ross still laying a lot out the states.]

Ross: I hate America! When I finish this game, I swear I am moving.

[Joey stands up again. Rachel enters the door]

Joey: Hey! Tag's still talking to the police.

Rachel: Yeah, ohh! Why, damnit, why did I open my mouth? (In a girlish voice) I have a crush on you; I am attracted to you. (Back to normal again) Gee, I-I know that I freaked him out

Joey: If you said it like that, you probably did, yeah.

[Rachel walks past Joey towards the couch]

Phoebe: (opens her bedroom door and peeks out) Hey, is Chandler here?

Chandler: No, no he went for a walk.

Phoebe: Okay, but you cannot tell him... but look whose back!

[The dog barks, runs out of Phoebe's room and jumps onto the couch]

Rachel: (gasps) Hi!

Joey: Oh No-no-no-no-no-no-no! He went over to Ross' to bring the dog back here!

Phoebe: Oh no, the dog's not going to be there!

Joey: You think?

[The door opens and Chandler comes in. Rachel covers the door with a blanket]

Monica: Hi, honey.

Chandler: Please, please, please, don't be mad at me.

Monica: What? Why, why would...

Phoebe: (interrupts her, to Monica) Shh, wait and see. Maybe we will, maybe we won't.

Chandler: Okay, I went over to Ross' apartment to bring back Clunkers. Yâknow, for you, andâ¦(Clears his throat) I left the door open and she must have gotten out and I looked everywhere, all over the apartment, including the roof, which FYI Ross, one of your neighbors, growing weed. I couldn't find him, and I am so, so, so, sorry. But I do know where we could all go ease the pain. (Points up and then over to the street)

Phoebe: We have good news, look whose back!

Rachel: (uncovers the dog) Hi!

Chandler: Clunkers?! Oh my god!

Monica: That's right, she came back all by herself.

Phoebe: It's a Thanksgiving miracle!

Chandler: (to Clunkers) It is so good to see you!

Phoebe: Yeah, she came all the way back from Ross' building. Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her inâ¦(Realizes, that Chandler starts to not believing her) I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?

[Time lapse, after dinner. Ross stands up from his self-made map.]

Ross: Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.

Chandler: It's up to you.

[Ross whines and starts working again. The door opens and Tag enters.]

Rachel: Oh, hi! How are you doing?

Tag: I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.

Rachel: Oh.

Tag: Thanks for having me over, you guys.

Ross: Tag? Y-You're going? (Comes over to Tag) Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk. Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?

Tag: Colorado.

Ross: Ah, what good are you. (Walks back to his map dejectedly.)

[Rachel and Tag go into the hall.]

Rachel: Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.

Tag: Okay.

Rachel: Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. Itâyâknow what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?

Tag: Um, I'm not.

Rachel: Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.

Tag: No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.

Rachel: Really?

Tag: Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this. (He kisses her)

Rachel: Okay, well, that's one less thing we have to do on Monday.

Ending Credits

[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, later that night, there is someone knocking on the door and Chandler stumbles out into the living room, turns on the light, looks through the peephole, and opens the door.]

Ross: Delaware! (Starting to cry.) Delaware!

Chandler: All right.

Ross: (hands Chandler his pad and walks in) I want my turkey now!

Chandler: You got it. (Starts looking at the pad, while Ross got the turkey out of the fridge and starts to unwrap and it) You got Nevada twice.

Ross: (pauses) I know.

Chandler: Yeah. (Throws the pad on the table and heads for the bedroom)
