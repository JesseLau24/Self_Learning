[Scene: The Wedding Hall, Monica and Chandler have just said "I do," and the photographer is taking the required pictures. First of Monica, Chandler, Ross and Joey.]

Photographer: Great. (Takes a picture.) Great! Just give me a sec to change film.

Monica: Okay.

Ross: (To Monica) Okay, I know Iâm not supposed to know, but I do. And Iâm so excited for you!

Joey: What? Whatâs going on?

Ross: Monicaâs pregnant!

Joey: Oh my God! Is that why you guys had to get married?!

Monica: Guys! Iâm not pregnant.

Joey: Ah. (To Chandler) Slow swimmers? (Chandler looks at him.)

Ross: What?! What do you mean? You-you-youâre not pregnant?

Monica: You didnât tell anybody I was did you?!

Ross: No! (Pause) Iâll be right back. (Exits.)

Photographer: Now why donât we get a shot of just Monica and the bloody soldier.

Monica: (To Joey) Oh, about that. Joey, you have to change before the party.

Joey: I canât! I-I donât have any other clothes here.

Monica: Find some! Please! Anything that doesnât say I-I died tragically in France. (Joey leaves to find clothes.)

Photographer: Well then why donât we see the bride and the groom and the bridemaids.

Phoebe: Okay. (Phoebe and Rachel join Monica and Chandler on the altar.) Hey Mon, why did you tell the guys you werenât pregnant?

Monica: Because Iâm not.

Phoebe: We found your test in the trash, if youâre not pregnantâ(She sees Rachel shaking her head)âItâs because I am.

(Flash, the photographer takes a picture of Monica and Chandlerâs stunned faces.)

Chandler: What?! What are you talking about?

Monica: What are you talking about?

Phoebe: Yes, Iâ¦I am with child. (Flash) And I didnât want to say anything because itâs your day; I didnât want to steal your thunder.

Monica: Wait a minute! So you told people I was pregnant?! (Flash) Does this look like a conversation that I want to remember?!

Chandler: Whoâs the father?

Monica: Yeah!

Phoebe: I canât say.

Monica: Why?!

Chandler: Why not?

Phoebe: I canât say because heâs famous.

Rachel: Oh my God, who is it?! (Phoebe rolls her eyes.)

Monica: Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.

Phoebe: Okay, okay. Itâs James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.

Chandler: As in Barbara Streisandâs husband James Brolin?

Phoebe: What?! Well he never said that to me!

Opening Credits

[Scene: The Wedding Hall, continued from earlier.]

Photographer: Why donât we have Monica step away and weâll get Chandler and the bridemaids.

Phoebe: How about just the bridemaids?

Chandler: Yâknow I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.

Phoebe: It is.

Rachel: For you. (Chandler leaves.)

Phoebe: Oh my God!

Rachel: Oh, thank you for doing that. I just canât deal with this just quite yet.

Phoebe: So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.

Rachel: You said that she was, I just didnât disagree with you.

Phoebe: Sneaky.

Rachel: Oh yeah.

Photographer: Smile ladies.

Rachel: Oh! (They smile and the picture is taken.) Oh by the way?

Phoebe: Uh-hmm.

Rachel: James Brolin?

Phoebe: Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered heâs gay.

Rachel: Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.

Phoebe: (intrigued) Really?!

[Scene: The Reception Hall, the party is in full swing.]

Bandleader: Thank you very much! Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing!

Monica: Honey, Iâm going to put my hand in your pocket!

Chandler: No?

Monica: No.

Chandler: Iâve been taking dancing lessons.

Monica: What?!

Chandler: Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.

Monica: Oh that is so sweet!

Chandler: So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?

Monica: Yes.

(They walk onto the dance floor and Chandler slips and almost falls.)

Monica: Whatâs the matter?

Chandler: I donât know, itâs these new shoes, theyâre all slippery.

Monica: Well, are you going to be able to do this?

Chandler: Not well.

(They start dancing and Chandler starts slipping around.)

Monica: Well, the good news is, I donât think anyoneâs looking at us.

[Cut to Phoebe and Rachel at their table.]

Phoebe: So, are you ready to talk about it?

Rachel: No.

(Pause)

Phoebe: Now?

Rachel: No!

Phoebe: Okay, weâll talk about something else then.

Rachel: Thank you.

Phoebe: Whoâs the father?!

Rachel: Ugh! Look honey yâknow what? I havenât told him yet, so until I do I donât think I should tell anybody else.

Phoebe: Yeah. Thatâs fine. Thatâs fair. Is it Tag?

Rachel: Phoebe!!

Phoebe: Okay, Iâm sorry. Iâll stop.

Rachel: Okay.

Phoebe: Is it Ross? Itâs Ross isnât itâOh my God, itâs Joey!

Rachel: Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.

Phoebe: Ah-hah! At least we know itâs a him.

[Cut to Joey entering wearing a preppy tennis outfit.]

Monica: (seeing him) Oh sweet Lord.

Joey: Iâm sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and itâs either this or a bathrobe! Look, whatâs more important, the way Iâm dressed or me being with you on your special day?

Monica: Honey, Iâm not even going to pretend I was listening. (Sees someone else.) Hey! Hey! (Goes over to that person.)

[Cut to the hallway outside the room, Ross is going to see which table heâs at and sees a beautiful woman doing the same thing.]

Ross: Hi. Iâm uh, Iâm Ross. I donât, I donât believe weâve met. Iâm Monicaâs older brother.

Woman: Oh hi, Iâm, Iâm Mona from her restaurant.

Ross: Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. (He uses his card to mouth those words.) (Pause) Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.

Mona: You think so? Iâve always kinda hated it.

Ross: Aw come on, Mona Lisa?

Mona: Uh-huh.

Ross: Mona ummâ¦Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no sheâs uhâwell sheâs dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.

Mona: Really?! Well see? I never knew about her.

Ross: Linda Clickclocken. (Pause) So what uh, what-what table are you at? (She shows him.) Oh, uh me too.

Mona: Oh good. Now thereâll be someone there who likes my name.

Ross: (sexily) Yes there will. (Mona leaves and Ross tries to find the same table.) Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert youâve just been bumped up to table one. And if itâs all right with you Iâm gonna take your place at table sixâMartin Clickclocken.

[Cut back inside to Joey giving a beautiful woman a tennis lesson by standing behind her.]

Joey: Thatâs better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it. (They do a practice swing and she really puts her ass into it.)

[Cut to Chandler sitting down near Joey as his mom walks over. His birth mother, not the mother who recently visited one of those clinics in Sweden.]

Mrs. Bing: Chandler darling! Look, my date has finally arrived. Iâd like you to meet Dennis Phillips.

Dennis Phillips: Congratulations.

Chandler: Thank you.

Mrs. Bing: Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.

Chandler: Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.

Dennis Phillips: Oh, Iâm so sorry I missed the ceremony, I was stuck at auditions.

Mrs. Bing: Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.

Joey: I donât believe weâve met, Joey Tribbiani.

Dennis Phillips: Dennis Phillips

Joey: Wow, Iâve admired your work for years. You-youâve done some really amazing stuff.

Dennis Phillips: Oh, thank you. Well if youâll excuse me, Iâm gonna go get myself a drink. Be back in a moment. (Walks away.)

Joey: Wow Dennis Phillips! Thatâs great! How did you guys meet?

Mrs. Bing: Well, itâs a funny story.

Chandler: Funny: ha-ha or funny: (Mimes blowing his brain out.)

Bandleader: Thank you, thank you very much. If everyone will please take your seats, dinner will be served.

(Ross starts looking for table six and finds out that itâs the kidâs table. He sees Mona sitting at another table.)

Ross: Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.

Mona: No, nine. (Shows him the card again.)

Ross: Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way (he turns her hand upside down) which uh, which was misleading. Well Iâmâ¦ (He goes at sits down at his new table and the kids stare at him.) Hello.

[Cut to the hallway, Chandler is putting tape on the bottom of his shoes.]

Joey: Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? âCause if I can get in a Broadway show then I wouldâve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and thatâs just for ugly people.

Chandler: What size shoes do you wear?

Joey: Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.

Chandler: Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?

Joey: Uh, I donât even really know where I left those. Sorry.

Chandler: (looking at Joeyâs feet) Those arenât eleven and a half.

Joey: Okay fine! Iâm a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, Iâll show ya!

[Cut to Monica and Rachel at their table.]

Monica: Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!

Rachel: Oh yâknow what honey? Letâs not talk about that right now?

Monica: This is so huge.

Rachel: Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?

Monica: Of course not nothing is. Between me and youâ¦

Rachel: Yeah.

Monica: â¦in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?

Rachel: Hey! Yâknow, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything theyâre supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!

Monica: How?

Rachel: I donât know! Maybe they have tools.

Monica: Well I-I talked to and uh, sheâs definitely going to have this baby. Yâknow, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.

Rachel: Well, maybe thatâs, maybe thatâs really brave.

Monica: Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard itâs gonna be.

Rachel: Maybe she hasnât really thought it through that well.

Monica: Well, thereâs a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize sheâs not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?

Rachel: (starting to cry) I donât know.

Monica: Are you okay?

Rachel: Uh-hmm. Iâm just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.

Waiter: Champagne?

Rachel: Oh yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass, takes a sip, and realizes what she just did. She then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass without Monica noticing. It doesnât work.) Oh thatâs-thatâs actually how the French drink it.

(Monica gasps.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: continued from earlier, only now Phoebe joins them.]

Phoebe: Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolinâ¦

Monica: Oh really?!

Phoebe: Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin saidâ¦

Monica: (interrupting) Rachelâs really the one whoâs pregnant.

Phoebe: (shocked) What?! (deadpan) Why bother?

Monica: How do you feel?

Rachel: I donât know. I donât know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I donât want to make. (Takes another sip of champagne and spits it back out) Somebody just take this away from me!!

Phoebe: Calm down. Maybe youâre not pregnant.

Rachel: What?!

Phoebe: When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.

Monica: Yes! Maybe itâs a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?

Rachel: How many ways are there to do that?

Phoebe: Iâm-Iâm just saying, donât freak out until youâre a hundred percent sure.

Rachel: All right, Iâll-Iâll take it again when I get home.

Monica: You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.

Rachel: Okay. Thank you.

Monica: Okay.

Phoebe: Iâll run out and get you one.

Rachel: Oh, you guys are so great.

Monica: Oh, wait a minute! Whoâs is the father?!

Phoebe: Oh no, she wonât tell us.

Monica: Oh, come on itâs my wedding! That can be my present.

Rachel: WhâHey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.

Phoebe: See? This is why you register.

[Cut to Ross at the kiddie table. He reaches for something and a fart noise emanates which causes the kids to laugh.]

Ross: It was the chair again! Okay? Iâm not doing it! It whatâlook, I donâtâyâknow whatâeh-ehâ¦ (He walks away and goes over to Mona.) Hi.

Mona: Hi!

Ross: Umm, would you like to dance?

Mona: Sure.

Ross: Yeah?

Mona: Yeah.

Ross: Oh great! (They get up to dance and Ross is interrupted by a little girl.)

Little Girl: Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?

Ross: Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, Iâm about to dance with this lady.

Little Girl: Okay. (She drops her head in disappointment and walks away.)

Mona: Ohhhh!

Ross: Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldnât mind letting you go first.

Mona: Iâd be happy to. (To Ross) You are very sweet.

Ross: Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why donât we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet.

Little Girl: Sure!

Ross: Yeah? Hop on. (They start dancing and Mona sits down.) Is the pretty lady looking?

Little Girl: Uh-huh.

Ross: Keep dancing.

[Cut to Chandler in the hallway practicing dancing and is doing it very well.]

Chandler: And the world will never know.

Joey: Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?

Chandler: Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.

Joey: No-no! No! No! You donât tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks Iâm a soap actor.

Chandler: But youâre not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.

Joey: Hey!

[Joey walks back inside just as Rossâs dance is finishing.]

Little Girl: Thank you.

Ross: No-no, thank you Miranda.

Little Girl: Melinda!

Ross: All right. (Walks over to Mona.)

Mona: How cute was that?

Ross: I am so gonna score.

Second Girl: What?

Ross: I like your bow.

[Behind them, Joey goes up to the bandleader and interrupts the song.]

Joey: (clinks his glass) Iâd like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, (overly angry) "Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. (Does a fake laugh.) And-and there was some sad memories. (Starts to break down and cry.) Iâm sorry. And-and some scared memoriesâWhoa! (He jumps back, startled.) Eh? And then, and then I realized Iâll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. (Starts to walk away, but realizes something.) Oh! To the happy couple!

[Time Lapse, the interrupted song is finishing.]

Bandleader: Thank you.

Ross: (to the second girl) That was very nice Ashley.

Ashley: Can we do it again?

Ross: No-no. (Walks over to Mona again.)

Mona: So, is it my turn now?

(A large little fat girl walks over.)

Fat Girl: Iâm next!

Ross: Oh! (Recoils in horror.)

Mona: Uh, thatâs okay. You can dance with her first.

Ross: Oh, you-you sure? (She nods yes.) Okay. (To the girl) Okay. So whatâs uh, whatâs your name.

Fat Girl: Gert!

Ross: Thatâs, thatâs pretty. (They start to dance and Gert tries to step on Rossâs feet, but he pulls them out of harmâs way.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert?

Gert: Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it.

Ross: Okay. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross winces in pain.)

Gert: Why arenât you moving your feet?

Ross: Iâm trying. (He strains to move his feet.)

Gert: Faster! Youâre not going fast enough!

Ross: Maybe I should stand on your feet! (Gertâs shocked and Ross realizes what he said and tries to brush it off.)

[Cut to Joey going over to talk to Dennis Phillips.]

Joey: So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?

Dennis Phillips: Oh my God, that was for my benefit?

Joey: Well, Iâd like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know youâre casting for this new showâ¦

Dennis Phillips: Look umm Joey, I-I donât think youâre quite right for this project.

Joey: Oh, see thatâs where youâre wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didnât see it up there, just-just try me.

Dennis Phillips: Itâs an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?

Joey: Well Iâm not proud of this, butâ¦ (He turns around and starts to mess with his eyelids.)

Dennis Phillips: Oh my God! No-no-no! Please! Please! Donât-donât-donât!

[Cut to Monica walking up to Chandler.]

Monica: Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?

Chandler: Did it turn into sand?

Monica: Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, youâll be fine. (She starts to walk towards the floor.)

Chandler: (sliding up behind her) No. No, I wonât. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didnât want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.

Monica: Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. (Chandler grunts.) Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesnât matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. (They go onto the floor.) Just try not to move your feet at all. (Chandler starts to get into the groove and bust a move.) There you go.

(Mr. Geller dances over.)

Mr. Geller: Chandler, Iâm gonna have you arrested.

Chandler: Why?

Mr. Geller: You stole my moves. (He starts to dance like Chandler was and Chandler stops.)

Chandler: Whoâs the father?

Monica: Yeah!

Phoebe: I canât say.

Monica: Why?!

Chandler: Why not?

Phoebe: I canât say because heâs famous.

Rachel: Oh my God, who is it?! (Phoebe rolls her eyes.)

Monica: Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us.

Phoebe: Okay, okay. Itâs James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby.

Chandler: As in Barbara Streisandâs husband James Brolin?

Phoebe: What?! Well he never said that to me!

[Scene: The Wedding Hall, continued from earlier.]

Photographer: Why donât we have Monica step away and weâll get Chandler and the bridemaids.

Phoebe: How about just the bridemaids?

Chandler: Yâknow I am the groom right? I was told it was kinda big deal.

Phoebe: It is.

Rachel: For you. (Chandler leaves.)

Phoebe: Oh my God!

Rachel: Oh, thank you for doing that. I just canât deal with this just quite yet.

Phoebe: So instead you told me Monica was pregnant.

Rachel: You said that she was, I just didnât disagree with you.

Phoebe: Sneaky.

Rachel: Oh yeah.

Photographer: Smile ladies.

Rachel: Oh! (They smile and the picture is taken.) Oh by the way?

Phoebe: Uh-hmm.

Rachel: James Brolin?

Phoebe: Oh, I know. I could only think of two names, him and Ed Begley Jr. and then I remembered heâs gay.

Rachel: Ed Begley Jr. is not gay.

Phoebe: (intrigued) Really?!

[Scene: The Reception Hall, the party is in full swing.]

Bandleader: Thank you very much! Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce to you for the very first time, Mr. and Mrs. Chandler Bing!

Monica: Honey, Iâm going to put my hand in your pocket!

Chandler: No?

Monica: No.

Chandler: Iâve been taking dancing lessons.

Monica: What?!

Chandler: Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.

Monica: Oh that is so sweet!

Chandler: So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?

Monica: Yes.

(They walk onto the dance floor and Chandler slips and almost falls.)

Monica: Whatâs the matter?

Chandler: I donât know, itâs these new shoes, theyâre all slippery.

Monica: Well, are you going to be able to do this?

Chandler: Not well.

(They start dancing and Chandler starts slipping around.)

Monica: Well, the good news is, I donât think anyoneâs looking at us.

[Cut to Phoebe and Rachel at their table.]

Phoebe: So, are you ready to talk about it?

Rachel: No.

(Pause)

Phoebe: Now?

Rachel: No!

Phoebe: Okay, weâll talk about something else then.

Rachel: Thank you.

Phoebe: Whoâs the father?!

Rachel: Ugh! Look honey yâknow what? I havenât told him yet, so until I do I donât think I should tell anybody else.

Phoebe: Yeah. Thatâs fine. Thatâs fair. Is it Tag?

Rachel: Phoebe!!

Phoebe: Okay, Iâm sorry. Iâll stop.

Rachel: Okay.

Phoebe: Is it Ross? Itâs Ross isnât itâOh my God, itâs Joey!

Rachel: Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.

Phoebe: Ah-hah! At least we know itâs a him.

[Cut to Joey entering wearing a preppy tennis outfit.]

Monica: (seeing him) Oh sweet Lord.

Joey: Iâm sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and itâs either this or a bathrobe! Look, whatâs more important, the way Iâm dressed or me being with you on your special day?

Monica: Honey, Iâm not even going to pretend I was listening. (Sees someone else.) Hey! Hey! (Goes over to that person.)

[Cut to the hallway outside the room, Ross is going to see which table heâs at and sees a beautiful woman doing the same thing.]

Ross: Hi. Iâm uh, Iâm Ross. I donât, I donât believe weâve met. Iâm Monicaâs older brother.

Woman: Oh hi, Iâm, Iâm Mona from her restaurant.

Ross: Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. (He uses his card to mouth those words.) (Pause) Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.

Mona: You think so? Iâve always kinda hated it.

Ross: Aw come on, Mona Lisa?

Mona: Uh-huh.

Ross: Mona ummâ¦Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no sheâs uhâwell sheâs dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.

Mona: Really?! Well see? I never knew about her.

Ross: Linda Clickclocken. (Pause) So what uh, what-what table are you at? (She shows him.) Oh, uh me too.

Mona: Oh good. Now thereâll be someone there who likes my name.

Ross: (sexily) Yes there will. (Mona leaves and Ross tries to find the same table.) Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert youâve just been bumped up to table one. And if itâs all right with you Iâm gonna take your place at table sixâMartin Clickclocken.

[Cut back inside to Joey giving a beautiful woman a tennis lesson by standing behind her.]

Joey: Thatâs better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it. (They do a practice swing and she really puts her ass into it.)

[Cut to Chandler sitting down near Joey as his mom walks over. His birth mother, not the mother who recently visited one of those clinics in Sweden.]

Mrs. Bing: Chandler darling! Look, my date has finally arrived. Iâd like you to meet Dennis Phillips.

Dennis Phillips: Congratulations.

Chandler: Thank you.

Mrs. Bing: Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.

Chandler: Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.

Dennis Phillips: Oh, Iâm so sorry I missed the ceremony, I was stuck at auditions.

Mrs. Bing: Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.

Joey: I donât believe weâve met, Joey Tribbiani.

Dennis Phillips: Dennis Phillips

Joey: Wow, Iâve admired your work for years. You-youâve done some really amazing stuff.

Dennis Phillips: Oh, thank you. Well if youâll excuse me, Iâm gonna go get myself a drink. Be back in a moment. (Walks away.)

Joey: Wow Dennis Phillips! Thatâs great! How did you guys meet?

Mrs. Bing: Well, itâs a funny story.

Bandleader: Thank you, thank you very much. If everyone will please take your seats, dinner will be served.

(Ross starts looking for table six and finds out that itâs the kidâs table. He sees Mona sitting at another table.)

Ross: Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.

Mona: No, nine. (Shows him the card again.)

Ross: Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way (he turns her hand upside down) which uh, which was misleading. Well Iâmâ¦ (He goes at sits down at his new table and the kids stare at him.) Hello.

[Cut to the hallway, Chandler is putting tape on the bottom of his shoes.]

Joey: Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? âCause if I can get in a Broadway show then I wouldâve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and thatâs just for ugly people.

Chandler: What size shoes do you wear?

Joey: Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.

Chandler: Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?

Joey: Uh, I donât even really know where I left those. Sorry.

Chandler: (looking at Joeyâs feet) Those arenât eleven and a half.

Joey: Okay fine! Iâm a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, Iâll show ya!

[Cut to Monica and Rachel at their table.]

Monica: Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!

Rachel: Oh yâknow what honey? Letâs not talk about that right now?

Monica: This is so huge.

Rachel: Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?

Monica: Of course not nothing is. Between me and youâ¦

Rachel: Yeah.

Monica: â¦in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?

Rachel: Hey! Yâknow, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything theyâre supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!

Monica: How?

Rachel: I donât know! Maybe they have tools.

Monica: Well I-I talked to and uh, sheâs definitely going to have this baby. Yâknow, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.

Rachel: Well, maybe thatâs, maybe thatâs really brave.

Monica: Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard itâs gonna be.

Rachel: Maybe she hasnât really thought it through that well.

Monica: Well, thereâs a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize sheâs not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?

Rachel: (starting to cry) I donât know.

Monica: Are you okay?

Rachel: Uh-hmm. Iâm just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.

Waiter: Champagne?

Rachel: Oh yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass, takes a sip, and realizes what she just did. She then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass without Monica noticing. It doesnât work.) Oh thatâs-thatâs actually how the French drink it.

(Monica gasps.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: continued from earlier, only now Phoebe joins them.]

Phoebe: Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolinâ¦

Monica: Oh really?!

Phoebe: Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin saidâ¦

Monica: (interrupting) Rachelâs really the one whoâs pregnant.

Phoebe: (shocked) What?! (deadpan) Why bother?

Monica: How do you feel?

Rachel: I donât know. I donât know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I donât want to make. (Takes another sip of champagne and spits it back out) Somebody just take this away from me!!

Phoebe: Calm down. Maybe youâre not pregnant.

Rachel: What?!

Phoebe: When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.

Monica: Yes! Maybe itâs a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?

Rachel: How many ways are there to do that?

Phoebe: Iâm-Iâm just saying, donât freak out until youâre a hundred percent sure.

Rachel: All right, Iâll-Iâll take it again when I get home.

Monica: You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.

Rachel: Okay. Thank you.

Monica: Okay.

Phoebe: Iâll run out and get you one.

Rachel: Oh, you guys are so great.

Monica: Oh, wait a minute! Whoâs is the father?!

Phoebe: Oh no, she wonât tell us.

Monica: Oh, come on itâs my wedding! That can be my present.

Rachel: WhâHey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.

Phoebe: See? This is why you register.

[Cut to Ross at the kiddie table. He reaches for something and a fart noise emanates which causes the kids to laugh.]

Ross: It was the chair again! Okay? Iâm not doing it! It whatâlook, I donâtâyâknow whatâeh-ehâ¦ (He walks away and goes over to Mona.) Hi.

Mona: Hi!

Ross: Umm, would you like to dance?

Mona: Sure.

Ross: Yeah?

Mona: Yeah.

Ross: Oh great! (They get up to dance and Ross is interrupted by a little girl.)

Little Girl: Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?

Ross: Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, Iâm about to dance with this lady.

Little Girl: Okay. (She drops her head in disappointment and walks away.)

Mona: Ohhhh!

Ross: Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldnât mind letting you go first.

Mona: Iâd be happy to. (To Ross) You are very sweet.

Ross: Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why donât we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet.

Little Girl: Sure!

Ross: Yeah? Hop on. (They start dancing and Mona sits down.) Is the pretty lady looking?

Little Girl: Uh-huh.

Ross: Keep dancing.

[Cut to Chandler in the hallway practicing dancing and is doing it very well.]

Chandler: And the world will never know.

Joey: Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?

Chandler: Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.

Joey: No-no! No! No! You donât tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks Iâm a soap actor.

Chandler: But youâre not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.

Joey: Hey!

[Joey walks back inside just as Rossâs dance is finishing.]

Little Girl: Thank you.

Ross: No-no, thank you Miranda.

Little Girl: Melinda!

Ross: All right. (Walks over to Mona.)

Ross: I am so gonna score.

Second Girl: What?

Ross: I like your bow.

[Behind them, Joey goes up to the bandleader and interrupts the song.]

Joey: (clinks his glass) Iâd like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, (overly angry) "Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. (Does a fake laugh.) And-and there was some sad memories. (Starts to break down and cry.) Iâm sorry. And-and some scared memoriesâWhoa! (He jumps back, startled.) Eh? And then, and then I realized Iâll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. (Starts to walk away, but realizes something.) Oh! To the happy couple!

[Time Lapse, the interrupted song is finishing.]

Bandleader: Thank you.

Ross: (to the second girl) That was very nice Ashley.

Ashley: Can we do it again?

Ross: No-no. (Walks over to Mona again.)

Mona: So, is it my turn now?

(A large little fat girl walks over.)

Fat Girl: Iâm next!

Ross: Oh! (Recoils in horror.)

Mona: Uh, thatâs okay. You can dance with her first.

Ross: Oh, you-you sure? (She nods yes.) Okay. (To the girl) Okay. So whatâs uh, whatâs your name.

Fat Girl: Gert!

Ross: Thatâs, thatâs pretty. (They start to dance and Gert tries to step on Rossâs feet, but he pulls them out of harmâs way.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert?

Gert: Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it.

Ross: Okay. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross winces in pain.)

Gert: Why arenât you moving your feet?

Ross: Iâm trying. (He strains to move his feet.)

Gert: Faster! Youâre not going fast enough!

Ross: Maybe I should stand on your feet! (Gertâs shocked and Ross realizes what he said and tries to brush it off.)

[Cut to Joey going over to talk to Dennis Phillips.]

Joey: So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?

Dennis Phillips: Oh my God, that was for my benefit?

Joey: Well, Iâd like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know youâre casting for this new showâ¦

Dennis Phillips: Look umm Joey, I-I donât think youâre quite right for this project.

Joey: Oh, see thatâs where youâre wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didnât see it up there, just-just try me.

Dennis Phillips: Itâs an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?

Joey: Well Iâm not proud of this, butâ¦ (He turns around and starts to mess with his eyelids.)

Dennis Phillips: Oh my God! No-no-no! Please! Please! Donât-donât-donât!

[Cut to Monica walking up to Chandler.]

Monica: Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?

Chandler: Did it turn into sand?

Monica: Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, youâll be fine. (She starts to walk towards the floor.)

Chandler: (sliding up behind her) No. No, I wonât. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didnât want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.

Monica: Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. (Chandler grunts.) Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesnât matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. (They go onto the floor.) Just try not to move your feet at all. (Chandler starts to get into the groove and bust a move.) There you go.

(Mr. Geller dances over.)

Mr. Geller: Chandler, Iâm gonna have you arrested.

Chandler: Why?

Mr. Geller: You stole my moves. (He starts to dance like Chandler was and Chandler stops.)

Chandler: Before we go out there Iâve got a present for ya.

Monica: Honey, Iâm going to put my hand in your pocket!

Chandler: No?

Monica: No.

Chandler: Iâve been taking dancing lessons.

Monica: What?!

Chandler: Yeah, the last six weeks. I wanted this to be a moment you will never forget.

Monica: Oh that is so sweet!

Chandler: So? Would you care to join me in our first dance as husband and wife?

Monica: Yes.

(They walk onto the dance floor and Chandler slips and almost falls.)

Monica: Whatâs the matter?

Chandler: I donât know, itâs these new shoes, theyâre all slippery.

Monica: Well, are you going to be able to do this?

Chandler: Not well.

(They start dancing and Chandler starts slipping around.)

Monica: Well, the good news is, I donât think anyoneâs looking at us.

[Cut to Phoebe and Rachel at their table.]

Phoebe: So, are you ready to talk about it?

Rachel: No.

(Pause)

Phoebe: Now?

Rachel: No!

Phoebe: Okay, weâll talk about something else then.

Rachel: Thank you.

Phoebe: Whoâs the father?!

Rachel: Ugh! Look honey yâknow what? I havenât told him yet, so until I do I donât think I should tell anybody else.

Phoebe: Yeah. Thatâs fine. Thatâs fair. Is it Tag?

Rachel: Phoebe!!

Phoebe: Okay, Iâm sorry. Iâll stop.

Rachel: Okay.

Phoebe: Is it Ross? Itâs Ross isnât itâOh my God, itâs Joey!

Rachel: Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.

Phoebe: Ah-hah! At least we know itâs a him.

[Cut to Joey entering wearing a preppy tennis outfit.]

Monica: (seeing him) Oh sweet Lord.

Joey: Iâm sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and itâs either this or a bathrobe! Look, whatâs more important, the way Iâm dressed or me being with you on your special day?

Monica: Honey, Iâm not even going to pretend I was listening. (Sees someone else.) Hey! Hey! (Goes over to that person.)

[Cut to the hallway outside the room, Ross is going to see which table heâs at and sees a beautiful woman doing the same thing.]

Ross: Hi. Iâm uh, Iâm Ross. I donât, I donât believe weâve met. Iâm Monicaâs older brother.

Woman: Oh hi, Iâm, Iâm Mona from her restaurant.

Ross: Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. (He uses his card to mouth those words.) (Pause) Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.

Mona: You think so? Iâve always kinda hated it.

Ross: Aw come on, Mona Lisa?

Mona: Uh-huh.

Ross: Mona ummâ¦Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no sheâs uhâwell sheâs dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.

Mona: Really?! Well see? I never knew about her.

Ross: Linda Clickclocken. (Pause) So what uh, what-what table are you at? (She shows him.) Oh, uh me too.

Mona: Oh good. Now thereâll be someone there who likes my name.

Ross: (sexily) Yes there will. (Mona leaves and Ross tries to find the same table.) Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert youâve just been bumped up to table one. And if itâs all right with you Iâm gonna take your place at table sixâMartin Clickclocken.

[Cut back inside to Joey giving a beautiful woman a tennis lesson by standing behind her.]

Joey: Thatâs better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it. (They do a practice swing and she really puts her ass into it.)

[Cut to Chandler sitting down near Joey as his mom walks over. His birth mother, not the mother who recently visited one of those clinics in Sweden.]

Mrs. Bing: Chandler darling! Look, my date has finally arrived. Iâd like you to meet Dennis Phillips.

Dennis Phillips: Congratulations.

Chandler: Thank you.

Mrs. Bing: Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.

Chandler: Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.

Dennis Phillips: Oh, Iâm so sorry I missed the ceremony, I was stuck at auditions.

Mrs. Bing: Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.

Joey: I donât believe weâve met, Joey Tribbiani.

Dennis Phillips: Dennis Phillips

Joey: Wow, Iâve admired your work for years. You-youâve done some really amazing stuff.

Dennis Phillips: Oh, thank you. Well if youâll excuse me, Iâm gonna go get myself a drink. Be back in a moment. (Walks away.)

Joey: Wow Dennis Phillips! Thatâs great! How did you guys meet?

Mrs. Bing: Well, itâs a funny story.

Chandler: Funny: ha-ha or funny: (Mimes blowing his brain out.)

[Time lapse. The band is finishing another song.]

Bandleader: Thank you, thank you very much. If everyone will please take your seats, dinner will be served.

(Ross starts looking for table six and finds out that itâs the kidâs table. He sees Mona sitting at another table.)

Ross: Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.

Mona: No, nine. (Shows him the card again.)

Ross: Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way (he turns her hand upside down) which uh, which was misleading. Well Iâmâ¦ (He goes at sits down at his new table and the kids stare at him.) Hello.

[Cut to the hallway, Chandler is putting tape on the bottom of his shoes.]

Joey: Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? âCause if I can get in a Broadway show then I wouldâve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and thatâs just for ugly people.

Chandler: What size shoes do you wear?

Joey: Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.

Chandler: Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?

Joey: Uh, I donât even really know where I left those. Sorry.

Chandler: (looking at Joeyâs feet) Those arenât eleven and a half.

Joey: Okay fine! Iâm a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, Iâll show ya!

[Cut to Monica and Rachel at their table.]

Monica: Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!

Rachel: Oh yâknow what honey? Letâs not talk about that right now?

Monica: This is so huge.

Rachel: Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?

Monica: Of course not nothing is. Between me and youâ¦

Rachel: Yeah.

Monica: â¦in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?

Rachel: Hey! Yâknow, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything theyâre supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!

Monica: How?

Rachel: I donât know! Maybe they have tools.

Monica: Well I-I talked to and uh, sheâs definitely going to have this baby. Yâknow, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.

Rachel: Well, maybe thatâs, maybe thatâs really brave.

Monica: Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard itâs gonna be.

Rachel: Maybe she hasnât really thought it through that well.

Monica: Well, thereâs a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize sheâs not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?

Rachel: (starting to cry) I donât know.

Monica: Are you okay?

Rachel: Uh-hmm. Iâm just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.

Waiter: Champagne?

Rachel: Oh yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass, takes a sip, and realizes what she just did. She then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass without Monica noticing. It doesnât work.) Oh thatâs-thatâs actually how the French drink it.

(Monica gasps.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: continued from earlier, only now Phoebe joins them.]

Phoebe: Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolinâ¦

Monica: Oh really?!

Phoebe: Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin saidâ¦

Monica: (interrupting) Rachelâs really the one whoâs pregnant.

Phoebe: (shocked) What?! (deadpan) Why bother?

Monica: How do you feel?

Rachel: I donât know. I donât know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I donât want to make. (Takes another sip of champagne and spits it back out) Somebody just take this away from me!!

Phoebe: Calm down. Maybe youâre not pregnant.

Rachel: What?!

Phoebe: When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.

Monica: Yes! Maybe itâs a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?

Rachel: How many ways are there to do that?

Phoebe: Iâm-Iâm just saying, donât freak out until youâre a hundred percent sure.

Rachel: All right, Iâll-Iâll take it again when I get home.

Monica: You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.

Rachel: Okay. Thank you.

Monica: Okay.

Phoebe: Iâll run out and get you one.

Rachel: Oh, you guys are so great.

Monica: Oh, wait a minute! Whoâs is the father?!

Phoebe: Oh no, she wonât tell us.

Monica: Oh, come on itâs my wedding! That can be my present.

Rachel: WhâHey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.

Phoebe: See? This is why you register.

[Cut to Ross at the kiddie table. He reaches for something and a fart noise emanates which causes the kids to laugh.]

Ross: It was the chair again! Okay? Iâm not doing it! It whatâlook, I donâtâyâknow whatâeh-ehâ¦ (He walks away and goes over to Mona.) Hi.

Mona: Hi!

Ross: Umm, would you like to dance?

Mona: Sure.

Ross: Yeah?

Mona: Yeah.

Ross: Oh great! (They get up to dance and Ross is interrupted by a little girl.)

Little Girl: Dr. Geller?

Ross: I wasnât farting! (To Mona) Uh, a little game from our table. (To the little girl) Yes?

Little Girl: Dr. Geller, will you dance with me?

Ross: Oh umm, well uh, maybe-maybe later. Right now, Iâm about to dance with this lady.

Little Girl: Okay. (She drops her head in disappointment and walks away.)

Mona: Ohhhh!

Ross: Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldnât mind letting you go first.

Mona: Iâd be happy to. (To Ross) You are very sweet.

Ross: Yes I-I am. In fact umm hey, why donât we try it my special way? You can dance on my feet.

Little Girl: Sure!

Ross: Yeah? Hop on. (They start dancing and Mona sits down.) Is the pretty lady looking?

Little Girl: Uh-huh.

Ross: Keep dancing.

[Cut to Chandler in the hallway practicing dancing and is doing it very well.]

Chandler: And the world will never know.

Joey: Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?

Chandler: Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.

Joey: No-no! No! No! You donât tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks Iâm a soap actor.

Chandler: But youâre not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.

Joey: Hey!

[Joey walks back inside just as Rossâs dance is finishing.]

Little Girl: Thank you.

Ross: No-no, thank you Miranda.

Little Girl: Melinda!

Ross: All right. (Walks over to Mona.)

Mona: How cute was that?

Second Girl: Can I go next?

Ross: What? Of course you can! Hop on!

Mona: Okay, but I get to hop on after her. (Ross bites the air in response.)

Ross: I am so gonna score.

Second Girl: What?

Ross: I like your bow.

[Behind them, Joey goes up to the bandleader and interrupts the song.]

Joey: (clinks his glass) Iâd like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, (overly angry) "Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. (Does a fake laugh.) And-and there was some sad memories. (Starts to break down and cry.) Iâm sorry. And-and some scared memoriesâWhoa! (He jumps back, startled.) Eh? And then, and then I realized Iâll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. (Starts to walk away, but realizes something.) Oh! To the happy couple!

[Time Lapse, the interrupted song is finishing.]

Bandleader: Thank you.

Ross: (to the second girl) That was very nice Ashley.

Ashley: Can we do it again?

Ross: No-no. (Walks over to Mona again.)

Mona: So, is it my turn now?

(A large little fat girl walks over.)

Fat Girl: Iâm next!

Ross: Oh! (Recoils in horror.)

Mona: Uh, thatâs okay. You can dance with her first.

Ross: Oh, you-you sure? (She nods yes.) Okay. (To the girl) Okay. So whatâs uh, whatâs your name.

Fat Girl: Gert!

Ross: Thatâs, thatâs pretty. (They start to dance and Gert tries to step on Rossâs feet, but he pulls them out of harmâs way.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert?

Gert: Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it.

Ross: Okay. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross winces in pain.)

Gert: Why arenât you moving your feet?

Ross: Iâm trying. (He strains to move his feet.)

Gert: Faster! Youâre not going fast enough!

Ross: Maybe I should stand on your feet! (Gertâs shocked and Ross realizes what he said and tries to brush it off.)

[Cut to Joey going over to talk to Dennis Phillips.]

Joey: So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?

Dennis Phillips: Oh my God, that was for my benefit?

Joey: Well, Iâd like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know youâre casting for this new showâ¦

Dennis Phillips: Look umm Joey, I-I donât think youâre quite right for this project.

Joey: Oh, see thatâs where youâre wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didnât see it up there, just-just try me.

Dennis Phillips: Itâs an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?

Joey: Well Iâm not proud of this, butâ¦ (He turns around and starts to mess with his eyelids.)

Dennis Phillips: Oh my God! No-no-no! Please! Please! Donât-donât-donât!

[Cut to Monica walking up to Chandler.]

Monica: Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?

Chandler: Did it turn into sand?

Monica: Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, youâll be fine. (She starts to walk towards the floor.)

Chandler: (sliding up behind her) No. No, I wonât. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didnât want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.

Monica: Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. (Chandler grunts.) Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesnât matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. (They go onto the floor.) Just try not to move your feet at all. (Chandler starts to get into the groove and bust a move.) There you go.

(Mr. Geller dances over.)

Mr. Geller: Chandler, Iâm gonna have you arrested.

Chandler: Why?

Mr. Geller: You stole my moves. (He starts to dance like Chandler was and Chandler stops.)

Phoebe: Umm, itâs negative.

Rachel: What?

Phoebe: Itâs negative.

Rachel: Oh. Oh. Well there you go. Whew! (Pause) That isâthatâs greatâthat is really great-great news. (Pause) Yâknow âcause the whole not being ready and kinda the financial aspects, all that. Whew. Wow, this is so just the way it was supposed to be. (Starts to cry.) God.

Monica: Wellâ¦ Well, great.

Phoebe: Here. (Gives Rachel a tissue.)

Rachel: Honey, stop it! I am not going to tell you until I tell him.

Phoebe: Ah-hah! At least we know itâs a him.

[Cut to Joey entering wearing a preppy tennis outfit.]

Monica: (seeing him) Oh sweet Lord.

Joey: Iâm sorry! Okay? I went down to the gift shop and itâs either this or a bathrobe! Look, whatâs more important, the way Iâm dressed or me being with you on your special day?

Monica: Honey, Iâm not even going to pretend I was listening. (Sees someone else.) Hey! Hey! (Goes over to that person.)

[Cut to the hallway outside the room, Ross is going to see which table heâs at and sees a beautiful woman doing the same thing.]

Ross: Hi. Iâm uh, Iâm Ross. I donât, I donât believe weâve met. Iâm Monicaâs older brother.

Woman: Oh hi, Iâm, Iâm Mona from her restaurant.

Ross: Oh! Hello uh, Mona from her restaurant. (He uses his card to mouth those words.) (Pause) Mona, wow what a, what a beautiful name.

Mona: You think so? Iâve always kinda hated it.

Ross: Aw come on, Mona Lisa?

Mona: Uh-huh.

Ross: Mona ummâ¦Clickclocken. The famous botanist? Huh? Oh no sheâs uhâwell sheâs dead now. No, supposedly she was once quite the hottie of the plant world.

Mona: Really?! Well see? I never knew about her.

Ross: Linda Clickclocken. (Pause) So what uh, what-what table are you at? (She shows him.) Oh, uh me too.

Mona: Oh good. Now thereâll be someone there who likes my name.

Ross: (sexily) Yes there will. (Mona leaves and Ross tries to find the same table.) Oh guess what, Molly Gilbert youâve just been bumped up to table one. And if itâs all right with you Iâm gonna take your place at table sixâMartin Clickclocken.

[Cut back inside to Joey giving a beautiful woman a tennis lesson by standing behind her.]

Joey: Thatâs better, now just bend your arms a little more. There you go. Okay, look straight ahead. Now this time I want you to really put your ass into it. (They do a practice swing and she really puts her ass into it.)

[Cut to Chandler sitting down near Joey as his mom walks over. His birth mother, not the mother who recently visited one of those clinics in Sweden.]

Mrs. Bing: Chandler darling! Look, my date has finally arrived. Iâd like you to meet Dennis Phillips.

Dennis Phillips: Congratulations.

Chandler: Thank you.

Mrs. Bing: Dennis is a dear old friend and a fantastic lover.

Chandler: Bravo Dennis thanks for pleasing my mother so.

Dennis Phillips: Oh, Iâm so sorry I missed the ceremony, I was stuck at auditions.

Mrs. Bing: Oh yes, Dennis is directing a new Broadway show.

Joey: I donât believe weâve met, Joey Tribbiani.

Dennis Phillips: Dennis Phillips

Joey: Wow, Iâve admired your work for years. You-youâve done some really amazing stuff.

Dennis Phillips: Oh, thank you. Well if youâll excuse me, Iâm gonna go get myself a drink. Be back in a moment. (Walks away.)

Ross: Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.

Mona: No, nine. (Shows him the card again.)

Ross: Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way (he turns her hand upside down) which uh, which was misleading. Well Iâmâ¦ (He goes at sits down at his new table and the kids stare at him.) Hello.

[Cut to the hallway, Chandler is putting tape on the bottom of his shoes.]

Joey: Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? âCause if I can get in a Broadway show then I wouldâve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and thatâs just for ugly people.

Chandler: What size shoes do you wear?

Joey: Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.

Chandler: Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?

Joey: Uh, I donât even really know where I left those. Sorry.

Chandler: (looking at Joeyâs feet) Those arenât eleven and a half.

Joey: Okay fine! Iâm a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, Iâll show ya!

[Cut to Monica and Rachel at their table.]

Monica: Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!

Rachel: Oh yâknow what honey? Letâs not talk about that right now?

Monica: This is so huge.

Rachel: Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?

Monica: Of course not nothing is. Between me and youâ¦

Rachel: Yeah.

Monica: â¦in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?

Rachel: Hey! Yâknow, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything theyâre supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!

Monica: How?

Rachel: I donât know! Maybe they have tools.

Monica: Well I-I talked to and uh, sheâs definitely going to have this baby. Yâknow, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.

Rachel: Well, maybe thatâs, maybe thatâs really brave.

Monica: Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard itâs gonna be.

Rachel: Maybe she hasnât really thought it through that well.

Monica: Well, thereâs a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize sheâs not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?

Rachel: (starting to cry) I donât know.

Monica: Are you okay?

Rachel: Uh-hmm. Iâm just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.

Waiter: Champagne?

Rachel: Oh yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass, takes a sip, and realizes what she just did. She then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass without Monica noticing. It doesnât work.) Oh thatâs-thatâs actually how the French drink it.

(Monica gasps.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: continued from earlier, only now Phoebe joins them.]

Phoebe: Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolinâ¦

Monica: Oh really?!

Phoebe: Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin saidâ¦

Monica: (interrupting) Rachelâs really the one whoâs pregnant.

Phoebe: (shocked) What?! (deadpan) Why bother?

Monica: How do you feel?

Rachel: I donât know. I donât know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I donât want to make. (Takes another sip of champagne and spits it back out) Somebody just take this away from me!!

Phoebe: Calm down. Maybe youâre not pregnant.

Rachel: What?!

Phoebe: When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.

Monica: Yes! Maybe itâs a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?

Rachel: How many ways are there to do that?

Phoebe: Iâm-Iâm just saying, donât freak out until youâre a hundred percent sure.

Rachel: All right, Iâll-Iâll take it again when I get home.

Monica: You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.

Rachel: Okay. Thank you.

Monica: Okay.

Phoebe: Iâll run out and get you one.

Rachel: Oh, you guys are so great.

Monica: Oh, wait a minute! Whoâs is the father?!

Phoebe: Oh no, she wonât tell us.

Monica: Oh, come on itâs my wedding! That can be my present.

Rachel: WhâHey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.

Phoebe: See? This is why you register.

Ross: It was the chair again! Okay? Iâm not doing it! It whatâlook, I donâtâyâknow whatâeh-ehâ¦ (He walks away and goes over to Mona.) Hi.

Mona: Ohhhh!

Ross: Uh, unless! Unless, uh this lady wouldnât mind letting you go first.

Mona: Iâd be happy to. (To Ross) You are very sweet.

Ross: Keep dancing.

[Cut to Chandler in the hallway practicing dancing and is doing it very well.]

Chandler: And the world will never know.

Joey: Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?

Chandler: Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.

Joey: No-no! No! No! You donât tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks Iâm a soap actor.

Chandler: But youâre not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.

Joey: Hey!

[Joey walks back inside just as Rossâs dance is finishing.]

Little Girl: Thank you.

Ross: No-no, thank you Miranda.

[Behind them, Joey goes up to the bandleader and interrupts the song.]

Joey: (clinks his glass) Iâd like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, (overly angry) "Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. (Does a fake laugh.) And-and there was some sad memories. (Starts to break down and cry.) Iâm sorry. And-and some scared memoriesâWhoa! (He jumps back, startled.) Eh? And then, and then I realized Iâll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. (Starts to walk away, but realizes something.) Oh! To the happy couple!

[Time Lapse, the interrupted song is finishing.]

Bandleader: Thank you.

Ross: (to the second girl) That was very nice Ashley.

Ashley: Can we do it again?

Ross: No-no. (Walks over to Mona again.)

Mona: So, is it my turn now?

(A large little fat girl walks over.)

Fat Girl: Iâm next!

Ross: Oh! (Recoils in horror.)

Mona: Uh, thatâs okay. You can dance with her first.

Ross: Oh, you-you sure? (She nods yes.) Okay. (To the girl) Okay. So whatâs uh, whatâs your name.

Fat Girl: Gert!

Ross: Thatâs, thatâs pretty. (They start to dance and Gert tries to step on Rossâs feet, but he pulls them out of harmâs way.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert?

Gert: Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it.

Ross: Okay. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross winces in pain.)

Gert: Why arenât you moving your feet?

Ross: Iâm trying. (He strains to move his feet.)

Gert: Faster! Youâre not going fast enough!

Ross: Maybe I should stand on your feet! (Gertâs shocked and Ross realizes what he said and tries to brush it off.)

[Cut to Joey going over to talk to Dennis Phillips.]

Joey: So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?

Dennis Phillips: Oh my God, that was for my benefit?

Joey: Well, Iâd like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know youâre casting for this new showâ¦

Dennis Phillips: Look umm Joey, I-I donât think youâre quite right for this project.

Joey: Oh, see thatâs where youâre wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didnât see it up there, just-just try me.

Dennis Phillips: Itâs an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?

Joey: Well Iâm not proud of this, butâ¦ (He turns around and starts to mess with his eyelids.)

Monica: Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?

Chandler: Did it turn into sand?

Monica: Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, youâll be fine. (She starts to walk towards the floor.)

Chandler: (sliding up behind her) No. No, I wonât. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didnât want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.

Monica: Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. (Chandler grunts.) Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesnât matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. (They go onto the floor.) Just try not to move your feet at all. (Chandler starts to get into the groove and bust a move.) There you go.

(Mr. Geller dances over.)

Mr. Geller: Chandler, Iâm gonna have you arrested.

Chandler: Why?

Mr. Geller: You stole my moves. (He starts to dance like Chandler was and Chandler stops.)

[Cut back inside to Joey giving a beautiful woman a tennis lesson by standing behind her.]

Dennis Phillips: Dennis Phillips

Joey: Wow, Iâve admired your work for years. You-youâve done some really amazing stuff.

Ross: Hey! Uh, I thought, I thought you were at table six.

Mona: No, nine. (Shows him the card again.)

Ross: Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way (he turns her hand upside down) which uh, which was misleading. Well Iâmâ¦ (He goes at sits down at his new table and the kids stare at him.) Hello.

[Cut to the hallway, Chandler is putting tape on the bottom of his shoes.]

Joey: Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? âCause if I can get in a Broadway show then I wouldâve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and thatâs just for ugly people.

Chandler: What size shoes do you wear?

Joey: Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.

Chandler: Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?

Joey: Uh, I donât even really know where I left those. Sorry.

Chandler: (looking at Joeyâs feet) Those arenât eleven and a half.

Joey: Okay fine! Iâm a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, Iâll show ya!

[Cut to Monica and Rachel at their table.]

Monica: Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!

Rachel: Oh yâknow what honey? Letâs not talk about that right now?

Monica: This is so huge.

Rachel: Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?

Monica: Of course not nothing is. Between me and youâ¦

Rachel: Yeah.

Monica: â¦in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?

Rachel: Hey! Yâknow, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything theyâre supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!

Monica: How?

Rachel: I donât know! Maybe they have tools.

Monica: Well I-I talked to and uh, sheâs definitely going to have this baby. Yâknow, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.

Rachel: Well, maybe thatâs, maybe thatâs really brave.

Monica: Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard itâs gonna be.

Rachel: Maybe she hasnât really thought it through that well.

Monica: Well, thereâs a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize sheâs not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?

Rachel: (starting to cry) I donât know.

Monica: Are you okay?

Rachel: Uh-hmm. Iâm just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.

Waiter: Champagne?

Rachel: Oh yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass, takes a sip, and realizes what she just did. She then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass without Monica noticing. It doesnât work.) Oh thatâs-thatâs actually how the French drink it.

(Monica gasps.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: continued from earlier, only now Phoebe joins them.]

Phoebe: Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolinâ¦

Monica: Oh really?!

Phoebe: Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin saidâ¦

Monica: (interrupting) Rachelâs really the one whoâs pregnant.

Phoebe: (shocked) What?! (deadpan) Why bother?

Monica: How do you feel?

Rachel: I donât know. I donât know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I donât want to make. (Takes another sip of champagne and spits it back out) Somebody just take this away from me!!

Phoebe: Calm down. Maybe youâre not pregnant.

Rachel: What?!

Phoebe: When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.

Monica: Yes! Maybe itâs a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?

Rachel: How many ways are there to do that?

Phoebe: Iâm-Iâm just saying, donât freak out until youâre a hundred percent sure.

Rachel: All right, Iâll-Iâll take it again when I get home.

Monica: You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.

Rachel: Okay. Thank you.

Monica: Okay.

Phoebe: Iâll run out and get you one.

Rachel: Oh, you guys are so great.

Monica: Oh, wait a minute! Whoâs is the father?!

Phoebe: Oh no, she wonât tell us.

Monica: Oh, come on itâs my wedding! That can be my present.

Rachel: WhâHey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.

Phoebe: See? This is why you register.

Chandler: And the world will never know.

Joey: Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?

Chandler: Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.

Joey: No-no! No! No! You donât tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks Iâm a soap actor.

Chandler: But youâre not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.

Joey: Hey!

[Joey walks back inside just as Rossâs dance is finishing.]

Little Girl: Thank you.

Ross: No-no, thank you Miranda.

Little Girl: Melinda!

[Behind them, Joey goes up to the bandleader and interrupts the song.]

Joey: (clinks his glass) Iâd like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, (overly angry) "Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. (Does a fake laugh.) And-and there was some sad memories. (Starts to break down and cry.) Iâm sorry. And-and some scared memoriesâWhoa! (He jumps back, startled.) Eh? And then, and then I realized Iâll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. (Starts to walk away, but realizes something.) Oh! To the happy couple!

[Time Lapse, the interrupted song is finishing.]

Bandleader: Thank you.

Ross: (to the second girl) That was very nice Ashley.

Ashley: Can we do it again?

Ross: No-no. (Walks over to Mona again.)

Mona: So, is it my turn now?

(A large little fat girl walks over.)

Fat Girl: Iâm next!

Ross: Oh! (Recoils in horror.)

Mona: Uh, thatâs okay. You can dance with her first.

Ross: Oh, you-you sure? (She nods yes.) Okay. (To the girl) Okay. So whatâs uh, whatâs your name.

Fat Girl: Gert!

Ross: Thatâs, thatâs pretty. (They start to dance and Gert tries to step on Rossâs feet, but he pulls them out of harmâs way.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert?

Gert: Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it.

Ross: Okay. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross winces in pain.)

Gert: Why arenât you moving your feet?

Ross: Iâm trying. (He strains to move his feet.)

Gert: Faster! Youâre not going fast enough!

Ross: Maybe I should stand on your feet! (Gertâs shocked and Ross realizes what he said and tries to brush it off.)

[Cut to Joey going over to talk to Dennis Phillips.]

Joey: So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?

Dennis Phillips: Oh my God, that was for my benefit?

Joey: Well, Iâd like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know youâre casting for this new showâ¦

Dennis Phillips: Look umm Joey, I-I donât think youâre quite right for this project.

Joey: Oh, see thatâs where youâre wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didnât see it up there, just-just try me.

Dennis Phillips: Itâs an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?

Joey: Well Iâm not proud of this, butâ¦ (He turns around and starts to mess with his eyelids.)

Monica: Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, youâll be fine. (She starts to walk towards the floor.)

Chandler: (sliding up behind her) No. No, I wonât. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didnât want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.

Monica: Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. (Chandler grunts.) Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesnât matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. (They go onto the floor.) Just try not to move your feet at all. (Chandler starts to get into the groove and bust a move.) There you go.

(Mr. Geller dances over.)

Mr. Geller: Chandler, Iâm gonna have you arrested.

Chandler: Why?

Mr. Geller: You stole my moves. (He starts to dance like Chandler was and Chandler stops.)

Ross: Oh see, before you uh, when you showed it to me you-you held it that way (he turns her hand upside down) which uh, which was misleading. Well Iâmâ¦ (He goes at sits down at his new table and the kids stare at him.) Hello.

[Cut to the hallway, Chandler is putting tape on the bottom of his shoes.]

Joey: Chandler. Will you see if your mom can give my resume to Dennis Phillips? âCause if I can get in a Broadway show then I wouldâve done it all, film, television, and theater. The only think left would be radio, and thatâs just for ugly people.

Chandler: What size shoes do you wear?

Joey: Uh, eleven, eleven and a half.

Chandler: Great, because my shoes are giving me a little problem on the dance floor, can I borrow the boots from your costume?

Joey: Uh, I donât even really know where I left those. Sorry.

Chandler: (looking at Joeyâs feet) Those arenât eleven and a half.

Joey: Okay fine! Iâm a seven! All right, I have surprisingly small feet. But the rest of me is good, Iâll show ya!

[Cut to Monica and Rachel at their table.]

Monica: Can you believe Phoebe got pregnant?!

Rachel: Oh yâknow what honey? Letâs not talk about that right now?

Monica: This is so huge.

Rachel: Sure, but come on, as big as your wedding?

Monica: Of course not nothing is. Between me and youâ¦

Rachel: Yeah.

Monica: â¦in this day and age how dumb do you have to be to get pregnant?

Rachel: Hey! Yâknow, sometimes you can do everything right, everyone can wear everything theyâre supposed to wear, and one of those little guys just gets through!

Monica: How?

Rachel: I donât know! Maybe they have tools.

Monica: Well I-I talked to and uh, sheâs definitely going to have this baby. Yâknow, she said she was gonna raise it on her own.

Rachel: Well, maybe thatâs, maybe thatâs really brave.

Monica: Maybe. I just hope she realizes how hard itâs gonna be.

Rachel: Maybe she hasnât really thought it through that well.

Monica: Well, thereâs a lot to think about. I mean, how is she, how is she going to handle this financially? How is she going to juggle work? Does she realize sheâs not going to have a date again for the next eighteen years?

Rachel: (starting to cry) I donât know.

Monica: Are you okay?

Rachel: Uh-hmm. Iâm just thinking about Phoebe; poor knocked up Phoebe.

Waiter: Champagne?

Rachel: Oh yes! Thank you very much! (She grabs a glass, takes a sip, and realizes what she just did. She then tries to spit the champagne back into the glass without Monica noticing. It doesnât work.) Oh thatâs-thatâs actually how the French drink it.

(Monica gasps.)

Commercial Break

[Scene: continued from earlier, only now Phoebe joins them.]

Phoebe: Well, I just got off the phone with my lover, James Brolinâ¦

Monica: Oh really?!

Phoebe: Yes, and apparently he is married to some singer, but he said he would leave her for me. And I said, "James, James Brolin, are you sure?" James Brolin saidâ¦

Monica: (interrupting) Rachelâs really the one whoâs pregnant.

Phoebe: (shocked) What?! (deadpan) Why bother?

Monica: How do you feel?

Rachel: I donât know. I donât know how I feel. This is all happening so fast. I have to make all these decisions that I donât want to make. (Takes another sip of champagne and spits it back out) Somebody just take this away from me!!

Phoebe: Calm down. Maybe youâre not pregnant.

Rachel: What?!

Phoebe: When I got pregnant with the triplets, I took that test like three times just to make sure.

Monica: Yes! Maybe itâs a false positive. Are you sure you peed on the stick right?

Rachel: How many ways are there to do that?

Phoebe: Iâm-Iâm just saying, donât freak out until youâre a hundred percent sure.

Rachel: All right, Iâll-Iâll take it again when I get home.

Monica: You-you gotta take it now. Come on, do it as a present to me.

Rachel: Okay. Thank you.

Monica: Okay.

Phoebe: Iâll run out and get you one.

Rachel: Oh, you guys are so great.

Monica: Oh, wait a minute! Whoâs is the father?!

Phoebe: Oh no, she wonât tell us.

Monica: Oh, come on itâs my wedding! That can be my present.

Rachel: WhâHey, I just gave you peeing on a stick.

Phoebe: See? This is why you register.

Ross: Keep dancing.

Chandler: And the world will never know.

Joey: Hey! Did you talk to Dennis about me yet?

Chandler: Yes, I told him how talented you were. I told him all about Days Of Our Lives.

Joey: No-no! No! No! You donât tell a Broadway guy that! Now he just thinks Iâm a soap actor.

Chandler: But youâre not just a soap actor. You are a soap actor with freakishly tiny feet.

Joey: Hey!

[Joey walks back inside just as Rossâs dance is finishing.]

Little Girl: Thank you.

Ross: No-no, thank you Miranda.

[Behind them, Joey goes up to the bandleader and interrupts the song.]

Joey: (clinks his glass) Iâd like to propose a toast. To Monica and Chandler, the greatest couple in the world. And my best friends. Now, my when I first found out they were getting married I was, I was a little angry. I was like, (overly angry) "Why God? Why? How can you take them away from me?!" But then I thought back over all our memories together, some happy memories. (Does a fake laugh.) And-and there was some sad memories. (Starts to break down and cry.) Iâm sorry. And-and some scared memoriesâWhoa! (He jumps back, startled.) Eh? And then, and then I realized Iâll always be their friend, their friend who can speak in many dialects and has training in stage combat and is willing to do partial nudity. (Starts to walk away, but realizes something.) Oh! To the happy couple!

[Time Lapse, the interrupted song is finishing.]

Bandleader: Thank you.

Ross: (to the second girl) That was very nice Ashley.

Ashley: Can we do it again?

Ross: No-no. (Walks over to Mona again.)

Mona: So, is it my turn now?

(A large little fat girl walks over.)

Fat Girl: Iâm next!

Ross: Oh! (Recoils in horror.)

Mona: Uh, thatâs okay. You can dance with her first.

Ross: Oh, you-you sure? (She nods yes.) Okay. (To the girl) Okay. So whatâs uh, whatâs your name.

Fat Girl: Gert!

Ross: Thatâs, thatâs pretty. (They start to dance and Gert tries to step on Rossâs feet, but he pulls them out of harmâs way.) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing there Gert?

Gert: Dancing on your feet! Like the other girls did it.

Ross: Okay. (Swallows hard.) Hop on Gert. (She does and Ross winces in pain.)

Gert: Why arenât you moving your feet?

Ross: Iâm trying. (He strains to move his feet.)

Gert: Faster! Youâre not going fast enough!

Ross: Maybe I should stand on your feet! (Gertâs shocked and Ross realizes what he said and tries to brush it off.)

[Cut to Joey going over to talk to Dennis Phillips.]

Joey: So did you uh, happen to catch my toast up there?

Dennis Phillips: Oh my God, that was for my benefit?

Joey: Well, Iâd like to think there was something for everyone. Look, I know youâre casting for this new showâ¦

Dennis Phillips: Look umm Joey, I-I donât think youâre quite right for this project.

Joey: Oh, see thatâs where youâre wrong. Whatever it is I can do it. And if didnât see it up there, just-just try me.

Dennis Phillips: Itâs an all Chinese cast. Can you be Chinese?

Joey: Well Iâm not proud of this, butâ¦ (He turns around and starts to mess with his eyelids.)

Dennis Phillips: Oh my God! No-no-no! Please! Please! Donât-donât-donât!

[Cut to Monica walking up to Chandler.]

Monica: Hey, are you ready to get back on the dance floor?

Chandler: Did it turn into sand?

Monica: Ohh come on, I love this song! Come on, youâll be fine. (She starts to walk towards the floor.)

Chandler: (sliding up behind her) No. No, I wonât. Do you know why I took all those lessons? See, for the first time I didnât want you to be embarrassed to be seen on the dance floor with some clumsy idiot.

Monica: Oh sweetie, you can never embarrass me. (Chandler grunts.) Okay, you can easily embarrass me. But come on, it doesnât matter. All right? I married you! So I want to dance on my wedding night with my husband. Come on. (They go onto the floor.) Just try not to move your feet at all. (Chandler starts to get into the groove and bust a move.) There you go.

(Mr. Geller dances over.)

Mr. Geller: Chandler, Iâm gonna have you arrested.

Chandler: Why?

Mr. Geller: You stole my moves. (He starts to dance like Chandler was and Chandler stops.)

Monica: Whew. Although yâknow, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I meanâ¦ I guess yâknow it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?

Phoebe: Well I guess itâs okay to open one more if itâs part of a set. Yâknow, itâs probably this one. (Grabs another small one.)

Rachel: Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.

Phoebe: Pretty big? Itâs huge! God, this guy doesnât have a clue! Heâs just walking down the street thinking, âI had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!â then bam! Heâs a father and everythingâs different.

Rachel: Well itâs only different if he wants it to be. I mean, Iâm not gonna ask him for anything.

Chandler: Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?

Ross: No-no-no, Iâm saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody elseâs faces.

Chandler: Are you serious?

Rachel: No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!

Phoebe: Well-well but it is huge.

Rachel: I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didnât even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.

Phoebe: Youâre thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. Itâs like, itâs like ripping off this Band-Aid. (On her arm) Quick and painless, watch. (Rips it off.) Oh mother ofâ¦See?

Chandler: Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!

[Scene: Outside Central Perk, Rachel and Phoebe are about to go inside.]

Phoebe: Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!

Rachel: What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?

Phoebe: I may play the fool at times, but Iâm a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wonât quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.

Rachel: Oh Godâ¦ Oh, heâs in there right now?

Phoebe: Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?

Rachel: Uh, letâs rip!

(He goes up on stage, mimes like he's giving the speech, and Chandler takes his picture. However, before he gets down everyone starts clinking their glasses for a real speech.)

Phoebe: Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orâ¦poison? No? Just for me? Okay. (Walks away.)

Tag: Whatâs going on Rach?

Rachel: Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But yâknow you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?

Tag: Yâknow, Iâm actually glad Phoebe called. (He pulls out a stool and Rachel sits down.) I know we broke up because you thought I wasnât mature enough, but Iâve really grown up and think we should get back together.

Rachel: Oh, itâs just not the right time.

Tag: It is the right time. (Takes her hand.)

Rachel: Okay.

Joey: Oh hey! You got my parentâs gift! (Holds it up.)

Monica: Yeah. What is that?

(Phoebe and Rachel enter.)

Monica: Hey! Howâd it go?

Joey: Yeah. What-what did Tag say?

Rachel: Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?

Joey: I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you. (They hug.)

Rachel: Oh wow, you didnât even try to unhook my bra!

Monica: So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?

Rachel: No, I will. Iâm just not up for it tonight.

Joey: Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know youâre not gonna be alone in this.

Rachel: Iâm not?

Joey: Listen I uhâ¦ (He takes her hand.) Itâs a scary world out there especially if youâre a single mom. Yâknow, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Yâknow? So, (gets down on one knee again) Rachel Green will you marry me?

Rachel: What?

Monica: What?!

Phoebe: What?!!

Joey: Pheebs, give me the ring back!

Phoebe: No!!

Rachel: No! Joey, oh youâre so sweet. Youâre so-so sweet, honey. But Iâm not, Iâm not looking for a husband.

Joey: (heartbroken) I understand.

Rachel: Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down. (Exits.)

Chandler: Itâs picture time.

Ross: Now you are going to love these.

Chandler: (showing her the pictures) Hereâs a picture of Ross. (Shows another one.) And thatâs me. (Another one.) And thatâs me and Ross. (Another one.) Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.

Monica: Wow! That is a great picture!

Chandler: Eh?

Monica: Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags! (Throws them into his chest.)

Ross: Huh, didnât see that coming.

Chandler: Okay, so this isnât a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss withâ¦with this lady. Which by the look on your face Iâm sure youâll remember. So we donât needâ(Rips the picture)âThereâs no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.

Monica: That would be a good idea.

Chandler: Okay. (Sees the living room.) You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!

Monica: You kissed another woman!

Chandler: Call it even?!

Monica: Okay! (They high-five and he walks out.)

Ross: Well, Iâm gonna go get these (the floral bouquet he walked in with) in some water.

Phoebe: Wait you stole those from these peopleâs wedding?

Ross: No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. (Starts to leave.) Hey! My sweater! Iâve been looking for this for like a month!

(He exits leaving a stunned Phoebe and Monica.)

Chandler: Oh.

Monica: Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.

Rachel: Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until yâknow, he screamed out Radisson at the end.

Ross: Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" (Chandler laughs.) Yeah, then you did that.

Chandler: So you donât have the cameras?!

Ross: No. Sorry man.

Chandler: So? What? What? Theyâre gone! Monicaâs gonna freak!

Monica: No! (Pause) But, theyâre callinâ out to me! I mean this little guy (Holds up a small one) even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldnât mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?

Phoebe: A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.

(Monica opens it anyways.)

Monica: A tiny salt shaker!!!

Phoebe: Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!

Monica: Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.

Phoebe: Oh yeah.

Monica: Good. Okay, Iâm just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.

Phoebe: Okay.

Monica: Whew. Although yâknow, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I meanâ¦ I guess yâknow it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?

Phoebe: Well I guess itâs okay to open one more if itâs part of a set. Yâknow, itâs probably this one. (Grabs another small one.)

Monica: Or this one! (She grabs and starts to open the biggest present.)

Monica: No! Joey and Ross donât know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebeâs pregnant.

Phoebe: Yeah thatâs right Chandler does still think Iâm pregnant. He hasnât asked me how Iâm feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course.

Rachel: Donât worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, âcause Iâm going to tell the father today.

Phoebe: Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?

Rachel: Ew! No!

Phoebe: What?! I think heâs cute.

Rachel: Well then you have his baby.

Phoebe: Believe me Iâm trying.

Monica: Wow. Yâknow it is so weird. I mean, youâre gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea whatâs gonna happen.

Phoebe: Yeah. Youâre just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. Youâre like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.

Rachel: Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.

Phoebe: Pretty big? Itâs huge! God, this guy doesnât have a clue! Heâs just walking down the street thinking, âI had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!â then bam! Heâs a father and everythingâs different.

Rachel: Well itâs only different if he wants it to be. I mean, Iâm not gonna ask him for anything.

Phoebe: Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now heâs walking around thinking, âDo I want to be a dad?â and then bam!

Monica: What was that bam?

Phoebe: I donât. He gotâ¦he-he-he-heâs hit by a bus.

Joey: (entering) Hey!

Rachel: Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?

Joey: (warily) Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! (Starts to leave) I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!

Rachel: Oh Joey! Joey! No, itâs not you! You didnât get anybody pregnant!

Joey: Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? (Pause.) Is somebody pregnant?

Phoebe: Oh yeah. Thatâs me.

Joey: Oh my God Pheebs! Youâre gonna have a baby?

Phoebe: Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, Iâm gonna have a baby! (Joey and Phoebe hug.)

Joey: Whoa, wait a minute. Whoâs the father?

Phoebe: You donât know him. Itâs not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby. (She sits down like sheâs pregnant.)

Ross: Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-oneâs turned them.

Chandler: Well this is great. Yâknow, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, sheâs really depressed.

Ross: Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?

Chandler: All my energy is going into not asking that question. I canât believe I screwed this up!

Ross: Iâm sorry man. (Formally dressed people start to enter.) Hereâs a thought. This is the same ballroom. Thereâs a band. Thereâs gonna be plenty of dressed up people.

Chandler: Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?

Ross: No-no-no, Iâm saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody elseâs faces.

Chandler: Are you serious?

Ross: Iâm just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?

Chandler: Marriage advice? Really?!

Ross: Iâm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Arenât these the same flowers?

Chandler: I donât know, Monica picked out the flowers.

Rachel: No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!

Phoebe: Well-well but it is huge.

Rachel: I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didnât even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.

Phoebe: Youâre thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. Itâs like, itâs like ripping off this Band-Aid. (On her arm) Quick and painless, watch. (Rips it off.) Oh mother ofâ¦See?

Man At The Wedding: Uh, your finger was covering the lens.

Chandler: Who are you? Ansel Adams?! Get outta here!

[Scene: Outside Central Perk, Rachel and Phoebe are about to go inside.]

Phoebe: Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!

Rachel: What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?

Phoebe: I may play the fool at times, but Iâm a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wonât quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.

Rachel: Oh Godâ¦ Oh, heâs in there right now?

Phoebe: Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?

Rachel: Uh, letâs rip!

Phoebe: Really? Are you sure?

Rachel: Oh Phoebe!

(He goes up on stage, mimes like he's giving the speech, and Chandler takes his picture. However, before he gets down everyone starts clinking their glasses for a real speech.)

Ross: Will the owner of a 1995 Buick LeSabre please see the front desk? Your car is about to be towed.

Tag: No. (Unzips his coat.) This is my red sweater.

Phoebe: Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orâ¦poison? No? Just for me? Okay. (Walks away.)

Tag: Whatâs going on Rach?

Rachel: Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But yâknow you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?

Tag: Yâknow, Iâm actually glad Phoebe called. (He pulls out a stool and Rachel sits down.) I know we broke up because you thought I wasnât mature enough, but Iâve really grown up and think we should get back together.

Rachel: Oh, itâs just not the right time.

Tag: It is the right time. (Takes her hand.)

Rachel: Okay.

Monica: (throwing up the last present) I donât know how any of these got opened?!

Joey: (entering) You opened them all?

Joey: Oh hey! You got my parentâs gift! (Holds it up.)

Monica: Yeah. What is that?

Monica: Hey! Howâd it go?

Joey: Yeah. What-what did Tag say?

Rachel: Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?

Joey: I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you. (They hug.)

Rachel: Oh wow, you didnât even try to unhook my bra!

Monica: So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?

Rachel: No, I will. Iâm just not up for it tonight.

Joey: Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know youâre not gonna be alone in this.

Rachel: Iâm not?

Joey: Listen I uhâ¦ (He takes her hand.) Itâs a scary world out there especially if youâre a single mom. Yâknow, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Yâknow? So, (gets down on one knee again) Rachel Green will you marry me?

Rachel: What?

Monica: What?!

Phoebe: What?!!

Joey: Pheebs, give me the ring back!

Phoebe: No!!

Joey: (heartbroken) I understand.

Rachel: Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down. (Exits.)

Phoebe: I canât say that didnât hurt. But Iâll take you back Joey Tribbiani.

Joey: Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offeredâ¦

(Chandler and Ross enter with the new pictures.)

Chandler: Weâre back!

Monica: Great! Weâre hanginâ in the kitchen! (She drags him into the kitchen and turns his back to the living room) Letâs stay in the kitchen!

Chandler: Itâs picture time.

Ross: Now you are going to love these.

Chandler: (showing her the pictures) Hereâs a picture of Ross. (Shows another one.) And thatâs me. (Another one.) And thatâs me and Ross. (Another one.) Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.

Monica: Wow! That is a great picture!

Chandler: Eh?

Monica: Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags! (Throws them into his chest.)

Ross: Huh, didnât see that coming.

Chandler: Okay, so this isnât a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss withâ¦with this lady. Which by the look on your face Iâm sure youâll remember. So we donât needâ(Rips the picture)âThereâs no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.

Monica: That would be a good idea.

Chandler: Okay. (Sees the living room.) You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!

Monica: You kissed another woman!

Chandler: Call it even?!

Monica: Okay! (They high-five and he walks out.)

Ross: Well, Iâm gonna go get these (the floral bouquet he walked in with) in some water.

Phoebe: Wait you stole those from these peopleâs wedding?

Ross: No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. (Starts to leave.) Hey! My sweater! Iâve been looking for this for like a month!

(He exits leaving a stunned Phoebe and Monica.)

Monica and Phoebe: Oh my God!!

Joey: (slow on the uptake) Oh my God!

Joey: (entering) Hey!

Phoebe: Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?

Chandler: Oh.

Monica: Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.

Rachel: Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until yâknow, he screamed out Radisson at the end.

Chandler: Okay, well Iâm gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. (Joey laughs again.) 32 Joe. Youâre 32! (Exits)

[Scene: Rossâs Hotel Room, he is letting Chandler in.]

Ross: Hi.

Chandler: Hey. (He sees that Ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?

Ross: No you didnât.

Chandler: Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I saidâ¦

Ross: Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" (Chandler laughs.) Yeah, then you did that.

Chandler: So you donât have the cameras?!

Ross: No. Sorry man.

Chandler: So? What? What? Theyâre gone! Monicaâs gonna freak!

Ross: Well, Iâm sure theyâre still somewhere here in the hotel. Iâll-Iâll help you look for them.

Chandler: Great.

Phoebe: Hey!

Monica: Hey!

Phoebe: Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?

Monica: No! (Pause) But, theyâre callinâ out to me! I mean this little guy (Holds up a small one) even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldnât mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?

Phoebe: A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.

(Monica opens it anyways.)

Monica: A tiny salt shaker!!!

Phoebe: Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!

Monica: Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.

Phoebe: Oh yeah.

Monica: Good. Okay, Iâm just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.

Phoebe: Okay.

Monica: Whew. Although yâknow, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I meanâ¦ I guess yâknow it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?

Phoebe: Well I guess itâs okay to open one more if itâs part of a set. Yâknow, itâs probably this one. (Grabs another small one.)

Monica: Or this one! (She grabs and starts to open the biggest present.)

Rachel: (entering) Hi.

Monica: Hey, how are you feelinâ? Any morning sickness?

Rachel: Shh-shh-shh! The guys donât know yet do they?

Monica: No! Joey and Ross donât know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebeâs pregnant.

Phoebe: Yeah thatâs right Chandler does still think Iâm pregnant. He hasnât asked me how Iâm feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course.

Rachel: Donât worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, âcause Iâm going to tell the father today.

Phoebe: Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?

Rachel: Ew! No!

Phoebe: What?! I think heâs cute.

Rachel: Well then you have his baby.

Phoebe: Believe me Iâm trying.

Monica: Wow. Yâknow it is so weird. I mean, youâre gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea whatâs gonna happen.

Phoebe: Yeah. Youâre just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. Youâre like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.

Rachel: Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.

Phoebe: Pretty big? Itâs huge! God, this guy doesnât have a clue! Heâs just walking down the street thinking, âI had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!â then bam! Heâs a father and everythingâs different.

Rachel: Well itâs only different if he wants it to be. I mean, Iâm not gonna ask him for anything.

Phoebe: Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now heâs walking around thinking, âDo I want to be a dad?â and then bam!

Monica: What was that bam?

Phoebe: I donât. He gotâ¦he-he-he-heâs hit by a bus.

Joey: (entering) Hey!

Rachel: Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?

Joey: (warily) Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! (Starts to leave) I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!

Rachel: Oh Joey! Joey! No, itâs not you! You didnât get anybody pregnant!

Joey: Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? (Pause.) Is somebody pregnant?

Phoebe: Oh yeah. Thatâs me.

Joey: Oh my God Pheebs! Youâre gonna have a baby?

Phoebe: Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, Iâm gonna have a baby! (Joey and Phoebe hug.)

Joey: Whoa, wait a minute. Whoâs the father?

Phoebe: You donât know him. Itâs not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby. (She sits down like sheâs pregnant.)

Joey: Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? âCause I will track him down and kick his ass!

Phoebe: David Lynn.

Ross: Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-oneâs turned them.

Chandler: Well this is great. Yâknow, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, sheâs really depressed.

Ross: Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?

Chandler: All my energy is going into not asking that question. I canât believe I screwed this up!

Ross: Iâm sorry man. (Formally dressed people start to enter.) Hereâs a thought. This is the same ballroom. Thereâs a band. Thereâs gonna be plenty of dressed up people.

Chandler: Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?

Ross: No-no-no, Iâm saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody elseâs faces.

Chandler: Are you serious?

Ross: Iâm just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?

Chandler: Marriage advice? Really?!

Ross: Iâm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Arenât these the same flowers?

Chandler: I donât know, Monica picked out the flowers.

Ross: What about the chairs?

Chandler: She picked those out too.

Ross: How about the place settings?

Rachel: Phoebe the father is not here okay? I havenât told him yet and I donât think I can tell him at all now!

Phoebe: Bus?

Rachel: No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!

Phoebe: Well-well but it is huge.

Rachel: I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didnât even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.

Phoebe: Youâre thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. Itâs like, itâs like ripping off this Band-Aid. (On her arm) Quick and painless, watch. (Rips it off.) Oh mother ofâ¦See?

Phoebe: I may play the fool at times, but Iâm a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wonât quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.

Rachel: Oh Godâ¦ Oh, heâs in there right now?

Phoebe: Rachel has something that she wants to tell you and umm, I believe that this is your red sweater.

Tag: No. (Unzips his coat.) This is my red sweater.

Phoebe: Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orâ¦poison? No? Just for me? Okay. (Walks away.)

Tag: Whatâs going on Rach?

Rachel: Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But yâknow you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?

Tag: Yâknow, Iâm actually glad Phoebe called. (He pulls out a stool and Rachel sits down.) I know we broke up because you thought I wasnât mature enough, but Iâve really grown up and think we should get back together.

Rachel: Oh, itâs just not the right time.

Tag: It is the right time. (Takes her hand.)

Rachel: Okay.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Obsessive Monica has finished opening all the presents. Sheâs ashamed of this, at least, because as someone entersâ¦]

Monica: (throwing up the last present) I donât know how any of these got opened?!

Joey: (entering) You opened them all?

Monica: I know! I know! I am a terrible person! I mean, Chandler is never going to trust me with anything ever again!

Joey: Oh hey! You got my parentâs gift! (Holds it up.)

Monica: Yeah. What is that?

Joey: Well, I donât know. I think it does something to salami.

(Phoebe and Rachel enter.)

Monica: Hey! Howâd it go?

Joey: Yeah. What-what did Tag say?

Rachel: Tag is not the father! And Joey knows now?

Joey: I do Rach. I do, and I so happy for you. (They hug.)

Rachel: Oh wow, you didnât even try to unhook my bra!

Monica: So are you ever gonna tell whoever it is?

Rachel: No, I will. Iâm just not up for it tonight.

Joey: Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know youâre not gonna be alone in this.

Rachel: Iâm not?

Joey: Listen I uhâ¦ (He takes her hand.) Itâs a scary world out there especially if youâre a single mom. Yâknow, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Yâknow? So, (gets down on one knee again) Rachel Green will you marry me?

Rachel: What?

Monica: What?!

Phoebe: What?!!

Joey: Pheebs, give me the ring back!

Phoebe: No!!

Rachel: No! Joey, oh youâre so sweet. Youâre so-so sweet, honey. But Iâm not, Iâm not looking for a husband.

Joey: (heartbroken) I understand.

Rachel: Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down. (Exits.)

Phoebe: I canât say that didnât hurt. But Iâll take you back Joey Tribbiani.

Joey: Uh yeah. Pheebs, listen about that. I only offeredâ¦

Phoebe: Ooh! A Salami Buddy!

Joey: There you go!

(Chandler and Ross enter with the new pictures.)

Chandler: Weâre back!

Monica: Great! Weâre hanginâ in the kitchen! (She drags him into the kitchen and turns his back to the living room) Letâs stay in the kitchen!

Chandler: Itâs picture time.

Ross: Now you are going to love these.

Chandler: (showing her the pictures) Hereâs a picture of Ross. (Shows another one.) And thatâs me. (Another one.) And thatâs me and Ross. (Another one.) Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.

Monica: Wow! That is a great picture!

Chandler: Eh?

Monica: Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags! (Throws them into his chest.)

Ross: Huh, didnât see that coming.

Chandler: Okay, so this isnât a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss withâ¦with this lady. Which by the look on your face Iâm sure youâll remember. So we donât needâ(Rips the picture)âThereâs no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.

Monica: That would be a good idea.

Chandler: Okay. (Sees the living room.) You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!

Monica: You kissed another woman!

Chandler: Call it even?!

Monica: Okay! (They high-five and he walks out.)

Ross: Well, Iâm gonna go get these (the floral bouquet he walked in with) in some water.

Phoebe: Wait you stole those from these peopleâs wedding?

Ross: No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. (Starts to leave.) Hey! My sweater! Iâve been looking for this for like a month!

(He exits leaving a stunned Phoebe and Monica.)

Monica and Phoebe: Oh my God!!

Joey: (slow on the uptake) Oh my God!

Ross: Yeah. SheâWell, sheâs one crazy lady?

Tag: So whose is it?

End
[Scene: The Hotel Lobby, Rachel and Phoebe are at the front desk checking out.]

Joey: (entering) Hey!

Phoebe: Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?

Joey: No. (Phoebe grabs the receipt and shows it to Joey who gets mad.) I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!

(Chandler and Monica enter.)

Chandler: (to the front desk clerk) Hi! Weâre checking out of the bridal suite.

Monica: (depressed) Thatâs right. Iâm no longer a bride. Iâll never be a bride again. Now, Iâm just someoneâs wife!

Chandler: And Iâm the happiest guy in the world! (Monica goes and sits down in a huff.) Oh honey, come on donât be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!

Monica: Oh yeah, right. (Rolls her eyes.)

Chandler: We got the honeymoon.

Monica: Thatâs not âtil Thursday.

Chandler: The wedding pictures?

Monica: They wonât be ready for weeks.

Chandler: Not the disposable cameras from the tables.

Monica: Thatâs true! (Happily) I knew I married you for a reason!

Chandler: Iâll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.

Monica: Okay.

(Joey giggles.)

Chandler: What? What did you take a picture of?

Joey: Nothing! It was something.

Chandler: Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?

Rachel: Are you joking? Check out is not âtil noon and he has a good (checks her watch) eleven minutes left.

Chandler: Oh.

Monica: Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.

Rachel: Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until yâknow, he screamed out Radisson at the end.

Chandler: Okay, well Iâm gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. (Joey laughs again.) 32 Joe. Youâre 32! (Exits)

Opening Credits

[Scene: Rossâs Hotel Room, he is letting Chandler in.]

Ross: Hi.

Chandler: Hey. (He sees that Ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?

Ross: Why not? Itâs built into the price of the room.

Chandler: Yeah but you donât needâ(Picks up something)âWhat is this?

Ross: Thread!

Chandler: Score! Where are the disposable cameras?

Ross: What disposable cameras?

Chandler: The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?

Ross: No you didnât.

Chandler: Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I saidâ¦

Ross: Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" (Chandler laughs.) Yeah, then you did that.

Chandler: So you donât have the cameras?!

Ross: No. Sorry man.

Chandler: So? What? What? Theyâre gone! Monicaâs gonna freak!

Ross: Well, Iâm sure theyâre still somewhere here in the hotel. Iâll-Iâll help you look for them.

Chandler: Great.

Ross: In-in three minutes.

(Chandler goes into the bathroom, closes the door, and then opens it again right away. Ross looks up and hands him the toilet paper Ross already packed.)

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe is entering to see Monica sitting in front of a mound of wedding gifts.]

Phoebe: Hey!

Monica: Hey!

Phoebe: Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?

Monica: No! (Pause) But, theyâre callinâ out to me! I mean this little guy (Holds up a small one) even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldnât mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?

Phoebe: A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.

(Monica opens it anyways.)

Monica: A tiny salt shaker!!!

Phoebe: Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!

Monica: Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.

Phoebe: Oh yeah.

Monica: Good. Okay, Iâm just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.

Phoebe: Okay.

Monica: Whew. Although yâknow, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I meanâ¦ I guess yâknow it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?

Phoebe: Well I guess itâs okay to open one more if itâs part of a set. Yâknow, itâs probably this one. (Grabs another small one.)

Monica: Or this one! (She grabs and starts to open the biggest present.)

Rachel: (entering) Hi.

Monica: Hey, how are you feelinâ? Any morning sickness?

Rachel: Shh-shh-shh! The guys donât know yet do they?

Monica: No! Joey and Ross donât know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebeâs pregnant.

Phoebe: Yeah thatâs right Chandler does still think Iâm pregnant. He hasnât asked me how Iâm feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course.

Rachel: Donât worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, âcause Iâm going to tell the father today.

Phoebe: Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?

Rachel: Ew! No!

Phoebe: What?! I think heâs cute.

Rachel: Well then you have his baby.

Phoebe: Believe me Iâm trying.

Monica: Wow. Yâknow it is so weird. I mean, youâre gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea whatâs gonna happen.

Phoebe: Yeah. Youâre just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. Youâre like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.

Rachel: Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.

Phoebe: Pretty big? Itâs huge! God, this guy doesnât have a clue! Heâs just walking down the street thinking, âI had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!â then bam! Heâs a father and everythingâs different.

Rachel: Well itâs only different if he wants it to be. I mean, Iâm not gonna ask him for anything.

Phoebe: Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now heâs walking around thinking, âDo I want to be a dad?â and then bam!

Monica: What was that bam?

Phoebe: I donât. He gotâ¦he-he-he-heâs hit by a bus.

Joey: (entering) Hey!

Rachel: Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?

Joey: (warily) Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! (Starts to leave) I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!

Rachel: Oh Joey! Joey! No, itâs not you! You didnât get anybody pregnant!

Joey: Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? (Pause.) Is somebody pregnant?

Phoebe: Oh yeah. Thatâs me.

Joey: Oh my God Pheebs! Youâre gonna have a baby?

Phoebe: Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, Iâm gonna have a baby! (Joey and Phoebe hug.)

Joey: Whoa, wait a minute. Whoâs the father?

Phoebe: You donât know him. Itâs not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby. (She sits down like sheâs pregnant.)

Joey: Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? âCause I will track him down and kick his ass!

Phoebe: David Lynn.

Joey: David Lynn! David Lynn! David Lynn!! (Exits)

Monica: Whoâs David Lynn?

Phoebe: Oh some guy from my gym. A little annoying.

Chandler: Yes! And thatâs why Iâm under the table. Celebrating.

Ross: Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-oneâs turned them.

Chandler: Well this is great. Yâknow, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, sheâs really depressed.

Ross: Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?

Chandler: All my energy is going into not asking that question. I canât believe I screwed this up!

Ross: Iâm sorry man. (Formally dressed people start to enter.) Hereâs a thought. This is the same ballroom. Thereâs a band. Thereâs gonna be plenty of dressed up people.

Chandler: Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?

Ross: No-no-no, Iâm saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody elseâs faces.

Chandler: Are you serious?

Ross: Iâm just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?

Chandler: Marriage advice? Really?!

Ross: Iâm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Arenât these the same flowers?

Chandler: I donât know, Monica picked out the flowers.

Ross: What about the chairs?

Chandler: She picked those out too.

Ross: How about the place settings?

Chandler: That was her.

Rachel: No! Phoebe, itâs not Gunther.

Phoebe: Thank God, âcause that hair on a babyâ¦

Rachel: Phoebe the father is not here okay? I havenât told him yet and I donât think I can tell him at all now!

Phoebe: Why not?

Rachel: I donât know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking, âIâm gonna tell the father todayâ and then bam!

Phoebe: Bus?

Rachel: No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!

Phoebe: Well-well but it is huge.

Rachel: I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didnât even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.

Phoebe: Youâre thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. Itâs like, itâs like ripping off this Band-Aid. (On her arm) Quick and painless, watch. (Rips it off.) Oh mother ofâ¦See?

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Obsessive Monica has now opened more of the wedding gifts.]

Joey: (entering) Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?

Joey: Umm, now uhâ¦ Itâs a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Yâknow, now I always thought you and I had a special bond soâ¦ (He goes to one knee and pulls out a ring.) Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

Monica: Oh my God! Joey!

Phoebe: Hell yeah! Iâll marry you! (She grabs the ring and puts it on.)

Monica: You canât marry him!

Phoebe: Hey lady, your dayâs over! Itâs my turn!

Monica: Phoebe!

Joey: Why?! Why canât she marry me?!

Phoebe: I can and I will! (Kisses him.)

Monica: Sheâs not pregnant. Itâs Rachel. Rachelâs the one whoâs pregnant.

Rachel: What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?

Phoebe: I may play the fool at times, but Iâm a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wonât quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.

Rachel: Oh Godâ¦ Oh, heâs in there right now?

Phoebe: Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?

Phoebe: Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orâ¦poison? No? Just for me? Okay. (Walks away.)

Tag: Whatâs going on Rach?

Rachel: Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But yâknow you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?

Tag: Yâknow, Iâm actually glad Phoebe called. (He pulls out a stool and Rachel sits down.) I know we broke up because you thought I wasnât mature enough, but Iâve really grown up and think we should get back together.

Rachel: Oh, itâs just not the right time.

Tag: It is the right time. (Takes her hand.)

Rachel: No! Joey, oh youâre so sweet. Youâre so-so sweet, honey. But Iâm not, Iâm not looking for a husband.

Joey: (heartbroken) I understand.

Rachel: Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down. (Exits.)

Phoebe: I canât say that didnât hurt. But Iâll take you back Joey Tribbiani.

Chandler: (showing her the pictures) Hereâs a picture of Ross. (Shows another one.) And thatâs me. (Another one.) And thatâs me and Ross. (Another one.) Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.

Monica: Wow! That is a great picture!

Chandler: Eh?

Monica: Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags! (Throws them into his chest.)

Ross: Huh, didnât see that coming.

Chandler: Okay, so this isnât a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss withâ¦with this lady. Which by the look on your face Iâm sure youâll remember. So we donât needâ(Rips the picture)âThereâs no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.

Monica: That would be a good idea.

Chandler: Okay. (Sees the living room.) You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!

Monica: You kissed another woman!

Chandler: Call it even?!

Monica: Okay! (They high-five and he walks out.)

Ross: Well, Iâm gonna go get these (the floral bouquet he walked in with) in some water.

Phoebe: Wait you stole those from these peopleâs wedding?

Ross: No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. (Starts to leave.) Hey! My sweater! Iâve been looking for this for like a month!

(He exits leaving a stunned Phoebe and Monica.)

Joey: (entering) Hey!

Phoebe: Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?

Chandler: Oh.

Monica: Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.

Rachel: Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until yâknow, he screamed out Radisson at the end.

Chandler: Okay, well Iâm gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. (Joey laughs again.) 32 Joe. Youâre 32! (Exits)

[Scene: Rossâs Hotel Room, he is letting Chandler in.]

Ross: Hi.

Chandler: Hey. (He sees that Ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?

Ross: Why not? Itâs built into the price of the room.

Chandler: Yeah but you donât needâ(Picks up something)âWhat is this?

Chandler: The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?

Ross: No you didnât.

Chandler: Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I saidâ¦

Ross: Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" (Chandler laughs.) Yeah, then you did that.

Chandler: So you donât have the cameras?!

Ross: No. Sorry man.

Chandler: So? What? What? Theyâre gone! Monicaâs gonna freak!

Ross: Well, Iâm sure theyâre still somewhere here in the hotel. Iâll-Iâll help you look for them.

Chandler: Great.

Ross: In-in three minutes.

(Chandler goes into the bathroom, closes the door, and then opens it again right away. Ross looks up and hands him the toilet paper Ross already packed.)

Phoebe: Hey!

Monica: Hey!

Phoebe: Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?

Monica: No! (Pause) But, theyâre callinâ out to me! I mean this little guy (Holds up a small one) even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldnât mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?

Phoebe: A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.

(Monica opens it anyways.)

Monica: A tiny salt shaker!!!

Phoebe: Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!

Monica: Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.

Phoebe: Oh yeah.

Monica: Good. Okay, Iâm just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.

Phoebe: Okay.

Monica: Whew. Although yâknow, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I meanâ¦ I guess yâknow it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?

Phoebe: Well I guess itâs okay to open one more if itâs part of a set. Yâknow, itâs probably this one. (Grabs another small one.)

Monica: Or this one! (She grabs and starts to open the biggest present.)

Rachel: (entering) Hi.

Monica: Hey, how are you feelinâ? Any morning sickness?

Rachel: Shh-shh-shh! The guys donât know yet do they?

Monica: No! Joey and Ross donât know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebeâs pregnant.

Phoebe: Yeah thatâs right Chandler does still think Iâm pregnant. He hasnât asked me how Iâm feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course.

Rachel: Donât worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, âcause Iâm going to tell the father today.

Phoebe: Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?

Rachel: Ew! No!

Phoebe: What?! I think heâs cute.

Rachel: Well then you have his baby.

Phoebe: Believe me Iâm trying.

Monica: Wow. Yâknow it is so weird. I mean, youâre gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea whatâs gonna happen.

Phoebe: Yeah. Youâre just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. Youâre like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.

Rachel: Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.

Phoebe: Pretty big? Itâs huge! God, this guy doesnât have a clue! Heâs just walking down the street thinking, âI had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!â then bam! Heâs a father and everythingâs different.

Rachel: Well itâs only different if he wants it to be. I mean, Iâm not gonna ask him for anything.

Phoebe: Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now heâs walking around thinking, âDo I want to be a dad?â and then bam!

Monica: What was that bam?

Phoebe: I donât. He gotâ¦he-he-he-heâs hit by a bus.

Joey: (entering) Hey!

Rachel: Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?

Joey: (warily) Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! (Starts to leave) I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!

Rachel: Oh Joey! Joey! No, itâs not you! You didnât get anybody pregnant!

Joey: Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? (Pause.) Is somebody pregnant?

Phoebe: Oh yeah. Thatâs me.

Joey: Oh my God Pheebs! Youâre gonna have a baby?

Phoebe: Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, Iâm gonna have a baby! (Joey and Phoebe hug.)

Joey: Whoa, wait a minute. Whoâs the father?

Phoebe: You donât know him. Itâs not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby. (She sits down like sheâs pregnant.)

Joey: Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? âCause I will track him down and kick his ass!

Ross: Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-oneâs turned them.

Chandler: Well this is great. Yâknow, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, sheâs really depressed.

Ross: Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?

Chandler: All my energy is going into not asking that question. I canât believe I screwed this up!

Ross: Iâm sorry man. (Formally dressed people start to enter.) Hereâs a thought. This is the same ballroom. Thereâs a band. Thereâs gonna be plenty of dressed up people.

Chandler: Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?

Ross: No-no-no, Iâm saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody elseâs faces.

Chandler: Are you serious?

Ross: Iâm just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?

Chandler: Marriage advice? Really?!

Ross: Iâm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Arenât these the same flowers?

Chandler: I donât know, Monica picked out the flowers.

Ross: What about the chairs?

Chandler: She picked those out too.

Ross: How about the place settings?

Rachel: Phoebe the father is not here okay? I havenât told him yet and I donât think I can tell him at all now!

Phoebe: Bus?

Rachel: No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!

Phoebe: Well-well but it is huge.

Rachel: I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didnât even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.

Phoebe: Youâre thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. Itâs like, itâs like ripping off this Band-Aid. (On her arm) Quick and painless, watch. (Rips it off.) Oh mother ofâ¦See?

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Obsessive Monica has now opened more of the wedding gifts.]

Monica: Phoebe!

Joey: Why?! Why canât she marry me?!

Phoebe: I can and I will! (Kisses him.)

Phoebe: Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!

Rachel: What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?

Phoebe: I may play the fool at times, but Iâm a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wonât quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.

Rachel: Oh Godâ¦ Oh, heâs in there right now?

Phoebe: Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?

Phoebe: Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orâ¦poison? No? Just for me? Okay. (Walks away.)

Tag: Whatâs going on Rach?

Rachel: Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But yâknow you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?

Tag: Yâknow, Iâm actually glad Phoebe called. (He pulls out a stool and Rachel sits down.) I know we broke up because you thought I wasnât mature enough, but Iâve really grown up and think we should get back together.

Rachel: Oh, itâs just not the right time.

Tag: It is the right time. (Takes her hand.)

Joey: Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know youâre not gonna be alone in this.

Rachel: Iâm not?

Joey: Listen I uhâ¦ (He takes her hand.) Itâs a scary world out there especially if youâre a single mom. Yâknow, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Yâknow? So, (gets down on one knee again) Rachel Green will you marry me?

Rachel: What?

Chandler: Eh?

Monica: Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags! (Throws them into his chest.)

Ross: Huh, didnât see that coming.

Chandler: Okay, so this isnât a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss withâ¦with this lady. Which by the look on your face Iâm sure youâll remember. So we donât needâ(Rips the picture)âThereâs no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.

Monica: That would be a good idea.

Chandler: Okay. (Sees the living room.) You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!

Joey: (entering) Hey!

Phoebe: Oh! Joey uh, were you in our room last night?

Joey: No. (Phoebe grabs the receipt and shows it to Joey who gets mad.) I was told the name of the movie would not appear on the bill!

(Chandler and Monica enter.)

Chandler: (to the front desk clerk) Hi! Weâre checking out of the bridal suite.

Monica: (depressed) Thatâs right. Iâm no longer a bride. Iâll never be a bride again. Now, Iâm just someoneâs wife!

Chandler: And Iâm the happiest guy in the world! (Monica goes and sits down in a huff.) Oh honey, come on donât be upset. We still have so much to look forward to!

Monica: Oh yeah, right. (Rolls her eyes.)

Chandler: We got the honeymoon.

Monica: Thatâs not âtil Thursday.

Chandler: The wedding pictures?

Monica: They wonât be ready for weeks.

Chandler: Not the disposable cameras from the tables.

Monica: Thatâs true! (Happily) I knew I married you for a reason!

Chandler: Iâll tell you what, I will go get them developed and you can go home.

Monica: Okay.

(Joey giggles.)

Chandler: What? What did you take a picture of?

Joey: Nothing! It was something.

Chandler: Okay Ross has the cameras, has he checked out yet?

Rachel: Are you joking? Check out is not âtil noon and he has a good (checks her watch) eleven minutes left.

Chandler: Oh.

Monica: Ross has never checked out of a room a minute before he had to.

Rachel: Yeah, one time, when we were dating, uh we got a late checkout, he got so excited it was the best sex we ever had. Until yâknow, he screamed out Radisson at the end.

Chandler: Okay, well Iâm gonna get Ross, get the cameras, and get them developed. (Joey laughs again.) 32 Joe. Youâre 32! (Exits)

Front Desk Clerk: (To Monica) Hereâs a copy of your bill.

Opening Credits

[Scene: Rossâs Hotel Room, he is letting Chandler in.]

Ross: Hi.

Chandler: Hey. (He sees that Ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?

Ross: Why not? Itâs built into the price of the room.

Chandler: Yeah but you donât needâ(Picks up something)âWhat is this?

Ross: Thread!

Chandler: Score! Where are the disposable cameras?

Chandler: The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?

Ross: No you didnât.

Chandler: Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I saidâ¦

Ross: Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" (Chandler laughs.) Yeah, then you did that.

Chandler: So you donât have the cameras?!

Ross: No. Sorry man.

Chandler: So? What? What? Theyâre gone! Monicaâs gonna freak!

Ross: Well, Iâm sure theyâre still somewhere here in the hotel. Iâll-Iâll help you look for them.

Chandler: Great.

Ross: In-in three minutes.

(Chandler goes into the bathroom, closes the door, and then opens it again right away. Ross looks up and hands him the toilet paper Ross already packed.)

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe is entering to see Monica sitting in front of a mound of wedding gifts.]

Phoebe: Hey!

Monica: Hey!

Phoebe: Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?

Monica: No! (Pause) But, theyâre callinâ out to me! I mean this little guy (Holds up a small one) even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldnât mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?

Phoebe: A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.

(Monica opens it anyways.)

Monica: A tiny salt shaker!!!

Phoebe: Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!

Monica: Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.

Phoebe: Oh yeah.

Monica: Good. Okay, Iâm just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.

Phoebe: Okay.

Monica: Whew. Although yâknow, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I meanâ¦ I guess yâknow it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?

Phoebe: Well I guess itâs okay to open one more if itâs part of a set. Yâknow, itâs probably this one. (Grabs another small one.)

Monica: Or this one! (She grabs and starts to open the biggest present.)

Rachel: (entering) Hi.

Monica: Hey, how are you feelinâ? Any morning sickness?

Rachel: Shh-shh-shh! The guys donât know yet do they?

Monica: No! Joey and Ross donât know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebeâs pregnant.

Phoebe: Yeah thatâs right Chandler does still think Iâm pregnant. He hasnât asked me how Iâm feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course.

Rachel: Donât worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, âcause Iâm going to tell the father today.

Phoebe: Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?

Rachel: Ew! No!

Phoebe: What?! I think heâs cute.

Rachel: Well then you have his baby.

Phoebe: Believe me Iâm trying.

Monica: Wow. Yâknow it is so weird. I mean, youâre gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea whatâs gonna happen.

Phoebe: Yeah. Youâre just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. Youâre like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.

Rachel: Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.

Phoebe: Pretty big? Itâs huge! God, this guy doesnât have a clue! Heâs just walking down the street thinking, âI had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!â then bam! Heâs a father and everythingâs different.

Rachel: Well itâs only different if he wants it to be. I mean, Iâm not gonna ask him for anything.

Phoebe: Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now heâs walking around thinking, âDo I want to be a dad?â and then bam!

Monica: What was that bam?

Phoebe: I donât. He gotâ¦he-he-he-heâs hit by a bus.

Joey: (entering) Hey!

Rachel: Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?

Joey: (warily) Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! (Starts to leave) I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!

Rachel: Oh Joey! Joey! No, itâs not you! You didnât get anybody pregnant!

Joey: Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? (Pause.) Is somebody pregnant?

Phoebe: Oh yeah. Thatâs me.

Joey: Oh my God Pheebs! Youâre gonna have a baby?

Phoebe: Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, Iâm gonna have a baby! (Joey and Phoebe hug.)

Joey: Whoa, wait a minute. Whoâs the father?

Phoebe: You donât know him. Itâs not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby. (She sits down like sheâs pregnant.)

Joey: Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? âCause I will track him down and kick his ass!

Ross: Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-oneâs turned them.

Chandler: Well this is great. Yâknow, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, sheâs really depressed.

Ross: Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?

Chandler: All my energy is going into not asking that question. I canât believe I screwed this up!

Ross: Iâm sorry man. (Formally dressed people start to enter.) Hereâs a thought. This is the same ballroom. Thereâs a band. Thereâs gonna be plenty of dressed up people.

Chandler: Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?

Ross: No-no-no, Iâm saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody elseâs faces.

Chandler: Are you serious?

Ross: Iâm just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?

Chandler: Marriage advice? Really?!

Ross: Iâm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Arenât these the same flowers?

Chandler: I donât know, Monica picked out the flowers.

Ross: What about the chairs?

Chandler: She picked those out too.

Ross: How about the place settings?

Rachel: No! Phoebe, itâs not Gunther.

Phoebe: Thank God, âcause that hair on a babyâ¦

Rachel: Phoebe the father is not here okay? I havenât told him yet and I donât think I can tell him at all now!

Phoebe: Why not?

Rachel: I donât know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking, âIâm gonna tell the father todayâ and then bam!

Phoebe: Bus?

Rachel: No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!

Phoebe: Well-well but it is huge.

Rachel: I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didnât even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.

Phoebe: Youâre thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. Itâs like, itâs like ripping off this Band-Aid. (On her arm) Quick and painless, watch. (Rips it off.) Oh mother ofâ¦See?

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Obsessive Monica has now opened more of the wedding gifts.]

Joey: (entering) Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?

Joey: Umm, now uhâ¦ Itâs a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Yâknow, now I always thought you and I had a special bond soâ¦ (He goes to one knee and pulls out a ring.) Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

Monica: Oh my God! Joey!

Phoebe: Hell yeah! Iâll marry you! (She grabs the ring and puts it on.)

Phoebe: Hey lady, your dayâs over! Itâs my turn!

Monica: Phoebe!

Joey: Why?! Why canât she marry me?!

Phoebe: I can and I will! (Kisses him.)

Monica: Sheâs not pregnant. Itâs Rachel. Rachelâs the one whoâs pregnant.

Phoebe: Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!

Rachel: What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?

Phoebe: I may play the fool at times, but Iâm a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wonât quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.

Rachel: Oh Godâ¦ Oh, heâs in there right now?

Phoebe: Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?

Phoebe: Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orâ¦poison? No? Just for me? Okay. (Walks away.)

Tag: Whatâs going on Rach?

Rachel: Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But yâknow you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?

Tag: Yâknow, Iâm actually glad Phoebe called. (He pulls out a stool and Rachel sits down.) I know we broke up because you thought I wasnât mature enough, but Iâve really grown up and think we should get back together.

Rachel: Oh, itâs just not the right time.

Tag: It is the right time. (Takes her hand.)

Joey: Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know youâre not gonna be alone in this.

Rachel: Iâm not?

Joey: Listen I uhâ¦ (He takes her hand.) Itâs a scary world out there especially if youâre a single mom. Yâknow, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Yâknow? So, (gets down on one knee again) Rachel Green will you marry me?

Rachel: What?

Chandler: Eh?

Monica: Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags! (Throws them into his chest.)

Ross: Huh, didnât see that coming.

Chandler: Okay, so this isnât a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss withâ¦with this lady. Which by the look on your face Iâm sure youâll remember. So we donât needâ(Rips the picture)âThereâs no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.

Monica: That would be a good idea.

Chandler: Okay. (Sees the living room.) You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!

Monica: You kissed another woman!

Chandler: Call it even?!

Monica: Okay! (They high-five and he walks out.)

Chandler: Hey. (He sees that Ross is packing all of the hotel toiletries) Soaps? Shampoos? Are you really taking all this stuff?

Ross: Why not? Itâs built into the price of the room.

Chandler: Yeah but you donât needâ(Picks up something)âWhat is this?

Ross: Thread!

Chandler: Score! Where are the disposable cameras?

Ross: What disposable cameras?

Chandler: The cameras? Remember last night I told you to take them?

Ross: No you didnât.

Chandler: Yes! Remember? Right before we cut the cake, I went up to you and I saidâ¦

Ross: Oh-oh yeah, you-you came up to me and asked if I could do you a favor, and my Uncle Murray came up to you and handed you a check. And then you said, "Why do they call it a check? Why not a Yugoslavian?" (Chandler laughs.) Yeah, then you did that.

Chandler: So you donât have the cameras?!

Ross: No. Sorry man.

Chandler: So? What? What? Theyâre gone! Monicaâs gonna freak!

Ross: Well, Iâm sure theyâre still somewhere here in the hotel. Iâll-Iâll help you look for them.

Chandler: Great.

Ross: In-in three minutes.

(Chandler goes into the bathroom, closes the door, and then opens it again right away. Ross looks up and hands him the toilet paper Ross already packed.)

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Phoebe is entering to see Monica sitting in front of a mound of wedding gifts.]

Phoebe: Hey!

Monica: Hey!

Phoebe: Are you gonna open the presents without Chandler?

Monica: No! (Pause) But, theyâre callinâ out to me! I mean this little guy (Holds up a small one) even crawled up into my lap. Oh come on, Chandler wouldnât mind if I opened just one present! What do you think it is?

Phoebe: A little mirror that when you look into it you see yourself as an old woman.

(Monica opens it anyways.)

Monica: A tiny salt shaker!!!

Phoebe: Ohhh! My God! For tiny salt!

Monica: Oh wow! Okay. Well that was fun.

Phoebe: Oh yeah.

Monica: Good. Okay, Iâm just gonna wait for Chandler to open the rest of them.

Phoebe: Okay.

Monica: Whew. Although yâknow, this is part of a salt and pepper set. I meanâ¦ I guess yâknow it may just count as a half a present. What do you think?

Phoebe: Well I guess itâs okay to open one more if itâs part of a set. Yâknow, itâs probably this one. (Grabs another small one.)

Monica: Or this one! (She grabs and starts to open the biggest present.)

Rachel: (entering) Hi.

Monica: Hey, how are you feelinâ? Any morning sickness?

Rachel: Shh-shh-shh! The guys donât know yet do they?

Monica: No! Joey and Ross donât know anything and Chandler still thinks that Phoebeâs pregnant.

Phoebe: Yeah thatâs right Chandler does still think Iâm pregnant. He hasnât asked me how Iâm feeling or offered to carry my bags. Boy, I feel bad for the woman who ends up with him. (Monica looks at her.) After you of course.

Rachel: Donât worry I promise that you will only have to be pregnant for a few more hours, âcause Iâm going to tell the father today.

Phoebe: Ooh, is it someone in this building? Is it that tall guy from the first floor?

Rachel: Ew! No!

Phoebe: What?! I think heâs cute.

Rachel: Well then you have his baby.

Phoebe: Believe me Iâm trying.

Monica: Wow. Yâknow it is so weird. I mean, youâre gonna tell this guy today and he has no idea whatâs gonna happen.

Phoebe: Yeah. Youâre just gonna knock on his door and change his life forever. Youâre like Ed McMahon except without the big check, or the raw sexual magnetism.

Rachel: Yeah. Uh-huh, I guess it is pretty big news.

Phoebe: Pretty big? Itâs huge! God, this guy doesnât have a clue! Heâs just walking down the street thinking, âI had sex with Rachel Green. I rock!â then bam! Heâs a father and everythingâs different.

Rachel: Well itâs only different if he wants it to be. I mean, Iâm not gonna ask him for anything.

Phoebe: Okay. Then he still has this huge decision to make. Now heâs walking around thinking, âDo I want to be a dad?â and then bam!

Monica: What was that bam?

Phoebe: I donât. He gotâ¦he-he-he-heâs hit by a bus.

Joey: (entering) Hey!

Rachel: Hey Joey, what would you do if someone that you slept with told you that she was pregnant?

Joey: (warily) Who called here? Did she sound blond? Huh? Did-did-did she have an accent? I gotta make a call! (Starts to leave) I shoulda never walked into that Sunglass Hut!

Rachel: Oh Joey! Joey! No, itâs not you! You didnât get anybody pregnant!

Joey: Oh. Why would you scare me like that? What the hell is going on? (Pause.) Is somebody pregnant?

Phoebe: Oh yeah. Thatâs me.

Joey: Oh my God Pheebs! Youâre gonna have a baby?

Phoebe: Yes. Yes I am. Oh my God, Iâm gonna have a baby! (Joey and Phoebe hug.)

Joey: Whoa, wait a minute. Whoâs the father?

Phoebe: You donât know him. Itâs not important. He wants nothing to do with me or the baby. (She sits down like sheâs pregnant.)

Joey: Well who is this guy?! Huh? Who is he? âCause I will track him down and kick his ass!

Phoebe: David Lynn.

Chandler: Yes! And thatâs why Iâm under the table. Celebrating.

Ross: Well I checked in the uh, lost and found, I talked to the manager, no-oneâs turned them.

Chandler: Well this is great. Yâknow, those cameras were the only thing that was gonna cheer Monica up today, sheâs really depressed.

Ross: Now you guys just got married, why is she so depressed?

Chandler: All my energy is going into not asking that question. I canât believe I screwed this up!

Ross: Iâm sorry man. (Formally dressed people start to enter.) Hereâs a thought. This is the same ballroom. Thereâs a band. Thereâs gonna be plenty of dressed up people.

Chandler: Are you suggesting we dance our troubles away?

Ross: No-no-no, Iâm saying we-we buy more of this (disposable cameras) at the gift shop, throw our tuxes back on, and take a few pictures. All we have to do is make sure not to get anybody elseâs faces.

Chandler: Are you serious?

Ross: Iâm just thinking about your new bride at home. Okay? Do-do you really want to start your life together by letting her down?

Chandler: Marriage advice? Really?!

Ross: Iâm telling you, this looks exactly like your wedding! Arenât these the same flowers?

Chandler: I donât know, Monica picked out the flowers.

Ross: What about the chairs?

Chandler: She picked those out too.

Ross: How about the place settings?

Chandler: That was her.

Ross: What did you do?

Rachel: No! Phoebe, itâs not Gunther.

Phoebe: Thank God, âcause that hair on a babyâ¦

Rachel: Phoebe the father is not here okay? I havenât told him yet and I donât think I can tell him at all now!

Phoebe: Why not?

Rachel: I donât know, let me think. I was walking down the street thinking, âIâm gonna tell the father todayâ and then bam!

Phoebe: Bus?

Rachel: No, you! Phoebe you freaked me out. You kept saying how huge this all is!

Phoebe: Well-well but it is huge.

Rachel: I know, but I was just thinking about how huge this is for me. I didnât even go to how huge this was going to be for the father.

Phoebe: Youâre thinking about this way too much. Just tell him and get it over with. Itâs like, itâs like ripping off this Band-Aid. (On her arm) Quick and painless, watch. (Rips it off.) Oh mother ofâ¦See?

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Obsessive Monica has now opened more of the wedding gifts.]

Joey: (entering) Ooh-ooh-ooh! Are we opening presents?

Phoebe: All right. (She sits down like sheâs pregnant again.)

Joey: Umm, now uhâ¦ Itâs a scary world out there, especially for a single mom. Yâknow, now I always thought you and I had a special bond soâ¦ (He goes to one knee and pulls out a ring.) Phoebe Buffay, will you marry me?

Monica: Oh my God! Joey!

Phoebe: Hell yeah! Iâll marry you! (She grabs the ring and puts it on.)

Monica: You canât marry him!

Phoebe: Hey lady, your dayâs over! Itâs my turn!

Monica: Phoebe!

Joey: Why?! Why canât she marry me?!

Phoebe: I can and I will! (Kisses him.)

Monica: Sheâs not pregnant. Itâs Rachel. Rachelâs the one whoâs pregnant.

Joey: Oh my God.

Phoebe: Hey!

Monica: Phoebe I think he would notice if you didnât have a baby in nine months!

Phoebe: Itâs Joey! (Joey turns and looks at her and she mouths âI love youâ to him.)

Joey: (smiles then stops) Now I canât believe it! What? Rachelâs pregnant? (The girls nod yes.) Whoâs the father?

Phoebe: We donât know.

Joey: Ohhâ¦ I wonder if that dude.

Monica: Thereâs a dude?

Joey: Yeah.

Phoebe: Who? Who is it?

Joey: About a month ago this guy spent the night with Rachel, I didnât see who it was butâ¦ (He walks out and closes the door.)

Phoebe: Was that story over?

[Scene: Outside Central Perk, Rachel and Phoebe are about to go inside.]

Phoebe: Look, I feel really bad about how I freaked you out before, so I called the father and asked him to meet you here so you can tell him. Go!

Rachel: What? Hey wait a minute! Phoebe, how do you even know who the father is?

Phoebe: I may play the fool at times, but Iâm a little more than a pretty blond girl with an ass that wonât quit. (She takes the sweater out of her purse.) I believe this belongs to the father of your baby.

Rachel: Oh Godâ¦ Oh, heâs in there right now?

Phoebe: Uh-huh. Now you can turn around or you can go in there and rip the Band-Aid off. What to you want to do?

Rachel: Uh, letâs rip!

Phoebe: Oh no. Could I get anyone a coffee orâ¦poison? No? Just for me? Okay. (Walks away.)

Tag: Whatâs going on Rach?

Rachel: Nothing! Phoebe kinda made a mistake. But yâknow you do wear that sweater a lot, are you involved in some kind of dare?

Tag: Yâknow, Iâm actually glad Phoebe called. (He pulls out a stool and Rachel sits down.) I know we broke up because you thought I wasnât mature enough, but Iâve really grown up and think we should get back together.

Rachel: Oh, itâs just not the right time.

Tag: It is the right time. (Takes her hand.)

Joey: Hey Rach listen, no matter what this guy says I want you to know youâre not gonna be alone in this.

Rachel: Iâm not?

Joey: Listen I uhâ¦ (He takes her hand.) Itâs a scary world out there especially if youâre a single mom. Yâknow, I always felt like you and I have this-this special bond. Yâknow? So, (gets down on one knee again) Rachel Green will you marry me?

Rachel: What?

Monica: What?!

Phoebe: What?!!

Rachel: Now, if you will excuse me I am going to go and lie down. (Exits.)

Chandler: Itâs picture time.

Ross: Now you are going to love these.

Chandler: (showing her the pictures) Hereâs a picture of Ross. (Shows another one.) And thatâs me. (Another one.) And thatâs me and Ross. (Another one.) Oh-ho, that is a picture of our first kiss as a married couple.

Monica: Wow! That is a great picture!

Chandler: Eh?

Monica: Yeah! Oh and interesting because I found the cameras in one of our bags! (Throws them into his chest.)

Ross: Huh, didnât see that coming.

Chandler: Okay, so this isnât a picture of our first, but it is a picture of my first kiss withâ¦with this lady. Which by the look on your face Iâm sure youâll remember. So we donât needâ(Rips the picture)âThereâs no need to have this picture. How about I take the real pictures and get them developed right now.

Monica: That would be a good idea.

Chandler: Okay. (Sees the living room.) You opened all the presents without me?! I thought we were supposed to do that together!

Monica: You kissed another woman!

Chandler: Call it even?!

Monica: Okay! (They high-five and he walks out.)

Ross: Well, Iâm gonna go get these (the floral bouquet he walked in with) in some water.

Phoebe: Wait you stole those from these peopleâs wedding?

Ross: No-no, I took them from the hotel lobby. Yeah, they think they can charge me for some dirty movie and a bag of Mashuga nuts, they got another think coming. (Starts to leave.) Hey! My sweater! Iâve been looking for this for like a month!

(He exits leaving a stunned Phoebe and Monica.)

Ross: Well, we-we said weâd just do it that one time but, but now I think she may wanna start things up again.

Joey: Yeah, I donât think thatâs what it is.

Ross: Why? What-what else could it be?

Joey: Oh wow, I donât feel well.

Ross: Iâm telling you. Iâm telling you. Thatâs what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didnât say anything to you?

Phoebe: (To Joey) Maybe itâs something you ate?

Joey: Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.

Ross: Yeah, I guess I should. (Starts to leave.) Man, yâknow what I have to realize? Maybe Iâm just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Yâknow, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. (He pauses and then exits.)

Mr. Treeger: You said there was a gas leak in here.

Phoebe: Well why donât you use your key?

Mr. Treeger: Because by the time I find it on this thing (Holds up a huge key ring with a thousand keys on it), the whole place might have exploded. If that happens at another building that I manage, people are gonna start asking questions. (To the fireman) Come on! Hurry up.

(With a final swing the door gives way.)

Rachel: Seriously. What?!

Ross: Okay. Okay. Yâknow what? If you want to, we can do it one more time. I mean Iâd-Iâd be okay with that. In fact, I have some time right now.

Rachel: I know. I know, but yâknow condoms only work like 97% of the time.

Ross: What? What? What?!! Well they should put that on the box!!!

Rachel: They do!

Ross: No they donât!!! (He runs to the bedroom to check and returns with his box of condoms.) Well they should put it in huge black letters!!!!

Rachel: Okay Ross come on letâs just forget about the condoms.

Ross: Oh well I may as well have!

Mr. Treeger: Anyway uh, Iâll get moving on that new door.

Phoebe: Oh great! And listen, could you do us a favor and not tell Chandler and Monica about this? âCause yâknow umm, they donât-they donât have any kids of their own and-and this door was like a child to them.

Mr. Treeger: Well Iâm gonna have to put on a new lock, theyâll find out anyway.

Ross: You already know donât you?

Phoebe: A little bit.

Joey: How are you doing?

Ross: Okay. Okay. I mean Iâll be okay. Itâs just I donât think I handled it very well.

Joey: Well, what did you say to her?

Ross: Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.

Phoebe: Oh Ross.

Ross: But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.

Joey: (shocked) What?

Ross: I gotta go find her.

Joey: Whoa! Hey! Whoa!! Hold up! Are you serious?! So like 3% of the time they donât even work?! Huh? They should put that on the box!

Ross: Right! Right! I justâI want you to know that Iâm going to be there through this whole thing, okay? Okay? The doctorâs appointments, the uh, the Lamaze classes, uh baby-proofing the apartmentâAlthough we could probably worry about that âtil after we get married.

Rachel: What married?

Ross: Well yeah, I think we should get married.

Rachel: What, because thatâs your answer to everything?

Ross: No, because thatâs the right thing to do.

Rachel: Excuse me?

Ross: Come on Rach, you canât even eat alone in a restaurant.

Joey: I donât have a key, they took mine to give to you.

Phoebe: What?! They took mine to give to you!

Joey: Why would they take away our keys?

Phoebe: Maybe they donât trust us.

Joey: No thatâs not it. They let me keep my key the last time they were out of town.

Phoebe: You mean the time you broke the ketchup bottle and cleaned it up with Monicaâs guest towels?

Ross: Why? What-what else could it be?

Joey: Oh wow, I donât feel well.

Ross: Iâm telling you. Iâm telling you. Thatâs what it is. No wonder she was looking at me all funny during the wedding. She didnât say anything to you?

Joey: Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.

Ross: Yeah, I guess I should. (Starts to leave.) Man, yâknow what I have to realize? Maybe Iâm just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Yâknow, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. (He pauses and then exits.)

Ross: Okay. Okay. I mean Iâll be okay. Itâs just I donât think I handled it very well.

Ross: Nothing. But the complaint department at the condom company got an earful. And then when I turned around she was gone.

Phoebe: Oh Ross.

Ross: But hey, in my defense I-I just found out condoms are like only 97% effective.

Joey: Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.

Ross: Why? What-what else could it be?

Joey: Oh wow, I donât feel well.

Joey: Please, just-just, just go and talk to Rachel.

Ross: Yeah, I guess I should. (Starts to leave.) Man, yâknow what I have to realize? Maybe Iâm just not the type of guy women can have just one night with. Yâknow, they-they always seem to want a little bit more. I should remember that. (He pauses and then exits.)

Rachel: What married?

Ross: Well yeah, I think we should get married.

Rachel: What, because thatâs your answer to everything?

Ross: No, because thatâs the right thing to do.

Rachel: Yeah, maybe if youâre in love. But Ross, we are not in love, are we?

Ross: No butâ¦but still you canât possibly do this alone.

Rachel: Excuse me?

Ross: Come on Rach, you canât even eat alone in a restaurant.

Joey: Yâknow, if they knew what they were doing they probably didnât give you real names either.

Monica: Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they donât give out fake names.

Joey: Oh yeah? (To Phoebe) Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.

Chandler: (angrily) Was that another question?

Rachel: (entering) Hey! Is Ross still here?

Joey: Uh no Rach, heâs gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.

Rachel: Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? (Joey smiles luridly) Oh forget it! (Ross enters.) Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.

Ross: Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didnât even watch it! Anyway, here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (Tosses her the tape.)

Rachel: Thank you. (She sets it on the floor and is about to stomp on it with her shoe when the rest of the gang jumps up and yells simultaneously.) What? (They all yell again.) You donât want to see this do you?

Monica: Hell yeah!!!

Rachel: I am not gonna show you this!

Phoebe: No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.

Ross: Forget it, sheâs destroying it.

Phoebe: Okay fine! Fine! Weâll just have to think of some other way to put the whole âWho came onto who,â thing to rest! Come on now, think!!

Ross: Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? Itâs Rachelâs tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.

Rachel: I wanna see it.

Ross: What?!

Rachel: Clearly you donât want people to see this tape. Now I donât want people to see this tape either, but you so badly donât people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?

Joey: (confused) Are we watchinâ the tape or not?!

Ross: I donât want people to see it for your sake.

Rachel: Ahh, I donât believe you. I think you donât want them to see you begging me. (Goes to put the tape in the VCR)

Ross: Rachel, pleaseâ¦

Rachel: Ah, a little preview!

Ross: Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes Iâm gonna be sayingâ¦(He laughs and points at Rachel sarcastically.)

(They sit down on the couch, which is in front of the still recording camera.)

Chandler: Yeah, weâre gonna need to see that tape. (They rest of them agree.)

Monica: Yeah, definitely.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are now sitting in the living room.]

Monica: I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.

Joey: Yâknow, if they knew what they were doing they probably didnât give you real names either.

Monica: Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they donât give out fake names.

Joey: Oh yeah? (To Phoebe) Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.

Phoebe: Regina Philange. (Ken and Regina shake hands.)

Monica: (rolling her head from side to side) Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! (Joey and Phoebe laugh.)

Chandler: Well maybe it was all of your questions.

Monica: What about my questions?

Chandler: The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!

Monica: Oh, Iâm sorry. Was that another joke?

Chandler: (angrily) Was that another question?

Rachel: (entering) Hey! Is Ross still here?

Joey: Uh no Rach, heâs gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.

Rachel: Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? (Joey smiles luridly) Oh forget it! (Ross enters.) Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.

Ross: Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didnât even watch it! Anyway, here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (Tosses her the tape.)

Rachel: Thank you. (She sets it on the floor and is about to stomp on it with her shoe when the rest of the gang jumps up and yells simultaneously.) What? (They all yell again.) You donât want to see this do you?

Monica: Hell yeah!!!

Rachel: I am not gonna show you this!

Phoebe: No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.

Ross: Forget it, sheâs destroying it.

Phoebe: Okay fine! Fine! Weâll just have to think of some other way to put the whole âWho came onto who,â thing to rest! Come on now, think!!

Ross: Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? Itâs Rachelâs tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.

Rachel: I wanna see it.

Ross: What?!

Rachel: Clearly you donât want people to see this tape. Now I donât want people to see this tape either, but you so badly donât people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?

Joey: (confused) Are we watchinâ the tape or not?!

Ross: I donât want people to see it for your sake.

Ross: Rachel, pleaseâ¦

Rachel: Ah, a little preview!

Ross: Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes Iâm gonna be sayingâ¦(He laughs and points at Rachel sarcastically.)

Joey: Uh no Rach, heâs gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.

Rachel: Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? (Joey smiles luridly) Oh forget it! (Ross enters.) Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.

Ross: Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didnât even watch it! Anyway, here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (Tosses her the tape.)

Rachel: Thank you. (She sets it on the floor and is about to stomp on it with her shoe when the rest of the gang jumps up and yells simultaneously.) What? (They all yell again.) You donât want to see this do you?

Rachel: I am not gonna show you this!

Phoebe: No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.

Ross: Forget it, sheâs destroying it.

Phoebe: Okay fine! Fine! Weâll just have to think of some other way to put the whole âWho came onto who,â thing to rest! Come on now, think!!

Ross: Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? Itâs Rachelâs tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.

Rachel: I wanna see it.

Ross: What?!

Rachel: Clearly you donât want people to see this tape. Now I donât want people to see this tape either, but you so badly donât people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?

Ross: (glaring at him) Yeah, thanks. (Joey nods no problem.)

Rachel: And so I had a lot of work to do so Ross, nice guy that he is, offered to help me out. And then we had a little wine, we got to talking, and the next thing you know out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.

Rachel: That-that you came on to me?

Ross: Thereâs the one!

Rachel: But you did! I mean, letâs be honest.

Ross: Yes letâs. Yâknow what? Uh, itâs-itâs not important. What is important is that, is that weâre having a baby. And itâs notâDoesnât matter who came on to who.

Joey: Whom. (Everyone looks at him shocked.) Thatâs right.

Rachel: You know you kissed me first.

Ross: What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!

Rachel: I was sending you signals?

Rachel: Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands. (Ross raises his hand and no one else.)

Ross: Yâknow what?! It doesnât matter! It doesnât matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!

Rachel: Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, âcause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?

Ross: Yâknow what? Yâknow what? Rachel, just-just drop it.

Rachel: No please, show me how I begged you!

Ross: I can show you, I have it on videotape! (Stunned silence) Itâs an expression.

Monica: What?! People donât do that!

Joey: Oh I think we do.

Monica: They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?

Chandler: I donât know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.

Monica: And youâve never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!

Joey: Yâknow what? Donât worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe.

Phoebe: Excuse me, I donât want Greg and Jennyâs rejects.

Ross: (entering) Rachel wonât talk to me! She wonât even open the door!

Phoebe: Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!

Ross: Okay, listen I am not a pervert!

Phoebe: Thatâs like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!

Ross: Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, hereâs what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing.

Joey: Personal thing? What personal thing? I donât know.

Ross: Aboutâ¦about sex? (Joey looks at him confused) That I hadnât had sex in months?

Joey: Whoa, for like months?

Ross: Five to be lying, six.

Joey: Six months? Whoa thatâs rough.

Joey: The skyâs blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!

Ross: Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okayâIâm scared for my health!

Joey: Okay. Okay. Ummâ¦Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. Itâs this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; theyâre like putty.

Ross: Really? Well then tell it to me.

Joey: Okay. Now youâre gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.

And there were tall trees all around. (Whispering) It was dead silent. Gorgeous. (Softly) And across the lake I sawâ¦a beautiful womanâ¦bathing herselfâ¦but she was cryingâ¦

Joey: Well youâre not selling the story! Itâs like; itâs like you donât believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when Iâm preparing for an audition. Okay? Iâll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what youâre doing wrong.

Rachel: Oh Ross!

Ross: Hi!

Rachel: Thank God youâre here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?

Ross: Thatâs less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.

(They sit down on the couch, which is in front of the still recording camera.)

Ross: (voiceover) So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything.

(Pause)

Chandler: Yeah, weâre gonna need to see that tape. (They rest of them agree.)

Monica: Yeah, definitely.

Ross: What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!

Joey: Yâknow what? This is not fair to her. Letâs just forget the tape!

Ross: Thank you. (Joey mouths to Ross, "Youâll show me right?") No!

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are now sitting in the living room.]

Monica: I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.

Joey: Yâknow, if they knew what they were doing they probably didnât give you real names either.

Monica: Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they donât give out fake names.

Joey: Oh yeah? (To Phoebe) Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.

Phoebe: Regina Philange. (Ken and Regina shake hands.)

Chandler: I still donât get it, we didnât do anything wrong.

Monica: I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.

Chandler: I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!

Monica: (rolling her head from side to side) Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! (Joey and Phoebe laugh.)

Chandler: Well maybe it was all of your questions.

Monica: What about my questions?

Chandler: The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!

Monica: Oh, Iâm sorry. Was that another joke?

Chandler: (angrily) Was that another question?

Rachel: (entering) Hey! Is Ross still here?

Joey: Uh no Rach, heâs gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.

Rachel: Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? (Joey smiles luridly) Oh forget it! (Ross enters.) Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.

Ross: Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didnât even watch it! Anyway, here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (Tosses her the tape.)

Rachel: Thank you. (She sets it on the floor and is about to stomp on it with her shoe when the rest of the gang jumps up and yells simultaneously.) What? (They all yell again.) You donât want to see this do you?

Monica: Hell yeah!!!

Rachel: I am not gonna show you this!

Phoebe: No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.

Ross: Forget it, sheâs destroying it.

Phoebe: Okay fine! Fine! Weâll just have to think of some other way to put the whole âWho came onto who,â thing to rest! Come on now, think!!

Ross: Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? Itâs Rachelâs tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.

Rachel: I wanna see it.

Ross: What?!

Rachel: Clearly you donât want people to see this tape. Now I donât want people to see this tape either, but you so badly donât people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?

Joey: (confused) Are we watchinâ the tape or not?!

Ross: I donât want people to see it for your sake.

Rachel: Ahh, I donât believe you. I think you donât want them to see you begging me. (Goes to put the tape in the VCR)

Ross: Rachel, pleaseâ¦

Rachel: Ah, a little preview!

Ross: Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes Iâm gonna be sayingâ¦(He laughs and points at Rachel sarcastically.)

Rachel: But you did! I mean, letâs be honest.

Ross: Yes letâs. Yâknow what? Uh, itâs-itâs not important. What is important is that, is that weâre having a baby. And itâs notâDoesnât matter who came on to who.

Joey: Whom. (Everyone looks at him shocked.) Thatâs right.

Rachel: You know you kissed me first.

Ross: What? What?! You were begging me to kiss you! You-you-you were sending me signals all over the place!

Rachel: I was sending you signals?

Ross: Yeah!

Rachel: Oh please. Okay, anyone in this room think that I would send Ross begging symbols, please show of hands. (Ross raises his hand and no one else.)

Ross: Yâknow what?! It doesnât matter! It doesnât matter what you believe! What matters is what happened!

Rachel: Okay. So these signals Ross, explain this to me, âcause maybe I need to be more careful. I mean, am I sending you these signals right now?

Ross: Yâknow what? Yâknow what? Rachel, just-just drop it.

Rachel: No please, show me how I begged you!

Ross: I can show you, I have it on videotape! (Stunned silence) Itâs an expression.

Chandler: What?

Phoebe: You got fake numbered.

Monica: What?! People donât do that!

Joey: Oh I think we do.

Monica: They gave us a fake number? Why? Why would they do that?

Chandler: I donât know! You were a delight to talk to. You asked all those insightful, great questions.

Monica: And youâve never been funnier. Joke, joke, joke, you were a hoot!

Joey: Yâknow what? Donât worry about it, you still got me and Phoebe.

Phoebe: Excuse me, I donât want Greg and Jennyâs rejects.

Ross: (entering) Rachel wonât talk to me! She wonât even open the door!

Phoebe: Hmm, I wonder why. Pervert!

Ross: Okay, listen I am not a pervert!

Phoebe: Thatâs like the pervert motto! Yeah! Yeah! They have you raise your right hand, put your left hand down your pants, and repeat that!

Ross: Filming Rachel is not something I planned. Okay look, hereâs what happened, and Joey you-you can back me up on this. All right, about-about a month and a half ago I came to you with a problem? Umm, a personal thing.

Joey: Personal thing? What personal thing? I donât know.

Ross: Aboutâ¦about sex? (Joey looks at him confused) That I hadnât had sex in months?

Joey: Whoa, for like months?

Ross: Five to be lying, six.

Joey: Six months? Whoa thatâs rough.

Ross: Well, I mean itâs not all bad. Iâm learning to appreciate the uh, smaller things in life. Like the sound of a bird and the color of the sky.

Joey: The skyâs blue Ross and I had sex yesterday!

Ross: Please, help me! I have a date tonight. It has to go well okayâIâm scared for my health!

Joey: Okay. Okay. Ummâ¦Ooh! Oh-oh, I got something. Itâs this story I came up with, very romantic. I swear any woman that hears it; theyâre like putty.

Ross: Really? Well then tell it to me.

Joey: Okay. Now youâre gonna want to have sex with me when you hear it, but you have to remember it is just the story.

Ross: (sarcastic) Iâll try to control myself.

Joey: Okay. (Clears throat) Years ago, when I was backpacking across Western Europeâ¦

Joey: Have a nice six more months Ross! (Starts to leave.)

Ross: (stopping him) Okay! Okay! Okay. Iâm sorry. Please, please, you were in Western Europe and?

And there were tall trees all around. (Whispering) It was dead silent. Gorgeous. (Softly) And across the lake I sawâ¦a beautiful womanâ¦bathing herselfâ¦but she was cryingâ¦

Ross: Great! Iâm across the street having sex with her right now. Your story sucks!

Joey: Hey! Look, if it didnât work itâs because you didnât tell it right! Show me how you did it.

Ross: No! No, I donâtâ¦donât want to.

Joey: How long since youâve seen a girl naked?

Ross: I was just outside Barcelona, hikingâ¦

Joey: No! No! No Ross! Iâm not hot! Are you hot?

Ross: Itâs been six months! Iâm always hot!

Joey: Well youâre not selling the story! Itâs like; itâs like you donât believe it! Look, I gotta go. I got a date, but try this. Do what I do when Iâm preparing for an audition. Okay? Iâll set you up with my video camera and you can record yourself and-and see what youâre doing wrong.

Ross: Iâll try that.

Joey: All right nowâ¦ All right, youâre all set up. Youâre good to go. Just hit record. All right?

Ross: Thanks.

Joey: Good luck.

Ross: Thanks. And-and hey Joe?

Joey: Yeah?

Joey: (trying not to laugh) That means a lot to me man. (Exits.)

(Ross pours himself a glass of wine, hits record, and sits down in front of the camera.)

Ross: Hello! Can I get you anything? Huh? Lens cleaner? Your battery okay? (Rachel bursts in carrying two boxes and Ross jumps up.) Rachel!

Rachel: Oh Ross!

Ross: Hi!

Rachel: Thank God youâre here! You have to help me! Were you just talking to yourself?

Ross: Thatâs less embarrassing, yes. Yes I was.

(They sit down on the couch, which is in front of the still recording camera.)

Ross: (voiceover) So when she came in, I got distracted and totally forgot about the camera. [Cut back to the present day.] It kept rolling and recorded everything.

(Pause)

Chandler: Yeah, weâre gonna need to see that tape. (They rest of them agree.)

Monica: Yeah, definitely.

Ross: What a great idea! That will get Rachel to forgive me!

Joey: Yâknow what? This is not fair to her. Letâs just forget the tape!

Ross: Thank you. (Joey mouths to Ross, "Youâll show me right?") No!

Joey: Youâre right. (Mouths, "I know youâll show me, right?)

Ross: Joey! No!

(Ross storms out.)

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's, Monica, Chandler, Joey, and Phoebe are now sitting in the living room.]

Monica: I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.

Joey: Yâknow, if they knew what they were doing they probably didnât give you real names either.

Monica: Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they donât give out fake names.

Joey: Oh yeah? (To Phoebe) Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you.

Phoebe: Regina Philange. (Ken and Regina shake hands.)

Chandler: I still donât get it, we didnât do anything wrong.

Monica: I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes.

Chandler: I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!

Monica: (rolling her head from side to side) Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah! (Joey and Phoebe laugh.)

Chandler: Well maybe it was all of your questions.

Monica: What about my questions?

Chandler: The sheer volume, it was like flying with the Riddler!

Monica: Oh, Iâm sorry. Was that another joke?

Chandler: (angrily) Was that another question?

Rachel: (entering) Hey! Is Ross still here?

Joey: Uh no Rach, heâs gone. But listen, he told us what happened and it does, it sounds like an honest mistake.

Rachel: Oh really? Well how would you like it if I had sex with you and I taped it? (Joey smiles luridly) Oh forget it! (Ross enters.) Oh there he is now, the father of my child, the porn king of the west village.

Ross: Look, it was accident! Okay? I-I feel bad that it happened, but I swear, I didnât even watch it! Anyway, here. (He takes the tape out of his coat pocket.) I thought you might be more comfortable destroying it yourself. (Tosses her the tape.)

Rachel: Thank you. (She sets it on the floor and is about to stomp on it with her shoe when the rest of the gang jumps up and yells simultaneously.) What? (They all yell again.) You donât want to see this do you?

Monica: Hell yeah!!!

Rachel: I am not gonna show you this!

Phoebe: No! Not the sex part, just the stuff leading up to it.

Ross: Forget it, sheâs destroying it.

Phoebe: Okay fine! Fine! Weâll just have to think of some other way to put the whole âWho came onto who,â thing to rest! Come on now, think!!

Ross: Look, forget it Phoebe. Okay? Itâs Rachelâs tape and she can do whatever she wants with it. And she wants to destroy it. So, end of story.

Rachel: I wanna see it.

Ross: What?!

Rachel: Clearly you donât want people to see this tape. Now I donât want people to see this tape either, but you so badly donât people to see it makes me want to see it. You see?

Joey: (confused) Are we watchinâ the tape or not?!

Ross: I donât want people to see it for your sake.

Rachel: Ahh, I donât believe you. I think you donât want them to see you begging me. (Goes to put the tape in the VCR)

Ross: Rachel, pleaseâ¦

Rachel: Ah, a little preview!

Ross: Fine. Fine, but I want the record to show that I tried to take the high road, because in about five minutes Iâm gonna be sayingâ¦(He laughs and points at Rachel sarcastically.)

(They both sit down.)

Rachel: Okay, here we go. (Pushes play.)

Rachel: (on tape) (Ross hands her a glass of wine) I cannot believe that I did this. Especially after Monica just went on and on and on about it! (Mimicking Monica) "Okay Rachel! Here are the invitations Rachel! Now be very careful Rachel! Please, drinking no liquids around the invitations Rachel!" (She tilts her wine glass above and moves it back and forth across the invitations) Whoa oh! Oh-oh-oh! Ohâ¦oh-oh-ohâ¦
