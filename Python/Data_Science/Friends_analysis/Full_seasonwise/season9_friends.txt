Ross: Uh Joey, can you give us just a minute?

Joey: No.

Ross: What?

Joey: Oh, Iâm sorry. I meant no.

Phoebe: (taking Ross aside) Have umm, have you thought anymore about you and Rachel?

Ross: Oh well yeah, actually I was going to talk to her when you guys all came in the room.

Phoebe: Yay! Itâs so exciting! Wow, you couldâve done that with us there.

Ross: Yeah right.

Phoebe: Oh sure okay, you can touch yourself in front of us but you canât talk to Rachel.

Ross: What?! When have I ever touched myself in front of you guys?

Phoebe: Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.

Joey: (taking Chandler aside) Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?

Chandler: Sure.

Joey: Dude I just did something terrible.

Chandler: That was you?! I thought it was Jack!

Joey: No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!

Chandler: What?! Why does she think that?

Joey: Because it kinda looked like I did.

Chandler: Again, what?!

Joey: Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my handâ¦

Chandler: As we all are at some point during the day.

Joey: It wasnât my ring! It fell out of Rossâs jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!

Chandler: Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?

Joey: I guess.

Chandler: And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!

Joey: I know! I know itâs awful.

Chandler: Well, what did she say?

Joey: (happily) She said yes.

Chandler: Does Ross know?

Joey: Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?

Chandler: Well maybe you donât have to tell him anything.

Joey: Oh, I like that. Yeahâ¦

Chandler: If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!

Joey: (laughs) Now letâs not get carried away. (He walks away as Monica comes over and hugs Chandler from behind.)

Monica: I want a baby.

Chandler: Honey, weâve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.

Monica: Come on! Come on, if we have sex again itâll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closetâs still available?

Chandler: Iâm so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah okay, but no foreplay.

Monica: Deal!

[Back in front of the nursery window.]

Ross: Dad seriously! Yâknow you really should see someone about that!

Mr. Geller: Noted.

Ross: I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?

Rachel: Uhhâ¦ I think I just got engaged.

Phoebe: Oh my God! He did it?

Rachel: Wellâ¦did you know he was gonna ask me?

Phoebe: Are you kidding? Iâm like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.

Rachel: And you really think this is a good idea?

Phoebe: I just talked him into it, donât tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.

Rachel: I just donât know! It just doesnât feel right.

Phoebe: Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.

Rachel: Really?! Even Ross?

Phoebe: Especially Ross!

Joey: (entering) Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh yâknow what? Iâll-Iâll come back later. (He goes to leave but runs into Ross whoâs entering.)

Ross: Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. Iâll guess justâ¦Iâll come back. (Ross exits followed by Joey.)

Phoebe: There he goes, your fiancï¿½e.

Rachel: I guess so.

Phoebe: Although he does play with himself in his sleep.

Rachel: I canât say that Iâm surprised.

[Scene: A hallway, Joey and Ross find Mr. Geller with his ear up against a janitorâs closet door.]

Ross: Dad, what are you doing?

Mr. Geller: I think there are people in there having sex.

(Ross turns to look at Joey.)

Joey: It canât be me, Iâm standing right here.

Mr. Geller: Wanna peek?

Ross: No!

Mr. Geller: Come on!

Ross: Yâknow what? I donât like you without mom. (To Joey) Come on. (Walks away.)

Joey: (To Ross) Weâre not peeking? (Follows him.)

Mr. Geller: Well Iâm peeking. (He peeks.) Oh my God!

Chandler: Hello sir, you know Monica.

[Scene: Rachelâs Room, she is taking the ring out of Rossâs jacket, looks at it, and puts it on her finger as Joey enters.]

Rachel: Hey!

Nurse: Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?

Rachel: Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she wonât take my breast?

Nurse: Itâs all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but donât worry. Itâll happen.

Joey: (watching) Yowsa! (Looks away.)

Rachel: Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.

Joey: Dear Lord.

Rachel: Iâm sorry honey, what were you saying?

Joey: Oh uh-uh yeah, I think thatâ¦

Rachel: Oh look, sheâs pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? (Joey gets embarrassed.) She looks scared. Doesnât she look scared?

Joey: Yâknow, I donât really know her.

Nurse: Why donât we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow. (Does so.)

Joey: (To God) Are you kidding me?!

Rachel: Itâs just so frustrating! Why doesnât she want my breast?!

Joey: I donât know! Maybe sheâs crazy! (Storms out.)

[Scene: The Lobby, Ross is eating a sandwich as Phoebe rushes up to him.]

Phoebe: Oh hey! Wait up!

Ross: Hi!

Phoebe: Congratulations! I didnât want to say anything in front of Joey âcause I didnât know if he knew yet.

Ross: What, that we had a baby? Come on letâs give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.

Phoebe: No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!

Ross: What?

Phoebe: Oh, itâs a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We havenât done the secret thing in a long time.

Ross: Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didnât propose.

Phoebe: Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?

Ross: (pause) I am a doctor! Yâknow what? Iâm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.

Phoebe: All right, me too. (They go into her room and see that sheâs sleeping.) Should we wake her up?

Ross: No! No, come on let her sleep! Sheâs so exhausted.

Phoebe: And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.)

Ross: What? (Motions for Phoebe to go outside with him.) Oh my God! She-she thinks weâre engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think weâre engaged?!

Phoebe: Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Yâknow Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.

Ross: I didnât give her that ring!

Phoebe: Really?

Ross: No!

Phoebe: So whose ring is it?

Ross: Itâs mine.

Phoebe: Is it an engagement ring?

Ross: Yes!

Phoebe: But you didnât give it to her?

Ross: No!

Phoebe: But you were going to propose?

Ross: No!!

Phoebe: Huh, I might be losing interest in this.

Ross: Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybeâ¦kindaâ¦wanted ahâ¦startâ¦things up again.

Phoebe: Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.

Ross: Look, I didnât want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didnât want to either. But I donât, I donât understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?

Phoebe: No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.

Ross: Well I didnât! I didnât propose! (Pause) Unless uhâ¦ (Pause) Did I? I havenât slept in forty hours andâ¦it does sound like something I would do.

Commercial Break

[Scene: The Janitorâs Closet, Chandler and Monica are trying to figure out what to do now.]

Chandler: Look, we canât stay in here forever.

Monica: Oh, I still canât believe my dad saw us having sex! He didnât make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!

Chandler: This is okay. Weâre all adults here; thereâs nothing to be ashamed of. Now, letâs put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (They do so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)

Monica: Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?

Mr. Geller: Of course. Iâll always be your dad.

Chandler: I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasnât for fun.

Monica: It wasnât fun?!

Chandler: (To Monica) Why? Why-why-would youâWh-whyâ¦ (To Mr. Geller) Look, I just donât want you to think that weâre animals who do it whenever we want.

Mr. Geller: Oh, I donât think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time.

Monica: The truth is, Dad, weâre-weâre trying.

Mr. Geller: What?

Monica: Yeah, weâre trying to get pregnant.

Mr. Geller: Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there! (Points to the closet) Iâll guard the door!

Monica: Well, thatâs okay dad, we-we can wait until later.

Mr. Geller: Whoa-whoa-whoa! I donât think so! Arenât you ovulating?

Monica: Daddy?!

Mr. Geller: Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. Thatâs how I got my bad hip.

Chandler: Thatâs funny, this conversationâs how I got the bullet hole in my head.

Mr. Geller: This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she wasâ¦

Monica: Daddy! I donât think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.

Mr. Geller: Youâre right, youâre right. This is about your positions. Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good.

Monica: I donât feel good right now.

Mr. Geller: But pleasure is important, (To Chandler) and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?

Chandler: Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.

[Scene: Rachelâs Room, Monica is entering.]

Monica: What?

Rachel: Joey proposed to me.

Monica: Is he crazy?! You just had Rossâs baby!

Rachel: Well, I-I said yes.

Monica: What?! Are you crazy? You just had Rossâs baby! Itâs-itâs so inappropriate. No, itâs worse than that. Itâs wrong. Itâsâ¦ It is bigger than mine! (Rachelâs engagement ring.)

Rachel: I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.

Monica: You canât marry him!

Rachel: Why not? I donât want to do this alone! And heâs such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.

Monica: Well do you love him?

Rachel: Sure.

Monica: Sure?

Rachel: Yeah, I mean whatever.

Monica: Honey, the question isâ¦do you really want to marry Joey?

Rachel: No. No, I donât. Could you be a dear and go tell him?

[Scene: A Hallway, Chandler is following Joey.]

Chandler: You still havenât told Rachel you werenât really proposing?

Joey: No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.

Chandler: Joey, you have to tell her whatâs going on! And what did it look like?!

Joey: I didnât look at it. Stupid babyâs head was blocking most of it.

Chandler: Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.

Joey: Look, itâs not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I donât want to hurt her.

Chandler: Okay, look, just do it gently.

Joey: Youâre right. Youâre right. I-Iâll go tell her now before Ross finds out and Iâll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there (Points to the closet Chandler and Monica were in) if you want to check that out.

Rachel: I know.

Ross: I donât think you do.

Rachel: You didnât propose to me. Joey did.

Rachel: Well then why did you give me a ring?

Ross: Wait! Whoa-whoa, youâ¦you gave her the ring?

Joey: No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!

Joey: Ahhh!

Rachel: He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.

Ross: Whoa! You were down on one knee?

Joey: Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didnâtâ¦I didnât propose!

Ross: Then what did happen?

Rachel: Yeah, what did happen?

Joey: Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.

Rachel: Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?"

Joey: No, I didnât!

Rachel: Yes, you did!

Joey: No, I didnât!

Rachel: Yes, you didâOh my God you didnât! (Screams) Well then why didnât you tell me that before?!

Joey: Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!

Ross: Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!

Joey: (To Ross) Iâll tell you about it later. Be cool.

Rachel: Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!

Joey: It wasnât my ring! Itâs Rossâs ring! Thatâs why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.

Ross: What?!

Rachel: You were gonna propose to me?

Ross: Uhhâ¦ No.

Phoebe: Oh please! Just before when you were asleep in the lounge! That Armenian family was watching you instead of the TV. Oh, that reminds me. That Mr. Hasmeje still has my Gameboy.

Joey: (taking Chandler aside) Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?

Chandler: Sure.

Joey: Dude I just did something terrible.

Chandler: That was you?! I thought it was Jack!

Joey: No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!

Chandler: What?! Why does she think that?

Joey: Because it kinda looked like I did.

Chandler: Again, what?!

Joey: Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my handâ¦

Chandler: As we all are at some point during the day.

Joey: It wasnât my ring! It fell out of Rossâs jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!

Chandler: Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?

Joey: I guess.

Chandler: And you did it first?! This is gonna kill him! You know how much he loves to propose!

Joey: I know! I know itâs awful.

Chandler: Well, what did she say?

Joey: (happily) She said yes.

Chandler: Does Ross know?

Joey: Oh God, what the hell am I going to tell him?

Chandler: Well maybe you donât have to tell him anything.

Joey: Oh, I like that. Yeahâ¦

Chandler: If you clear things up with Rachel then Ross never needs to find out, but you have to do it now before he hears about it and kicks your ass!

Joey: (laughs) Now letâs not get carried away. (He walks away as Monica comes over and hugs Chandler from behind.)

Monica: I want a baby.

Chandler: Honey, weâve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.

Monica: Come on! Come on, if we have sex again itâll double our chances of getting pregnant. Do you think that closetâs still available?

Chandler: Iâm so tired. (She starts kissing him.) Yeah okay, but no foreplay.

Monica: Deal!

[Back in front of the nursery window.]

Ross: Dad seriously! Yâknow you really should see someone about that!

Mr. Geller: Noted.

Ross: I wanna go talk to Rachel for a minute, are you gonna be okay alone for a bit?

Mr. Geller: Are you kidding me, I could stay and look at her forever.

Ross: (noticing something) Actually ummâ¦ (He turns Mr. Gellerâs head to look at Emma.)

[Scene: Rachelâs Room, Phoebe is entering.]

Phoebe: Hey!

Rachel: Hi.

Phoebe: Are you all right?

Rachel: Uhhâ¦ I think I just got engaged.

Phoebe: Oh my God! He did it?

Rachel: Wellâ¦did you know he was gonna ask me?

Phoebe: Are you kidding? Iâm like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.

Rachel: And you really think this is a good idea?

Phoebe: I just talked him into it, donât tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.

Rachel: I just donât know! It just doesnât feel right.

Phoebe: Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.

Rachel: Really?! Even Ross?

Phoebe: Especially Ross!

Joey: (entering) Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh yâknow what? Iâll-Iâll come back later. (He goes to leave but runs into Ross whoâs entering.)

Ross: Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. Iâll guess justâ¦Iâll come back. (Ross exits followed by Joey.)

Phoebe: There he goes, your fiancï¿½e.

Rachel: I guess so.

Phoebe: Although he does play with himself in his sleep.

Rachel: I canât say that Iâm surprised.

[Scene: A hallway, Joey and Ross find Mr. Geller with his ear up against a janitorâs closet door.]

Ross: Dad, what are you doing?

Mr. Geller: I think there are people in there having sex.

(Ross turns to look at Joey.)

Joey: It canât be me, Iâm standing right here.

Mr. Geller: Wanna peek?

Ross: No!

Mr. Geller: Come on!

Ross: Yâknow what? I donât like you without mom. (To Joey) Come on. (Walks away.)

Joey: (To Ross) Weâre not peeking? (Follows him.)

Mr. Geller: Well Iâm peeking. (He peeks.) Oh my God!

Chandler: Hello sir, you know Monica.

[Scene: Rachelâs Room, she is taking the ring out of Rossâs jacket, looks at it, and puts it on her finger as Joey enters.]

Joey: Hey uh, is it okay to come in?

Rachel: Of course! Oh Joey, this ring Iâ¦itâs beautiful I love it!

Joey: Yeah uh look Rach, thereâs something I gotta tell ya.

(Thereâs a knock on the door and a nurse enters carrying Emma.)

Rachel: Hey!

Nurse: Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?

Rachel: Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she wonât take my breast?

Nurse: Itâs all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but donât worry. Itâll happen.

Joey: (watching) Yowsa! (Looks away.)

Rachel: Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.

Joey: Dear Lord.

Rachel: Iâm sorry honey, what were you saying?

Joey: Oh uh-uh yeah, I think thatâ¦

Rachel: Oh look, sheâs pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? (Joey gets embarrassed.) She looks scared. Doesnât she look scared?

Joey: Yâknow, I donât really know her.

Nurse: Why donât we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow. (Does so.)

Joey: (To God) Are you kidding me?!

Rachel: Itâs just so frustrating! Why doesnât she want my breast?!

Joey: I donât know! Maybe sheâs crazy! (Storms out.)

[Scene: The Lobby, Ross is eating a sandwich as Phoebe rushes up to him.]

Phoebe: Oh hey! Wait up!

Ross: Hi!

Phoebe: Congratulations! I didnât want to say anything in front of Joey âcause I didnât know if he knew yet.

Ross: What, that we had a baby? Come on letâs give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.

Phoebe: No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!

Ross: What?

Phoebe: Oh, itâs a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We havenât done the secret thing in a long time.

Ross: Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didnât propose.

Phoebe: Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?

Ross: (pause) I am a doctor! Yâknow what? Iâm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.

Phoebe: All right, me too. (They go into her room and see that sheâs sleeping.) Should we wake her up?

Ross: No! No, come on let her sleep! Sheâs so exhausted.

Phoebe: And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.)

Ross: What? (Motions for Phoebe to go outside with him.) Oh my God! She-she thinks weâre engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think weâre engaged?!

Phoebe: Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Yâknow Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.

Ross: I didnât give her that ring!

Phoebe: Really?

Ross: No!

Phoebe: So whose ring is it?

Ross: Itâs mine.

Phoebe: Is it an engagement ring?

Ross: Yes!

Phoebe: But you didnât give it to her?

Ross: No!

Phoebe: But you were going to propose?

Ross: No!!

Phoebe: Huh, I might be losing interest in this.

Ross: Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybeâ¦kindaâ¦wanted ahâ¦startâ¦things up again.

Phoebe: Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.

Ross: Look, I didnât want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didnât want to either. But I donât, I donât understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?

Phoebe: No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.

Ross: Well I didnât! I didnât propose! (Pause) Unless uhâ¦ (Pause) Did I? I havenât slept in forty hours andâ¦it does sound like something I would do.

Commercial Break

[Scene: The Janitorâs Closet, Chandler and Monica are trying to figure out what to do now.]

Chandler: Look, we canât stay in here forever.

Monica: Oh, I still canât believe my dad saw us having sex! He didnât make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!

Chandler: This is okay. Weâre all adults here; thereâs nothing to be ashamed of. Now, letâs put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (They do so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)

Monica: Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?

Mr. Geller: Of course. Iâll always be your dad.

Chandler: I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasnât for fun.

Monica: It wasnât fun?!

Chandler: (To Monica) Why? Why-why-would youâWh-whyâ¦ (To Mr. Geller) Look, I just donât want you to think that weâre animals who do it whenever we want.

Mr. Geller: Oh, I donât think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time.

Monica: The truth is, Dad, weâre-weâre trying.

Mr. Geller: What?

Monica: Yeah, weâre trying to get pregnant.

Mr. Geller: Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there! (Points to the closet) Iâll guard the door!

Monica: Well, thatâs okay dad, we-we can wait until later.

Mr. Geller: Whoa-whoa-whoa! I donât think so! Arenât you ovulating?

Monica: Daddy?!

Mr. Geller: Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. Thatâs how I got my bad hip.

Chandler: Thatâs funny, this conversationâs how I got the bullet hole in my head.

Mr. Geller: This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she wasâ¦

Monica: Daddy! I donât think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.

Mr. Geller: Youâre right, youâre right. This is about your positions. Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good.

Monica: I donât feel good right now.

Mr. Geller: But pleasure is important, (To Chandler) and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?

Chandler: Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.

[Scene: Rachelâs Room, Monica is entering.]

Monica: Hey.

Rachel: Hey. I need to tell you something.

Monica: Well, nowâs a good time. Iâm on my way to have my ears cut off.

Rachel: Joey asked me marry him.

Monica: What?

Rachel: Joey proposed to me.

Monica: Is he crazy?! You just had Rossâs baby!

Rachel: Well, I-I said yes.

Monica: What?! Are you crazy? You just had Rossâs baby! Itâs-itâs so inappropriate. No, itâs worse than that. Itâs wrong. Itâsâ¦ It is bigger than mine! (Rachelâs engagement ring.)

Rachel: I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.

Monica: You canât marry him!

Rachel: Why not? I donât want to do this alone! And heâs such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.

Monica: Well do you love him?

Rachel: Sure.

Monica: Sure?

Rachel: Yeah, I mean whatever.

Monica: Honey, the question isâ¦do you really want to marry Joey?

Rachel: No. No, I donât. Could you be a dear and go tell him?

[Scene: A Hallway, Chandler is following Joey.]

Chandler: You still havenât told Rachel you werenât really proposing?

Joey: No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.

Chandler: Joey, you have to tell her whatâs going on! And what did it look like?!

Joey: I didnât look at it. Stupid babyâs head was blocking most of it.

Chandler: Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.

Joey: Look, itâs not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I donât want to hurt her.

Chandler: Okay, look, just do it gently.

Joey: Youâre right. Youâre right. I-Iâll go tell her now before Ross finds out and Iâll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there (Points to the closet Chandler and Monica were in) if you want to check that out.

Ross: And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I umâ¦I didnât propose to you.

Rachel: I know.

Ross: I donât think you do.

Rachel: You didnât propose to me. Joey did.

Ross: Poor baby, youâre so tired. Rach, I didnât propose to you, Joey didnât propose to you, and Chandler didnât propose to you.

Rachel: Uhâ¦ You didnât propose to me, Chandler didnât propose to me, but Joey did.

(Joey enters.)

Ross: Joey proposed to you?

Joey: I can come back.

Ross: Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?

Joey: No.

Rachel: Yes you did!

Joey: Actually, technically, I didnât.

Rachel: Well then why did you give me a ring?

Ross: Wait! Whoa-whoa, youâ¦you gave her the ring?

Joey: No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!

Rachel: Yes, you did!

Joey: No, I didnât!

Rachel: Yes, you did!

Joey: No, I didnât!

Rachel: Yes, you did! And donât you say, "No, I didnât!"

Joey: Ahhh!

Rachel: He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.

Ross: Whoa! You were down on one knee?

Joey: Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didnâtâ¦I didnât propose!

Ross: Then what did happen?

Rachel: Yeah, what did happen?

Joey: Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.

Rachel: Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?"

Joey: No, I didnât!

Rachel: Yes, you did!

Joey: No, I didnât!

Rachel: Yes, you didâOh my God you didnât! (Screams) Well then why didnât you tell me that before?!

Joey: Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!

Ross: Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!

Joey: (To Ross) Iâll tell you about it later. Be cool.

Rachel: Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!

Joey: It wasnât my ring! Itâs Rossâs ring! Thatâs why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.

Ross: What?!

Rachel: You were gonna propose to me?

Ross: Uhhâ¦ No.

(An awkward silence follows.)

Joey: Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}

Ross: But I-I was going to see if yâknow, maybe you uh, start dating again but thatâI mean that-that was all, Rach.

Joey: Dude, step up! I proposed.

Ross: No, you didnât!

Joey: Oh thatâs right. Thereâs a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.

(Thereâs a knock on the door and the Nurse enters carrying Emma.)

Nurse: Hey, she just woke up! Sheâs hungry. Why donât we give this another try?

Rachel: Okay.

Ross: (To Joey) I canât believe you told her I was going to propose!

Joey: I canât believe youâre not going to propose!

Ross: Hey, Iâm not going to rush into anything!

Joey: Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!

Rachel: Oh my God!

Ross: What?

Rachel: Sheâs doing it Look, sheâs breast-feeding look!

Joey: (taking Chandler aside) Hey Chandler, can I talk to you for a second?

Chandler: Sure.

Joey: Dude I just did something terrible.

Chandler: That was you?! I thought it was Jack!

Joey: No! No, that was Jack! Rachel thinks I asked her to marry me!

Joey: Because it kinda looked like I did.

Chandler: Again, what?!

Joey: Okay well, I was down on one knee with the ring in my handâ¦

Chandler: As we all are at some point during the day.

Joey: It wasnât my ring! It fell out of Rossâs jacket! And when I knelt down to pick it up Rachel thought I was proposing!

Chandler: Ross had a ring?! And he was gonna propose?

Joey: (laughs) Now letâs not get carried away. (He walks away as Monica comes over and hugs Chandler from behind.)

Monica: I want a baby.

Chandler: Honey, weâve been over this. I need to be facing the other way.

Phoebe: Oh my God! He did it?

Rachel: Wellâ¦did you know he was gonna ask me?

Phoebe: Are you kidding? Iâm like the one who talked him into it. I like to think of myself as the puppet master of the group.

Rachel: And you really think this is a good idea?

Phoebe: I just talked him into it, donât tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.

Rachel: I just donât know! It just doesnât feel right.

Phoebe: Why?! You two are so meant to be together, everybody thinks so.

Rachel: Really?! Even Ross?

Phoebe: Especially Ross!

Joey: (entering) Oh uh, hey Pheebs. Uh yâknow what? Iâll-Iâll come back later. (He goes to leave but runs into Ross whoâs entering.)

Ross: Wow! Kind of uh, kind of a full house here. Iâll guess justâ¦Iâll come back. (Ross exits followed by Joey.)

Phoebe: There he goes, your fiancï¿½e.

Rachel: I guess so.

Phoebe: Although he does play with himself in his sleep.

Rachel: I canât say that Iâm surprised.

[Scene: A hallway, Joey and Ross find Mr. Geller with his ear up against a janitorâs closet door.]

Ross: Dad, what are you doing?

Mr. Geller: I think there are people in there having sex.

(Ross turns to look at Joey.)

Joey: It canât be me, Iâm standing right here.

Mr. Geller: Wanna peek?

Ross: No!

Mr. Geller: Come on!

Ross: Yâknow what? I donât like you without mom. (To Joey) Come on. (Walks away.)

Joey: (To Ross) Weâre not peeking? (Follows him.)

Mr. Geller: Well Iâm peeking. (He peeks.) Oh my God!

Chandler: Hello sir, you know Monica.

[Scene: Rachelâs Room, she is taking the ring out of Rossâs jacket, looks at it, and puts it on her finger as Joey enters.]

Joey: Hey uh, is it okay to come in?

Rachel: Of course! Oh Joey, this ring Iâ¦itâs beautiful I love it!

Joey: Yeah uh look Rach, thereâs something I gotta tell ya.

(Thereâs a knock on the door and a nurse enters carrying Emma.)

Rachel: Hey!

Nurse: Hey! Are you ready to try nursing again?

Rachel: Yeah! Hi Emma. Hey, why do you think she wonât take my breast?

Nurse: Itâs all right honey, it takes some babies a while to get it, but donât worry. Itâll happen.

Joey: (watching) Yowsa! (Looks away.)

Rachel: Okay sweetie, you can do it. Just open up and put it in your mouth.

Joey: Dear Lord.

Rachel: Iâm sorry honey, what were you saying?

Joey: Oh uh-uh yeah, I think thatâ¦

Rachel: Oh look, sheâs pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? (Joey gets embarrassed.) She looks scared. Doesnât she look scared?

Joey: Yâknow, I donât really know her.

Nurse: Why donât we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow. (Does so.)

Joey: (To God) Are you kidding me?!

Rachel: Itâs just so frustrating! Why doesnât she want my breast?!

Joey: I donât know! Maybe sheâs crazy! (Storms out.)

[Scene: The Lobby, Ross is eating a sandwich as Phoebe rushes up to him.]

Phoebe: Oh hey! Wait up!

Ross: Hi!

Phoebe: Congratulations! I didnât want to say anything in front of Joey âcause I didnât know if he knew yet.

Ross: What, that we had a baby? Come on letâs give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.

Phoebe: No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!

Ross: What?

Phoebe: Oh, itâs a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We havenât done the secret thing in a long time.

Ross: Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didnât propose.

Phoebe: Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?

Ross: (pause) I am a doctor! Yâknow what? Iâm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.

Phoebe: All right, me too. (They go into her room and see that sheâs sleeping.) Should we wake her up?

Ross: No! No, come on let her sleep! Sheâs so exhausted.

Phoebe: And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.)

Ross: What? (Motions for Phoebe to go outside with him.) Oh my God! She-she thinks weâre engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think weâre engaged?!

Phoebe: Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Yâknow Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.

Ross: I didnât give her that ring!

Phoebe: Really?

Ross: No!

Phoebe: So whose ring is it?

Ross: Itâs mine.

Phoebe: Is it an engagement ring?

Ross: Yes!

Phoebe: But you didnât give it to her?

Ross: No!

Phoebe: But you were going to propose?

Ross: No!!

Phoebe: Huh, I might be losing interest in this.

Ross: Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybeâ¦kindaâ¦wanted ahâ¦startâ¦things up again.

Phoebe: Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.

Ross: Look, I didnât want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didnât want to either. But I donât, I donât understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?

Phoebe: No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.

Ross: Well I didnât! I didnât propose! (Pause) Unless uhâ¦ (Pause) Did I? I havenât slept in forty hours andâ¦it does sound like something I would do.

Commercial Break

[Scene: The Janitorâs Closet, Chandler and Monica are trying to figure out what to do now.]

Chandler: Look, we canât stay in here forever.

Monica: Oh, I still canât believe my dad saw us having sex! He didnât make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!

Chandler: This is okay. Weâre all adults here; thereâs nothing to be ashamed of. Now, letâs put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (They do so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)

Monica: Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?

Mr. Geller: Of course. Iâll always be your dad.

Chandler: I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasnât for fun.

Monica: It wasnât fun?!

Chandler: (To Monica) Why? Why-why-would youâWh-whyâ¦ (To Mr. Geller) Look, I just donât want you to think that weâre animals who do it whenever we want.

Mr. Geller: Oh, I donât think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time.

Monica: The truth is, Dad, weâre-weâre trying.

Mr. Geller: What?

Monica: Yeah, weâre trying to get pregnant.

Mr. Geller: Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there! (Points to the closet) Iâll guard the door!

Monica: Well, thatâs okay dad, we-we can wait until later.

Mr. Geller: Whoa-whoa-whoa! I donât think so! Arenât you ovulating?

Monica: Daddy?!

Mr. Geller: Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. Thatâs how I got my bad hip.

Chandler: Thatâs funny, this conversationâs how I got the bullet hole in my head.

Mr. Geller: This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she wasâ¦

Monica: Daddy! I donât think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.

Mr. Geller: Youâre right, youâre right. This is about your positions. Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good.

Monica: I donât feel good right now.

Mr. Geller: But pleasure is important, (To Chandler) and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?

Chandler: Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.

[Scene: Rachelâs Room, Monica is entering.]

Monica: Hey.

Rachel: Hey. I need to tell you something.

Monica: Well, nowâs a good time. Iâm on my way to have my ears cut off.

Rachel: Joey asked me marry him.

Monica: What?

Rachel: Joey proposed to me.

Monica: Is he crazy?! You just had Rossâs baby!

Rachel: Well, I-I said yes.

Monica: What?! Are you crazy? You just had Rossâs baby! Itâs-itâs so inappropriate. No, itâs worse than that. Itâs wrong. Itâsâ¦ It is bigger than mine! (Rachelâs engagement ring.)

Rachel: I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.

Monica: You canât marry him!

Rachel: Why not? I donât want to do this alone! And heâs such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.

Monica: Well do you love him?

Rachel: Sure.

Monica: Sure?

Rachel: Yeah, I mean whatever.

Monica: Honey, the question isâ¦do you really want to marry Joey?

Rachel: No. No, I donât. Could you be a dear and go tell him?

[Scene: A Hallway, Chandler is following Joey.]

Chandler: You still havenât told Rachel you werenât really proposing?

Joey: No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.

Chandler: Joey, you have to tell her whatâs going on! And what did it look like?!

Joey: I didnât look at it. Stupid babyâs head was blocking most of it.

Chandler: Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.

Joey: Look, itâs not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I donât want to hurt her.

Chandler: Okay, look, just do it gently.

Joey: Youâre right. Youâre right. I-Iâll go tell her now before Ross finds out and Iâll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there (Points to the closet Chandler and Monica were in) if you want to check that out.

[Scene: Rachelâs Room, Ross is entering.]

Ross: And confused. Rach, sweetie, I-I umâ¦I didnât propose to you.

Rachel: I know.

Ross: I donât think you do.

Rachel: You didnât propose to me. Joey did.

Ross: Poor baby, youâre so tired. Rach, I didnât propose to you, Joey didnât propose to you, and Chandler didnât propose to you.

Rachel: Uhâ¦ You didnât propose to me, Chandler didnât propose to me, but Joey did.

(Joey enters.)

Ross: Joey proposed to you?

Joey: I can come back.

Ross: Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?

Joey: No.

Rachel: Yes you did!

Joey: Actually, technically, I didnât.

Rachel: Well then why did you give me a ring?

Ross: Wait! Whoa-whoa, youâ¦you gave her the ring?

Joey: No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!

Rachel: Yes, you did!

Joey: No, I didnât!

Rachel: Yes, you did!

Joey: No, I didnât!

Rachel: Yes, you did! And donât you say, "No, I didnât!"

Joey: Ahhh!

Rachel: He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.

Ross: Whoa! You were down on one knee?

Joey: Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didnâtâ¦I didnât propose!

Ross: Then what did happen?

Rachel: Yeah, what did happen?

Joey: Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.

Rachel: Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?"

Joey: No, I didnât!

Rachel: Yes, you did!

Joey: No, I didnât!

Rachel: Yes, you didâOh my God you didnât! (Screams) Well then why didnât you tell me that before?!

Joey: Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!

Ross: Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!

Joey: (To Ross) Iâll tell you about it later. Be cool.

Rachel: Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!

Joey: It wasnât my ring! Itâs Rossâs ring! Thatâs why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.

Ross: What?!

Rachel: You were gonna propose to me?

Ross: Uhhâ¦ No.

(An awkward silence follows.)

Joey: Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}

Ross: But I-I was going to see if yâknow, maybe you uh, start dating again but thatâI mean that-that was all, Rach.

Joey: Dude, step up! I proposed.

Ross: No, you didnât!

Joey: Oh thatâs right. Thereâs a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.

(Thereâs a knock on the door and the Nurse enters carrying Emma.)

Nurse: Hey, she just woke up! Sheâs hungry. Why donât we give this another try?

Rachel: Okay.

Ross: (To Joey) I canât believe you told her I was going to propose!

Joey: I canât believe youâre not going to propose!

Ross: Hey, Iâm not going to rush into anything!

Joey: Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!

Rachel: Oh my God!

Ross: What?

Rachel: Sheâs doing it Look, sheâs breast-feeding look!

Rachel: And you really think this is a good idea?

Phoebe: I just talked him into it, donât tell me I have to do you too. The puppet master gets tired people.

Rachel: Oh look, sheâs pulling away again! Do you think my nipples are too big for her mouth? (Joey gets embarrassed.) She looks scared. Doesnât she look scared?

Joey: Yâknow, I donât really know her.

Nurse: Why donât we try massaging the breast to stimulate the flow. (Does so.)

Joey: (To God) Are you kidding me?!

Ross: Hi!

Phoebe: Congratulations! I didnât want to say anything in front of Joey âcause I didnât know if he knew yet.

Ross: What, that we had a baby? Come on letâs give him a little credit, although, he did eat a piece of plastic fruit earlier.

Phoebe: No! No, that you and Rachel are engaged!

Ross: What?

Phoebe: Oh, itâs a secret. Oh goodie! Yes! We havenât done the secret thing in a long time.

Ross: Phoebe, there is no secret. Okay? I didnât propose.

Phoebe: Are you lying? Is this like that time you tried to convince us that you were a doctor?

Ross: (pause) I am a doctor! Yâknow what? Iâm just gonna go and talk to Rachel myself.

Phoebe: All right, me too. (They go into her room and see that sheâs sleeping.) Should we wake her up?

Ross: No! No, come on let her sleep! Sheâs so exhausted.

Phoebe: And so engaged. (Points to the ring that Rachel is wearing.)

Ross: What? (Motions for Phoebe to go outside with him.) Oh my God! She-she thinks weâre engaged! Why? Why? Why would she think weâre engaged?!

Phoebe: Perhaps because you gave her an engagement ring? Yâknow Ross doctors are supposed to be smart.

Ross: I didnât give her that ring!

Phoebe: Really?

Ross: No!

Phoebe: So whose ring is it?

Ross: Itâs mine.

Phoebe: Is it an engagement ring?

Ross: Yes!

Phoebe: But you didnât give it to her?

Ross: No!

Phoebe: But you were going to propose?

Ross: No!!

Phoebe: Huh, I might be losing interest in this.

Ross: Look. Look, my mom gave me that ring because she wanted me to propose to Rachel, but all I wanted to do is if she maybeâ¦kindaâ¦wanted ahâ¦startâ¦things up again.

Phoebe: Oh, what beautiful lukewarm sentiment.

Ross: Look, I didnât want to rush into anything. And it seemed like she didnât want to either. But I donât, I donât understand how any of this happened! What? Did she find the ring in my jacket, assume that I was going to propose, throw it on, and-and just start telling people?

Phoebe: No! No, she said you actually proposed to her.

Ross: Well I didnât! I didnât propose! (Pause) Unless uhâ¦ (Pause) Did I? I havenât slept in forty hours andâ¦it does sound like something I would do.

Commercial Break

[Scene: The Janitorâs Closet, Chandler and Monica are trying to figure out what to do now.]

Chandler: Look, we canât stay in here forever.

Monica: Oh, I still canât believe my dad saw us having sex! He didnât make it to one of piano recitals, but this he sees!

Chandler: This is okay. Weâre all adults here; thereâs nothing to be ashamed of. Now, letâs put our underwear in our pockets and walk out the door. (They do so and find Mr. Geller leaning against a wall stunned.)

Monica: Hi Dad! I can still call you that right?

Mr. Geller: Of course. Iâll always be your dad.

Chandler: I just want you to know that what you witnessed in there, that wasnât for fun.

Monica: It wasnât fun?!

Chandler: (To Monica) Why? Why-why-would youâWh-whyâ¦ (To Mr. Geller) Look, I just donât want you to think that weâre animals who do it whenever we want.

Mr. Geller: Oh, I donât think that. Before today I never thought of you two having sex at all. It was a simpler time.

Monica: The truth is, Dad, weâre-weâre trying.

Mr. Geller: What?

Monica: Yeah, weâre trying to get pregnant.

Mr. Geller: Oh my God! This is so exciting! Well, get back in there! (Points to the closet) Iâll guard the door!

Monica: Well, thatâs okay dad, we-we can wait until later.

Mr. Geller: Whoa-whoa-whoa! I donât think so! Arenât you ovulating?

Monica: Daddy?!

Mr. Geller: Well you gotta get at it princess! When your mother and I were trying to conceive you, whenever she was ovulating, bam, we did it. Thatâs how I got my bad hip.

Chandler: Thatâs funny, this conversationâs how I got the bullet hole in my head.

Mr. Geller: This one time I had my knee up on the sink and your mother, she wasâ¦

Monica: Daddy! I donât think we need to hear about the specific positions you and mom had sex.

Mr. Geller: Youâre right, youâre right. This is about your positions. Now, what I saw in the closet is not the optimum position for conceiving a child, although it might feel good.

Monica: I donât feel good right now.

Mr. Geller: But pleasure is important, (To Chandler) and it helps if the woman has an orgasm. You up to the task sailor?

Chandler: Seriously sir, my brains? All over the wall.

[Scene: Rachelâs Room, Monica is entering.]

Monica: Hey.

Rachel: Hey. I need to tell you something.

Monica: Well, nowâs a good time. Iâm on my way to have my ears cut off.

Rachel: Joey asked me marry him.

Monica: What?

Rachel: Joey proposed to me.

Monica: Is he crazy?! You just had Rossâs baby!

Rachel: Well, I-I said yes.

Monica: What?! Are you crazy? You just had Rossâs baby! Itâs-itâs so inappropriate. No, itâs worse than that. Itâs wrong. Itâsâ¦ It is bigger than mine! (Rachelâs engagement ring.)

Rachel: I know. Days of Our Lives, thank you very much.

Monica: You canât marry him!

Rachel: Why not? I donât want to do this alone! And heâs such a sweet guy and he loves me so much.

Monica: Well do you love him?

Rachel: Sure.

Monica: Sure?

Rachel: Yeah, I mean whatever.

Monica: Honey, the question isâ¦do you really want to marry Joey?

Rachel: No. No, I donât. Could you be a dear and go tell him?

[Scene: A Hallway, Chandler is following Joey.]

Chandler: You still havenât told Rachel you werenât really proposing?

Joey: No! She had the ring on, she seemed so excited, and then she took her breast out.

Chandler: Joey, you have to tell her whatâs going on! And what did it look like?!

Joey: I didnât look at it. Stupid babyâs head was blocking most of it.

Chandler: Go and tell Rachel right now before Ross finds out.

Joey: Look, itâs not that easy. She said she wanted to marry me. I donât want to hurt her.

Chandler: Okay, look, just do it gently.

Joey: Youâre right. Youâre right. I-Iâll go tell her now before Ross finds out and Iâll be gentle. I can do that. I am a gentle person. Oh, by the way. Two people screwing in there (Points to the closet Chandler and Monica were in) if you want to check that out.

[Scene: Rachelâs Room, Ross is entering.]

Rachel: I know.

Ross: I donât think you do.

Rachel: You didnât propose to me. Joey did.

Ross: Poor baby, youâre so tired. Rach, I didnât propose to you, Joey didnât propose to you, and Chandler didnât propose to you.

Rachel: Uhâ¦ You didnât propose to me, Chandler didnât propose to me, but Joey did.

Joey: I can come back.

Ross: Hey, wait! Wait-wait-wait! Joey, did you propose to her?

Joey: No.

Rachel: Yes you did!

Joey: Actually, technically, I didnât.

Rachel: Well then why did you give me a ring?

Ross: Wait! Whoa-whoa, youâ¦you gave her the ring?

Joey: No! No, and I did not ask her to marry me!

Rachel: Yes, you did!

Joey: No, I didnât!

Rachel: Yes, you did!

Joey: No, I didnât!

Rachel: Yes, you did! And donât you say, "No, I didnât!"

Joey: Ahhh!

Rachel: He was right there. He got down on one knee and proposed.

Ross: Whoa! You were down on one knee?

Joey: Yeah. Yeah, that looks bad. But I didnâtâ¦I didnât propose!

Ross: Then what did happen?

Rachel: Yeah, what did happen?

Joey: Okay, the ring fell on the floor and I went down to pick it up and you thought I was proposing.

Rachel: Yeah, but you said, "Will you marry me?"

Joey: No, I didnât!

Rachel: Yes, you did!

Joey: No, I didnât!

Rachel: Yes, you didâOh my God you didnât! (Screams) Well then why didnât you tell me that before?!

Joey: Well I tried, but people kept coming in and then you took your breast out!

Ross: Whoa! Hey! Whoa-whoa-whoa, you saw her breast?!

Joey: (To Ross) Iâll tell you about it later. Be cool.

Rachel: Well then Joey, what the hell were you doing with an engagement ring?!

Joey: It wasnât my ring! Itâs Rossâs ring! Thatâs why I felt so bad Rach, because he was going to propose.

Ross: What?!

Rachel: You were gonna propose to me?

Ross: Uhhâ¦ No.

(An awkward silence follows.)

Joey: Well, this is awkward. {See? I told you so.}

Joey: Oh thatâs right. Thereâs a lot going on here and I think I ate some bad fruit earlier.

(Thereâs a knock on the door and the Nurse enters carrying Emma.)

Nurse: Hey, she just woke up! Sheâs hungry. Why donât we give this another try?

Rachel: Okay.

Ross: (To Joey) I canât believe you told her I was going to propose!

Joey: I canât believe youâre not going to propose!

Ross: Hey, Iâm not going to rush into anything!

Joey: Oh yeah, dude, I totally understand. Usually after I have a baby with a woman I like to slow things down!

Rachel: Oh my God!

Ross: What?

Rachel: Sheâs doing it Look, sheâs breast-feeding look!

Monica: What? Who says that?

Chandler: People whoâve never ever been to Paris.

Monica: Whatâs going on?

Chandler: Weâre moving to Tulsa! (Makes a excited expression on his face)

Monica: Excuse me?

Chandler: Okay, Ms. McKenna, she kind of works above my boss, she asked me to move to Tulsa and be the president of our office there, and I was sleeping and apparently, said yes.

Monica: (stands up angry) Tulsa, Oklahoma!

Chandler: The Sooner State, whatever that is.

Monica: Chandler, I donât even wanna see the musical Oklahoma!

Chandler: Really? Oh What A Beautiful Morning!  Surrey With A Fringe On Top.

Monica: Are you trying to tell me that weâre moving to Oklahoma, or that youâre gay? All right, not that this matters, but did they at least offer you a huge raise?

Chandler: No, no, but they are going to lease us a Ford Focus. (Monicaâs not impressed.) Iâll get out of it.

Monica: Thank you.

Chandler: (hears Emma crying) What is wrong with Emma?

Monica: Oh she misunderstood, she thought she was moving to Tulsa.

[Scene: Ms. McKennaâs Office, Chandler enters.]

Chandler: Umm maâam, do you have a minute? (She points for him to come in) I kind of have some bad news. I donât think I can move to Tulsa.

Ms. McKenna: What?

Chandler: Itâs a funny story, actually. (coughs) I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said Iâd move to Tulsa, I didnât really know what I was saying.

Ms. McKenna: You fell asleep?

Chandler: But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ainât that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright (he sits down). See, hereâs the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she wonât go. See, me, I love Tulsa!  Tulsa is heaven!  Tulsa is ItalyâPlease donât make me go there!

Ms. McKenna: Chandler, Iâ¦

Chandler: No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? (Pause) Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! (She glares at him.) Thatâs a picture of your daughter, isnât it, well sheâs lovely. I like a girl with a strong jaw. Iâll call you from Tulsa. (Exits.)

Joey: Your thumb? Thatâs weird. (Makes a fist.) You sure youâre punching right? Make a fist. (Ross just looks at him with his thumb in a cast.) Maybe later. Ross I feel terrible.

Ross: You know what, you can go, I just have to fill out some forms. (Tries to hold the pen but canât)

Joey: You, you want me to help you with that?

Ross: Why, does it look like Iâm having trouble with my misshapen claw? (He hands Joey the form)

Joey: Name? (Ross looks at him.) I know Ross but whatâs it short for? You know like, like Rossel or Rosstepher.

Joey: Okay, relationship, boy this could take a while.

Ross: Just ahâ¦ just put roommate.

Joey: Come on, you guys are more then that! I mean, youâre gonna get together right?

Ross: I donât think that we are.

Joey: But you two were supposed to be together.

Ross: Well, I thought so too, but then she said sheâd marry you.

Joey: Come on, Ross, that didnât mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.

Ross: Yeah thatâs what she said.

Joey: So?

Ross: So I donât wanna be just anybody.

Joey: Wow.

Ross: You know what, itâs, itâs better this way anyway. I mean I donât know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. Itâs just much easier if weâre just friends who have a kid.

Joey: Really?

Ross: Yeah.

Joey: And youâre Okay with that?

Ross: Yes. I mean, itâs what we always planned.  And if you have a plan, you should stick to it.  Thatâs why they call them plans.  Hello? (Pause) Iâm fine.

Joey: Hey, for what itâs worth, with Rachel I donât think youâll ever be just (Makes quote marks.) "anybody."

Ross: Hey there you go! (Smiles because Joey used it correctly)

Joey: (makes quote marks) "Thanks."

Rachel: Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit. (He sits) You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really wanted to marry Joey, okay?

Ross: Okay.

Rachel: You know what I really really want?

Ross: What, Rach?

Rachel: I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again.

Ross: (smiles) Right.

Rachel: I mean I got news for you mister, Emma?  Not easy.

Ross: Well, thatâs what Iâm here for. (Emma starts crying again) Want me to get that?

Ross: I donât think that we are.

Joey: But you two were supposed to be together.

Ross: Well, I thought so too, but then she said sheâd marry you.

Joey: Come on, Ross, that didnât mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.

Ross: Yeah thatâs what she said.

Joey: So?

Ross: So I donât wanna be just anybody.

Joey: Wow.

Ross: You know what, itâs, itâs better this way anyway. I mean I donât know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. Itâs just much easier if weâre just friends who have a kid.

Joey: Really?

Ross: Yeah.

Joey: And youâre Okay with that?

Ross: Yes. I mean, itâs what we always planned.  And if you have a plan, you should stick to it.  Thatâs why they call them plans.  Hello? (Pause) Iâm fine.

Joey: Hey, for what itâs worth, with Rachel I donât think youâll ever be just (Makes quote marks.) "anybody."

Joey: (makes quote marks) "Thanks."

Rachel: Oh no Ross! This is not good, we have to talk about this Joey thing. Please sit. (He sits) You have got to get over this Joey thing, okay? I never really wanted to marry Joey, okay?

Ross: Okay.

Rachel: You know what I really really want?

Ross: What, Rach?

Rachel: I wanna sleep, I wanna eat, I wanna take a shower, I mean before she wakes up and we gotta do this all over again.

Ross: (smiles) Right.

[Scene: Ross and Rachelâs, Emma continues crying while Rachel, Monica and Phoebe try different methods to stop her crying.]

Phoebe: Well, alright, we already tried feeding her, changing her, burping her, oh try this one! Go back in time and listen to Phoebe!

Monica: Alright hereâs something, it says to try holding the baby close to your body and then swing her rapidly from side to side.

Rachel: Ok. (Starts swinging Emma rapidly and she stops crying)

Monica: It worked!

Rachel: Oh (happy) oh no just stopped to throw up a little bit. (Emma starts crying again.) Oh come on, what am I gonna do, its been hours and it wonât stop crying.

Joey:  Fine, fine okay.  But I gotta say technically, I didnât even do anything wrong.

Ross: (turns back) What! (Angrily) You didnât do anything wrong?!

Joey: I said I didnât technically.

Ross: Okay letâs put aside that you (Makes quote marks with his fingers.) "accidentally" picked up my grandmothers ring and you (Does it again) "accidentally" proposed to Rachel.

Joey: Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this (Makes quote marks with his fingers.) I donât really know what that means. (Ross just looks at him) You were saying?

Monica: Okay whatâs up

Chandler: Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?

Monica: Oh yeah (smiles).

Chandler: Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?

Monica: What? Who says that?

Chandler: Umm maâam, do you have a minute? (She points for him to come in) I kind of have some bad news. I donât think I can move to Tulsa.

Ms. McKenna: What?

Chandler: Itâs a funny story, actually. (coughs) I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said Iâd move to Tulsa, I didnât really know what I was saying.

Ms. McKenna: You fell asleep?

Chandler: But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ainât that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright (he sits down). See, hereâs the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she wonât go. See, me, I love Tulsa!  Tulsa is heaven!  Tulsa is ItalyâPlease donât make me go there!

Ms. McKenna: Chandler, Iâ¦

Chandler: No no no! Look, Carol, can I call you Carol? (Pause) Wh-why would I when your name is Elaine? Oh what a great picture of your son, strapping! (She glares at him.)

Joey: But you two were supposed to be together.

Ross: Well, I thought so too, but then she said sheâd marry you.

Joey: Come on, Ross, that didnât mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.

Ross: Yeah thatâs what she said.

Joey: So?

Ross: So I donât wanna be just anybody.

Joey: Wow.

Ross: You know what, itâs, itâs better this way anyway. I mean I donât know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. Itâs just much easier if weâre just friends who have a kid.

Joey: Really?

Ross: Yeah.

Joey: And youâre Okay with that?

Ross: Yes. I mean, itâs what we always planned.  And if you have a plan, you should stick to it.  Thatâs why they call them plans.  Hello? (Pause) Iâm fine.

Joey: Hey, for what itâs worth, with Rachel I donât think youâll ever be just (Makes quote marks.) "anybody."

Rachel: Ok. (Starts swinging Emma rapidly and she stops crying)

Monica: It worked!

Joey: Look, can I just stop you right there for a second? When people do this (Makes quote marks with his fingers.) I donât really know what that means. (Ross just looks at him) You were saying?

Monica: Okay whatâs up

Chandler: Umm, you know how we always said that it would be fun to move to Paris for a year? You know, you could study French cooking and I could write and we could take a picnic along the Seine and go wine tasting in Bordeaux?

Monica: Oh yeah (smiles).

Chandler: Okay, you know how that people say that Tulsa is the Paris of Oklahoma?

Ms. McKenna: What?

Chandler: Itâs a funny story, actually. (coughs) I kind of fell asleep in the meeting this morning so when I said Iâd move to Tulsa, I didnât really know what I was saying.

Ms. McKenna: You fell asleep?

Chandler: But only because I was up all night worried about this meeting, ainât that funny? Irony? Not a fan, alright (he sits down). See, hereâs the thing. I went home and told my wife about Tulsa and she wonât go. See, me, I love Tulsa!  Tulsa is heaven!  Tulsa is ItalyâPlease donât make me go there!

Ms. McKenna: Chandler, Iâ¦

Joey: But you two were supposed to be together.

Ross: Well, I thought so too, but then she said sheâd marry you.

Joey: Come on, Ross, that didnât mean anything! She just had the baby, she was all freaked out about doing it alone, she would have said yes to anybody.

Ross: Yeah thatâs what she said.

Joey: So?

Ross: So I donât wanna be just anybody.

Joey: Wow.

Ross: You know what, itâs, itâs better this way anyway. I mean I donât know what I was thinking, going down that road again with us. Itâs just much easier if weâre just friends who have a kid.

Joey: Really?

Ross: Yeah.

Joey: And youâre Okay with that?

Ross: Yes. I mean, itâs what we always planned.  And if you have a plan, you should stick to it.  Thatâs why they call them plans.  Hello? (Pause) Iâm fine.

Joey: Hey, for what itâs worth, with Rachel I donât think youâll ever be just (Makes quote marks.) "anybody."

Phoebe: Look at you all grown up.

Joey: Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.

Phoebe: You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!

Monica: It's great! How?

Chandler. Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with you.

Monica: So you're gonna be gone four days a week? (Thinks about it.) No.

Chandler: I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?

Monica: No. I can't be away from you for that long.

Chandler: Really?

Monica: Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.

Chandler: That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.

Monica: Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.

Rachel: Dr. Wiener.

Ross: Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning.

Rachel: Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!

Ross: Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?

Rachel: Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!

Ross: Well, what was it?

Rachel: Hiccups.

Ross: Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.

Rachel: Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?

Ross: Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.

Rachel: Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!

Ross: Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.

Rachel: What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.

Ross: You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like! (Walks back into his room.)

Rachel: (Grabs the phone and stars dialing) (On phone) (In a high pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener (In a low pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener!!!

Joey: Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget?

Phoebe: Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen. She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.

Joey: No.

Phoebe: Come on, give me something. What's his name?

Phoebe: Mike? Okay! What's his last name?

Phoebe: All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.

Joey and Phoebe: (Ad-lib good-byes) (Phoebe leaves)

Joey: Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said... (Looks through his address book) There's no guy in there!

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]

Rachel: It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?

Monica: Excuse me?

Chandler: I know what she's talking about.

Rachel: We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.

Monica: Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?

Rachel: Ross said he died.

Monica: He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.

Rachel: Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.

Monica: Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.

Chandler: He saw a therapist?

Monica: Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.

Rachel: Why? What was it?

Monica: That I was going to eat him.

[Scene: Central Perk]

(Joey walks in and looks around. He's trying to find a Mike for Phoebe)

Joey: MIKE!!!

Mike: Yeah?

Joey: (Checks him out) Okay! (Walks over to his table and sits down with him)

[Scene: Restaurant]

Mike: I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I should be open and taking some risks.

Joey: Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.

Mike: I am Mike.

Joey: Atta boy!

(Phoebe and Mary Ellen enter.)

Joey: Okay, look...

Everyone: (Ad-lib hellos)

Phoebe: Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?

Mike: How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.

Joey: (Laughs) From school.

Mike: Yeah, we met in college. (Off Joey's look) I mean, high school.

Phoebe: Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?

Mike: Well, I'm a lawyer.

Joey: Mike, 'attorney at law'!

Mike: Actually, I just gave up my practice.

Joey: What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.

Mike: I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will.

Phoebe: Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...

Joey: Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.

Mary Ellen: I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.

Joey: No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]

(Monica Enters. Chandler is in the kitchen with his laptop)

Monica: Hey!

Chandler: Hey!

Monica: What are you doing?

Chandler: Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.

Monica: That's so sweet. Find anything?

Chandler: Slim Pickings.

Monica: Nothing, huh?

Chandler: No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.

Monica: 'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.

Chandler: 'So Cheesy' also has an opening.

Monica: Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.

Chandler: Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.

Monica: (On phone) Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo (sp?) is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo (sp?) 'I'll take it!'

[Scene: Pediatrician's office]

Rachel: Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.

Receptionist: Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient, he should be out shortly.

Dr. Gettleman: (To a patient) I think you just have a cold, it's definitely not Strep.

Ross: Thanks doctor.

Dr. Gettleman: Would you like a lollypop?

Ross: You even have to ask?! (He grabs a lollypop out of a jar) (Sees Rachel) (To Rachel) He is alive!

[Scene: Restaurant]

Phoebe: You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.

Joey: Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.

Mike: No, I didn't.

Joey: That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great!

Mary Ellen Wait, is your mom okay?

Joey: Please, we're trying to have a conversation. (Pushes the wine glass closer to Mary Ellen.)

Mary Ellen: Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'.

Mike: 'Days of Our Lives'! That's why you look so familiar!

Phoebe: What?!

Mike: What?!

Joey: What?!

Phoebe: Do you not know each other?

Joey: (Laughs) Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games. (To Mike) Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!

Phoebe: Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?

Mike: (Joey holds up six fingers) Six!

Joey: What are you doing? I said seven! (Holds up six fingers.) (Realizes his mistake) Argh!!!

Phoebe: Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?

Joey: Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.

Mike: I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his mother with a car.

Phoebe: (To Joey) You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.

Mary Ellen: Hey!

Phoebe: Who are you kidding? (To Joey) You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!

Joey: Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one. (Looks around) Mike!! Mike!!

Phoebe: I'm out of here (She leaves)

Mike: It was nice meeting you!

Joey: (To Mary Ellen) You're leaving too?

Mary Ellen: I'll stay if you can tell me my name.

Joey: Good night!

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]

Chandler: Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.

Monica: You're right. (Pause) Maybe I shouldn't go.

Chandler: What?

Monica: So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo (sp?). It's just a little outside of Tulsa.

Chandler: How far outside?

Monica: Manhattan.

Chandler: And you're thinking of taking it? (Pause) So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, (Raises his hand) me, (Raises his hand) new job.

Monica: I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Chandler: What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?

Monica: Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.

Chandler: I think you should take the job.

Monica: Really?

Chandler: Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.

Monica: That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!

(Ross and Rachel enter with Emma.)

Ross: Hey!

Monica: How was the pediatrician?

Rachel: Oh, I really liked him. (Looks at Ross) Yeah, it was really, really, really good.

Ross: You promised you wouldn't say anything.

Rachel: I know. (Pause) Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! (To Ross) I don't care!

Monica: Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?

Ross: He's a brilliant diagnostician!

Chandler: Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?

Rachel: Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.

Ross: Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'

Chandler: Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?

Ross: Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!

Chandler: That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!

Ross: It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!

[Scene: Central Perk]

Mike: Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can we talk?

Phoebe: Sure.

Mike: I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny guy.

Phoebe: Why did you go along with that?

Mike: Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't. And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did.

Phoebe: That's true. (Pause) Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?

Mike: My name in Mike, and I do play piano.

Phoebe: Prove it.

Mike: There isn't a piano here.

Phoebe: That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.

Mike: (Plays 'air piano')

Phoebe: You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.

Mike: Really?

Phoebe: Uhuh.

Mike: That's great. What kind of music do you play?

Phoebe: Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.

Mike: Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...

Phoebe: It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.

Mike: Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out?

Joey: (Walks In)

Phoebe: (To Mike) Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah, that would be nice.

Joey: Look at this. My two best friends!

(Phoebe and Mike look at him, and he goes over to the counter.)

Receptionist: The doctor will be right with you sir.

Girl: (Reading a book) Mommy, I can't find Waldo.

Ross: With the circus? He's behind the elephant.

Woman: Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books too?

Ross: Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.

Sally: Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also a single parent?

Ross: I am a single parent.

Sally: It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone?

Ross: Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.

Nurse: (To Ross) Rossy, we're ready for you.

Ross: Hmm, yeah. (To a random boy in the waiting room) Come on Ross jr. It's time to go in.

Ross: (Enters) Oh good, you haven't left yet.

Chandler: Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy. (They hug)

Chandler: Awww. (They hug) Bye!

Rachel: Bye honey. (They hug)

Chandler: (Tries to hug Joey but J. moves away) What's the matter Joe?

Joey: I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.

Chandler: Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?

Joey: Dude, you see right thru me!! (They hug) (Joey heads for the door and pushes Chandler's suitcase on the way out.)

Chandler: Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!

Phoebe: Okay, bye-bye! (Pushes Chandler out the door.) Good trip! (Slams the door)

Monica: (Runs out to the hallway) Chandler, wait. It goes: Old job, (Raises her hand) new job, (Raises her hand really high) you. This is just something I have to do.

Phoebe: Mike? Okay! What's his last name?

Joey: Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?

Phoebe: All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.

Joey and Phoebe: (Ad-lib good-byes) (Phoebe leaves)

Joey: Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said... (Looks through his address book) There's no guy in there!

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]

Rachel: It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?

Monica: Excuse me?

Chandler: I know what she's talking about.

Rachel: We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.

Monica: Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?

Rachel: Ross said he died.

Monica: He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.

Rachel: Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.

Monica: Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.

Chandler: He saw a therapist?

Monica: Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.

Rachel: Why? What was it?

Monica: That I was going to eat him.

[Scene: Central Perk]

(Joey walks in and looks around. He's trying to find a Mike for Phoebe)

Joey: MIKE!!!

Mike: Yeah?

Joey: (Checks him out) Okay! (Walks over to his table and sits down with him)

[Scene: Restaurant]

Mike: I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I should be open and taking some risks.

Joey: Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.

Mike: I am Mike.

Joey: Atta boy!

(Phoebe and Mary Ellen enter.)

Joey: Okay, look...

Everyone: (Ad-lib hellos)

Phoebe: Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?

Mike: How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.

Joey: (Laughs) From school.

Mike: Yeah, we met in college. (Off Joey's look) I mean, high school.

Phoebe: Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?

Mike: Well, I'm a lawyer.

Joey: Mike, 'attorney at law'!

Mike: Actually, I just gave up my practice.

Joey: What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.

Mike: I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will.

Phoebe: Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...

Joey: Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.

Mary Ellen: I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.

Joey: No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]

(Monica Enters. Chandler is in the kitchen with his laptop)

Monica: Hey!

Chandler: Hey!

Monica: What are you doing?

Chandler: Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.

Monica: That's so sweet. Find anything?

Chandler: Slim Pickings.

Monica: Nothing, huh?

Chandler: No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.

Monica: 'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.

Chandler: 'So Cheesy' also has an opening.

Monica: Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.

Chandler: Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.

Monica: (On phone) Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo (sp?) is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo (sp?) 'I'll take it!'

[Scene: Pediatrician's office]

Rachel: Hi, my name is Rachel Green, I have an appointment for Emma.

Receptionist: Dr. Gettleman is finishing up with a patient, he should be out shortly.

Dr. Gettleman: (To a patient) I think you just have a cold, it's definitely not Strep.

Ross: Thanks doctor.

Dr. Gettleman: Would you like a lollypop?

Ross: You even have to ask?! (He grabs a lollypop out of a jar) (Sees Rachel) (To Rachel) He is alive!

[Scene: Restaurant]

Phoebe: You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.

Joey: Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.

Mike: No, I didn't.

Joey: That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great!

Mary Ellen Wait, is your mom okay?

Joey: Please, we're trying to have a conversation. (Pushes the wine glass closer to Mary Ellen.)

Mary Ellen: Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'.

Mike: 'Days of Our Lives'! That's why you look so familiar!

Phoebe: What?!

Mike: What?!

Joey: What?!

Phoebe: Do you not know each other?

Joey: (Laughs) Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games. (To Mike) Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!

Phoebe: Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?

Mike: (Joey holds up six fingers) Six!

Joey: What are you doing? I said seven! (Holds up six fingers.) (Realizes his mistake) Argh!!!

Phoebe: Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?

Joey: Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.

Mike: I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his mother with a car.

Phoebe: (To Joey) You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.

Mary Ellen: Hey!

Phoebe: Who are you kidding? (To Joey) You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!

Joey: Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one. (Looks around) Mike!! Mike!!

Phoebe: I'm out of here (She leaves)

Mike: It was nice meeting you!

Joey: (To Mary Ellen) You're leaving too?

Mary Ellen: I'll stay if you can tell me my name.

Joey: Good night!

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]

Chandler: Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.

Monica: You're right. (Pause) Maybe I shouldn't go.

Chandler: What?

Monica: So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo (sp?). It's just a little outside of Tulsa.

Chandler: How far outside?

Monica: Manhattan.

Chandler: And you're thinking of taking it? (Pause) So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, (Raises his hand) me, (Raises his hand) new job.

Monica: I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Chandler: What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?

Monica: Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.

Chandler: I think you should take the job.

Monica: Really?

Chandler: Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.

Monica: That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!

(Ross and Rachel enter with Emma.)

Ross: Hey!

Monica: How was the pediatrician?

Rachel: Oh, I really liked him. (Looks at Ross) Yeah, it was really, really, really good.

Ross: You promised you wouldn't say anything.

Rachel: I know. (Pause) Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! (To Ross) I don't care!

Monica: Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?

Ross: He's a brilliant diagnostician!

Chandler: Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?

Rachel: Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.

Ross: Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'

Chandler: Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?

Ross: Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!

Chandler: That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!

Ross: It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!

[Scene: Central Perk]

Mike: Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can we talk?

Phoebe: Sure.

Mike: I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny guy.

Phoebe: Why did you go along with that?

Mike: Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't. And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did.

Phoebe: That's true. (Pause) Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?

Mike: My name in Mike, and I do play piano.

Phoebe: Prove it.

Mike: There isn't a piano here.

Phoebe: That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.

Mike: (Plays 'air piano')

Phoebe: You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.

Mike: Really?

Phoebe: Uhuh.

Mike: That's great. What kind of music do you play?

Phoebe: Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.

Mike: Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...

Phoebe: It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.

Mike: Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out?

Joey: (Walks In)

Phoebe: (To Mike) Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah, that would be nice.

Joey: Look at this. My two best friends!

(Phoebe and Mike look at him, and he goes over to the counter.)

Ross: Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me.

Receptionist: The doctor will be right with you sir.

Girl: (Reading a book) Mommy, I can't find Waldo.

Ross: With the circus? He's behind the elephant.

Woman: Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books too?

Ross: Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.

Sally: Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also a single parent?

Ross: I am a single parent.

Sally: It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone?

Ross: Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.

Nurse: (To Ross) Rossy, we're ready for you.

Ross: Hmm, yeah. (To a random boy in the waiting room) Come on Ross jr. It's time to go in.

Boy: Mommy (He walks over to Sally.)

Girl: Mommy, what's wrong with that man?

Ross: Hey, I helped you find Waldo!

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]

Ross: (Enters) Oh good, you haven't left yet.

Monica: Where have you been?

Ross: I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office. There was some guy that freaked everybody out.

Chandler: Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy. (They hug)

Ross: Oh man.

Chandler: Awww. (They hug) Bye!

Rachel: Bye honey. (They hug)

Chandler: (Tries to hug Joey but J. moves away) What's the matter Joe?

Joey: I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.

Chandler: Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?

Joey: Dude, you see right thru me!! (They hug) (Joey heads for the door and pushes Chandler's suitcase on the way out.)

Chandler: Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!

Phoebe: Okay, bye-bye! (Pushes Chandler out the door.) Good trip! (Slams the door)

Monica: I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing (Points to her wedding ring.)

Chandler: There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?

Joey: Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.

Chandler: I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.

Joey: (Laughs)

Rachel: Every time? (She takes up her cell phone and starts dialing.)

Ross: Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...

Rachel: I'm on the phone! (On the phone) Dr. Wiener? (Ross and Rachel walk away)

Joey: (Laughs)

Phoebe: It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It's just so grown up.

Joey: I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me. (Laughs)

Phoebe: Look at you all grown up.

Joey: Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.

Phoebe: You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!

Joey: I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?

Phoebe: Done. Oh good, really?

Monica: It's great! How?

Chandler. Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with you.

Monica: So you're gonna be gone four days a week? (Thinks about it.) No.

Chandler: I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?

Monica: No. I can't be away from you for that long.

Chandler: Really?

Monica: Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.

Chandler: That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.

Monica: Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.

Ross: Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.

Rachel: Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!

Ross: Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.

Rachel: What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.

Ross: You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like! (Walks back into his room.)

Rachel: (Grabs the phone and stars dialing) (On phone) (In a high pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener (In a low pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener!!!

Joey: That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great!

Mary Ellen Wait, is your mom okay?

Joey: Please, we're trying to have a conversation. (Pushes the wine glass closer to Mary Ellen.)

Mary Ellen: Wow, you're a lot nicer on 'Days of Our Lives'.

Mike: 'Days of Our Lives'! That's why you look so familiar!

Phoebe: What?!

Mike: What?!

Joey: What?!

Phoebe: Do you not know each other?

Joey: (Laughs) Of course we do! Mike is playing a game that we used to play in high school. Yeah, where we pretend we don't know each other. We played all kinds of games. (To Mike) Hey, remember the one where I punch you in the face for not being cool?!

Phoebe: Mike, let me ask you something. How many sisters does Joey have?

Mike: (Joey holds up six fingers) Six!

Joey: What are you doing? I said seven! (Holds up six fingers.) (Realizes his mistake) Argh!!!

Phoebe: Joey, why did you set me up with a stranger?

Joey: Because I forgot about our date, I'm so sorry.

Mike: I'm sorry too. And just to be clear, I didn't hit his mother with a car.

Phoebe: (To Joey) You are unbelievable! I spent so much time finding the perfect girl for you, you know. Mary Ellen is really smart and cute and loose.

Mary Ellen: Hey!

Phoebe: Who are you kidding? (To Joey) You just find some guy off the street for me? Oh God! This is humiliating!

Joey: Look Phoebe I'm so sorry! Hey, look, if you don't like this guy I can find you a better one. (Looks around) Mike!! Mike!!

Phoebe: I'm out of here (She leaves)

Mike: It was nice meeting you!

Joey: (To Mary Ellen) You're leaving too?

Mary Ellen: I'll stay if you can tell me my name.

Joey: Good night!

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]

Chandler: Honey, we're leaving tomorrow you've still got a lot of packing to do.

Monica: You're right. (Pause) Maybe I shouldn't go.

Chandler: What?

Monica: So Nancy told me about this job at this great restaurant, Javo (sp?). It's just a little outside of Tulsa.

Chandler: How far outside?

Monica: Manhattan.

Chandler: And you're thinking of taking it? (Pause) So before you said being me with me was more important than any job, but I guess now it's old job, (Raises his hand) me, (Raises his hand) new job.

Monica: I'm gonna miss this hand! Okay I know it's a lot to ask, but oh my God Chandler, this is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Chandler: What happened to 'you can't live without me four days a week'?

Monica: Well, if you really think about it, I mean four days is not that long. I mean, I see you Monday before you go to work, and I see you Thursday when you get back, and I always work late on Tuesdays, so really if you think about it, it's really just one day. And well, if we can't make it one day, we've got real problems my friend.

Chandler: I think you should take the job.

Monica: Really?

Chandler: Yeah. I know it must be important to you when you start chattering like a monkey.

Monica: That's the nicest anyone has ever said to me!

(Ross and Rachel enter with Emma.)

Ross: Hey!

Monica: How was the pediatrician?

Rachel: Oh, I really liked him. (Looks at Ross) Yeah, it was really, really, really good.

Ross: You promised you wouldn't say anything.

Rachel: I know. (Pause) Ross still sees his pediatrician!!! (To Ross) I don't care!

Monica: Are you serious? You still see Dr. Gettleman?

Ross: He's a brilliant diagnostician!

Chandler: Diagnostician or boo-boo fixer?

Rachel: Ross, seriously! You've gotta go to an appropriate doctor.

Ross: Why? Why? I know it's a little weird, but hey, he's a great doctor, okay? He knows my medical history, and every time I go in there, he makes a big deal. 'Ah look, it's my favorite patient!'

Chandler: Does he say that before he sticks his thermometer in your touchy?

Ross: Hey, I seem to remember someone bringing his security blanket to college!

Chandler: That was not a security blanket! That was a wall-hanging!

Ross: It didn't spend much time on the wall!!!

[Scene: Central Perk]

Mike: Excuse me, hi. I was hoping I would run into you. Can we talk?

Phoebe: Sure.

Mike: I'm sorry, really, I'm so embarrassed. Really, I'm a pretty nice guy. Just ask my parole officer...Apparently I'm not a funny guy.

Phoebe: Why did you go along with that?

Mike: Because I was told I'd get a free dinner, which I didn't. And that I'd meet a pretty girl. Which I did.

Phoebe: That's true. (Pause) Well, is anything you told me about yourself true?

Mike: My name in Mike, and I do play piano.

Phoebe: Prove it.

Mike: There isn't a piano here.

Phoebe: That wouldn't stand in the way of a true pianist.

Mike: (Plays 'air piano')

Phoebe: You are really good! I play a little guitar myself.

Mike: Really?

Phoebe: Uhuh.

Mike: That's great. What kind of music do you play?

Phoebe: Well, like acoustic folksy stuff. You know? But right now I'm working on a couple 'Iron Maiden' covers.

Mike: Do you think that maybe, sometime, I could...

Phoebe: It's okay. Go ahead, ask me out.

Mike: Okay. Do you think maybe sometime I could take you out?

Joey: (Walks In)

Phoebe: (To Mike) Oh, you just caught me off guard! Yeah, that would be nice.

Joey: Look at this. My two best friends!

(Phoebe and Mike look at him, and he goes over to the counter.)

Ross: Excuse me, I don't mean to be a jerk, but the baby with the rash came in after me.

Receptionist: The doctor will be right with you sir.

Girl: (Reading a book) Mommy, I can't find Waldo.

Ross: With the circus? He's behind the elephant.

Woman: Wow, so your child is a big fan of the Waldo books too?

Ross: Yeah, that's how I know. I'm Ross by the way.

Sally: Hi, I'm Sally. So, no ring. Can I assume you are also a single parent?

Ross: I am a single parent.

Sally: It's hard isn't it? There's almost no time for a social life. I mean, where are you gonna meet someone?

Ross: Well, let's say, I don't know, you met someone in the pediatrician's office.

Nurse: (To Ross) Rossy, we're ready for you.

Ross: Hmm, yeah. (To a random boy in the waiting room) Come on Ross jr. It's time to go in.

Boy: Mommy (He walks over to Sally.)

Girl: Mommy, what's wrong with that man?

Ross: Hey, I helped you find Waldo!

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]

Ross: (Enters) Oh good, you haven't left yet.

Chandler: Well, you got here just in time. I really have to go buddy. (They hug)

Ross: Oh man.

Monica: Promise to call me when you land.

Chandler: Of course I will call you. I love you.

Monica: I love you too. (They kiss)

Rachel: Okay, wow, wow, wow. Watch the tongue people, we've got a baby over here.

Phoebe: Bye Chandler.

Chandler: Awww. (They hug) Bye!

Rachel: Bye honey. (They hug)

Chandler: (Tries to hug Joey but J. moves away) What's the matter Joe?

Joey: I'm mad at you for leaving! You're nothing but a big leaver. Big leaver with a stupid suitcase.

Chandler: Any chance you are trying to pick a fight to make all this easier?

Joey: Dude, you see right thru me!! (They hug) (Joey heads for the door and pushes Chandler's suitcase on the way out.)

Chandler: Well, bye Mon, bye Ross, Rachel, bye Emma!

Phoebe: Okay, bye-bye! (Pushes Chandler out the door.) Good trip! (Slams the door)

Monica: (Runs out to the hallway) Chandler, wait. It goes: Old job, (Raises her hand) new job, (Raises her hand really high) you. This is just something I have to do.

Chandler: I know.

Rachel: Hi!

Ross: Hey! So what's the big news you had us rush all the way over here for?

Chandler: Okay, our news. My company has asked me to head up our office in Tulsa , so as of Monday I'm being officially relocated.

Ross: Oh my God!

Phoebe: What?!

Rachel: What?!

Ross: Monday?!

Joey: How long do you have to go for?

Chandler: They said it could be up to a year.

Joey: A year?!

Rachel: (To Monica) Do you have to go?

Monica: I kind of have to don't I? Because of this stupid thing (Points to her wedding ring.)

Chandler: There is nothing like the support of your loving wife, huh?

Joey: Wait a minute, you can't go to Tulsa. Maybe you forgot, but we've got tickets to the Jets game next week.

Chandler: I'm sorry buddy, but I don't think I'm gonna be able to make it.

Joey: We were gonna go see the Jets!

Ross: You can't go, I mean you're the glue that holds this group together!

[Scene: Central Perk]

Joey: Here you are (Hands Rachel a cup of coffee)

Rachel: Thank you Joey. You know what? I'm not even sure I can have caffeine.

Ross: I went thru this with Ben and Carol. One cup of coffee won't affect your milk.

Rachel: Yeah. Just to be sure I'm gonna call Dr. Wiener.

Joey: (Laughs)

Rachel: Every time? (She takes up her cell phone and starts dialing.)

Joey: Uhuh.

Ross: Rach, you don't have to call whenever you have a little question, okay? Trust me, I know this.

Rachel: All right, I trust you. (Continues to dial)

Ross: Rachel, I can see you dialing! I don't understand why...

Rachel: I'm on the phone! (On the phone) Dr. Wiener? (Ross and Rachel walk away)

Joey: (Laughs)

Phoebe: It's so weird seeing Ross and Rachel with a baby. It's just so grown up.

Joey: I know, yeah. I feel like we're all growing up. Person named Wiener, God that kills me. (Laughs)

Phoebe: Look at you all grown up.

Joey: Actually, you know what? I am. That whole thing with Rachel made me realize that maybe I'm ready for a more serious relationship. You know? Like I'd like to meet a nice mature commitment-minded lady. And looks aren't as important as...Nah, she's gotta be hot.

Phoebe: You know, I might know somebody. Hey, how about you set me up with someone, and we double date!

Joey: I can do that, yeah. How is Friday?

Phoebe: Done. Oh good, really?

Joey: Yeah!

Phoebe: Let's see! (Opens her address book.) Oh, you know who's great? Sandy Poophack.

Chandler: (Enters) Hey!

Monica: Hey!

Chandler: I've got good news!

Monica: You got out of the whole Tulsa thing?

Chandler: Okay, I have news. You don't have to move to Tulsa. You can stay here and keep your job.

Monica: It's great! How?

Chandler. Well my boss and I worked out a deal where I only have to be in Tulsa four days a week, so the other three I can be here with you.

Monica: So you're gonna be gone four days a week? (Thinks about it.) No.

Chandler: I'm sorry, are you just used to saying that?

Monica: No. I can't be away from you for that long.

Chandler: Really?

Monica: Yeah, you're my husband. I'm not gonna live in a different state than you for 208 days out of the year.

Chandler: That's fast math! We could use you in Tulsa.

Monica: Honey, thanks for trying to figure out a way, but if you're going to Tulsa, I wanna go with you.

Chandler: Hey, you said that without gagging!

Monica: I know! (They high-five.)

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment]

Rachel: (On the phone) Excuse me? Oh yeah? Well, up yours too! (Hangs up)

Ross: (Enters from his bedroom)Who the hell was that?!

Rachel: Dr. Wiener.

Ross: Rach, you can't call people at three in the morning.

Rachel: Oh you know what, you sound just like his wife!

Ross: Was there anything you did wrong with Emma?

Rachel: Yes, of course there is! Okay? I'm not insane!

Ross: Well, what was it?

Rachel: Hiccups.

Ross: Rach, I told you, you can't call him every time any little thing comes up.

Rachel: Yeah well, not anymore I can't. He fired us! What are we gonna do? We have to find a pediatrician. Wait wait, Monica said that when you guys were growing up, you really liked your doctor. What was his name?

Ross: Dr. Gettleman? Yeah I know, I don't think that's a good idea. In fact, I think he's dead.

Rachel: Argh! Why does everything happen to me?!

Ross: Rach, I promise first thing tomorrow we'll find another doctor, but I gotta get up early and I'm not feeling all that well.

Rachel: What? What, do you mean you're not feeling well? What do you have? Is it Rubella? Because don't go near Emma, she has not had that shot.

Ross: You know? Come to think of it, it does feel Rubella-like! (Walks back into his room.)

Rachel: (Grabs the phone and stars dialing) (On phone) (In a high pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener (In a low pitch voice) Wiener, Wiener!!!

Ross: (Comes back into the living room) Rachel!!!

Phoebe: So how is this for our big double date tonight? (She is all dressed up)

Joey: (Realizes that he has forgotten all about the double date) Oh my God!

Phoebe: Ooh, great! Just the reaction I was hoping for.

Joey: Yeah, so you found someone for me. You didn't forget?

Phoebe: Of course not! And you're gonna love Mary Ellen. She's really smart and cute and funny, and I can't tell you how I know this, but she' not opposed to threesomes. So tell me some about my guy.

Joey: No.

Phoebe: Come on, give me something. What's his name?

Joey: Mike.

Phoebe: Mike? Okay! What's his last name?

Joey: Damnit! Is there no mystery left in romance anymore!?

Phoebe: All right, we'll se you and Mike at the restaurant in a couple hours.

Joey and Phoebe: (Ad-lib good-byes) (Phoebe leaves)

Joey: Why did I have to say Mike? I don't know a Mike! Why couldn't I have said... (Looks through his address book) There's no guy in there!

[Scene: Chandler and Monica's apartment]

Rachel: It's impossible to find a good doctor. I mean, how do you know the good ones from the ones who are gonna push their penis against your knee?

Monica: Excuse me?

Chandler: I know what she's talking about.

Rachel: We've got to find a new pediatrician. Ross was getting sick last night, and I think Emma may have caught it.

Monica: Why don't you go see Dr. Gettleman?

Rachel: Ross said he died.

Monica: He didn't die. I saw his daughter last week. Said he was fine. Her on the other hand, botched Botox.

Rachel: Oh, great! Well, then I'm gonna take Emma to see him. I wonder why Ross said that he died.

Monica: Oh, maybe he was getting him confused with his childhood therapist.

Chandler: He saw a therapist?

Monica: Yeah, he used to have this recurring nightmare, just really freaked him out.

Rachel: Why? What was it?

Monica: That I was going to eat him.

[Scene: Central Perk]

(Joey walks in and looks around. He's trying to find a Mike for Phoebe)

Joey: MIKE!!!

Mike: Yeah?

Joey: (Checks him out) Okay! (Walks over to his table and sits down with him)

[Scene: Restaurant]

Mike: I gotta tell you, I can't believe I'm doing this with you. Although I did just get out of a nine-year relationship, so I guess I should be open and taking some risks.

Joey: Everything is gonna be fine. Just follow my lead, okay? All you have to do is pretend to be Mike.

Mike: I am Mike.

Joey: Atta boy!

(Phoebe and Mary Ellen enter.)

Joey: Okay, look...

Everyone: (Ad-lib hellos)

Phoebe: Joey, this is Mary Ellen Jenkins. So, Mike, how do you and Joey know each other anyway?

Mike: How do I and Joey know each other? Wow, if I had a nickel for every time somebody has asked me that.

Joey: (Laughs) From school.

Mike: Yeah, we met in college. (Off Joey's look) I mean, high school.

Phoebe: Wow, you guys go way back then. So what are you up to these days?

Mike: Well, I'm a lawyer.

Joey: Mike, 'attorney at law'!

Mike: Actually, I just gave up my practice.

Joey: What? That's the kinda thing you usually run by me.

Mike: I always wanted to play piano professionally, and I figured if I don't do this now, I never will.

Phoebe: Wow, that's great! I liked that better than the law thing, so...

Joey: Which is why I waited until now to introduce you to Mike.

Mary Ellen: I thought you thought he was still a lawyer.

Joey: No, no, that's not what I meant. Let's get you a cocktail.

Chandler: Hey!

Monica: What are you doing?

Chandler: Looking for restaurant jobs for you in Tulsa.

Monica: That's so sweet. Find anything?

Chandler: Slim Pickings.

Monica: Nothing, huh?

Chandler: No, 'Slim Pickings', it's a barbecue restaurant. They're looking for a cook. Actually 'cook' may be a bit of a stretch. They're looking for someone to shovel mesquite.

Monica: 'Slim Pickings'...That is so cheesy.

Chandler: 'So Cheesy' also has an opening.

Monica: Honey, that's okay. I actually know this woman, Nancy, who's a restaurant biz head-hunter. Maybe she'll know of something.

Chandler: Can I just say how much I appreciate you coming with me. When we get to Tulsa I'm taking you for a great dinner at 'Slim Pickings'. 'So Cheesy'? 'Whole Hog'? It's going to be tough to keep Kosher in Tulsa.

Monica: (On phone) Hi, Nancy. Hi, it's Monica Geller. I'm good. Listen, I'm looking for a job in Tulsa. Well yeah, my husband has been relocated...Because I love him! No, I don't want a job in New York. Javo (sp?) is looking? Oh my God! He asked for me personally? Oh my God! Oh, wow, this is really flattering, but I'm moving to Tulsa. Yeah, so if you would tell Javo (sp?) 'I'll take it!'

Ross: Thanks doctor.

Dr. Gettleman: Would you like a lollypop?

Ross: You even have to ask?! (He grabs a lollypop out of a jar) (Sees Rachel) (To Rachel) He is alive!

[Scene: Restaurant]

Phoebe: You know, it's so surprising that you and Joey have known each other for so long and I've never heard about you.

Joey: Yeah, that's because we had a bit of a falling out. Mike hit my mom with a car.

Mike: No, I didn't.

Joey: That's okay Mike, I have forgiven you. And now we're friends again everything's great!

(The female next to Chandler starts smoking, towards her:) Ah, Claudia, arenï¿½t you supposed to blow smoke up the bossesï¿½ ass?

Claudia: Iï¿½m sorry. Does the smoke bother you?

Chandler: No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I canï¿½t remember why. (to everyone:) Youï¿½re not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?

Claudia: Yes, in Oklahoma itï¿½s legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less. (passing the pack) Would you like one?

Chandler: Alright, loï¿½look. I donï¿½t smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, itï¿½s fine. (everyone lights up) So you all smoke then? Thatï¿½s almost rude, that Iï¿½m not.

Ken: Thatï¿½s not true. If you donï¿½t wanna smoke ï¿½

Chandler: (loud) Ken, please! No, I canï¿½t, I canï¿½t smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.

Ken: Iï¿½m sorry, but isnï¿½t your wife back in New York?

Chandler: I always liked you, Ken. (takes a cigarette)

Phoebe: Ohh. Oh wait! (Jis) you guys wonï¿½t be late for my dinner, will you?

Monica: Believe me, Chandler and I have not seen each other in over a week. Weï¿½ll probably be the first ones there.

Phoebe: ï¿½kay, see you there. Happy humping! (outside meeting Chandler.) Heyï¿½hey! Oh, wow, somebody smoked out here? Oh my god, donï¿½t people know, youï¿½re not allowed to smoke in public spaces?

Chandler: Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.

Phoebe: You smoked!

Chandler: No! I just happened tï¿½do a lot trivias about smoking in different states. For example, in Hawaii cigarettes are called Leyhallalookoos.

Chandler: Uch, do you think, Monica is gonna be able smell it?

Phoebe: Are you kidding? The woman has the nose of a bloodhound ï¿½ and the breasts of a Greek goddess.

Chandler: Pheebs?

Phoebe: (embarrassed) Iï¿½m gonna go. (leaves to stairs)

Chandler: (getting in) Okay, something to cover the smell ï¿½ Oven cleaner! (sprays himself, reads label) Unscented!

Monica: (naughty in doorway) Welcome home. Iï¿½ve missed you. join me in the bedroom?

Chandler: No thanks, Iï¿½m good.

Monica: (comes over) O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?

Chandler: (shrinks back) Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so Iï¿½m feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.

Monica: You donï¿½t need a shower.

Chandler: (still backs away) Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulences.

Monica: What do I smell? (sniffs him) I smell smoke. Huhï¿½did you smoke?

Chandler: Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five. A pack. Two packï¿½aï¿½a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. (How many cigarettes are there in one pack and how many packs in one carton in the US?) But itï¿½s over, I made a decision, Iï¿½m not gonna smoke anymore.

Monica: (gets a pack out of his jacket)

Chandler: But, those are for you.

Ross: Oh, what were the other two?

Rachel: Well, letï¿½s see. The first one is: I donï¿½t want to. And, you know, Iï¿½m not going.

Ross: I know, itï¿½s the first time, weï¿½re leaving the baby and ï¿½ hey, I know how hard it is for you, but ï¿½ but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. Sheï¿½s great with kids.

Rachel: She is?

Ross: Ya.

Rachel: What about (?) Monica.

Ross: Hey, you only heard Monicaï¿½s side of that. That little fatso was a terror.

Rachel: Ish. I just donï¿½t think I can bear it.

Ross: Rachel, I know that you can. And you should.

Rachel: Uch.

Ross: Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why donï¿½t you, why donï¿½t you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then Iï¿½ll meet you there.

Rachel: Oh-A.

Ross: No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red. (Slang right?)

Rachel: You need to learn some new slang.

Ross: Iï¿½m serious. Cï¿½mon, you should go. Here. (shoves her outside, while she tries to stay) No, uh-uh, just go.

Rachel: What ï¿½ Oh! (points inside)

Joey: No, theyï¿½re cominï¿½, weï¿½re waitinï¿½ right here.

Chandler: I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.

Monica: So what? Donï¿½t you have any will power?

Monica: You said that was sexy!

Chandler: ï¿½kay, look: Can we just drop this? Iï¿½m not gonna smoke again.

Chandler: You forbid me?

Monica: Mhmm.

Chandler: You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?

Monica: Donï¿½t joke (?) with me, okay? Iï¿½m very, very upset right now.

Chandler: Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?

Monica: Yes.

Chandler: Then, I might as well ï¿½ (grabs the cigarettes) do this (lights one, exhales). Not really sure what to do now.

Monica: Well, Iï¿½ll tell you what weï¿½re gonna do: We are already late for Phoebeï¿½s birthday dinner, so you point out put out that cigarette, weï¿½re gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex.

Chandler: Fine. What!?

Monica: Sex! This is the last day Iï¿½m ovulating, and when we donï¿½t do it now, weï¿½ll have to wait till next month. (walks towards bedroom)

Ross: You never cooked since 1996. (Actually Rachel cooked in ï¿½609 - TOW Ross Got Highï¿½, first aired 1999-11-25.)

Rachel: Is the window open? Because if thereï¿½s a window open, a bird could fly in there.

Ross: Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think youï¿½re right. I think ï¿½ listen, listen!

Rachel: Ubb.

Ross: A pigeon, a pigeon. (previously scared Rachel turns away) No, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty birdï¿½s aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays (?) are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.

Rachel: Boy, are you gonna be sorry if thatï¿½s true.

Waiter: You canï¿½t order until your entire party has arrived. Restaurant policy.

Joey: Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But thereï¿½s still some food left on their place, okay, whatï¿½s the restaurantï¿½s policy about people eatinï¿½ that?

Waiter: Estrangement (?).

Joey: But it happens? (waiter leaves) Iï¿½m gotta go to the bathroom.

Phoebe: No, you canï¿½t go. No-no-no, I canï¿½t hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I cave.

Chandler: Look, I canï¿½t do this. I canï¿½t make luv to you while weï¿½re fighting this way.

Monica: Oh sure, now youï¿½re Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncleï¿½s funeral

Chandler: That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, Iï¿½m not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?

Monica: No, youï¿½re right. Mnya, we shouldnï¿½t do it like this. Huch. For what itï¿½s worth, Iï¿½m, Iï¿½m sorry. I shouldnï¿½t have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.

Chandler: Mean it?

Monica: Yah.

Chandler: You are incredible. Unless, Iï¿½Iï¿½m not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you. (they kiss)

Ross: Great. So letï¿½s get going?

Rachel: Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, Iï¿½m never leaving her again.

Ms. Geller: I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his clothes, tucked his ??? between his legs and cried out: ï¿½Mommy, Iï¿½m a girl, take me with you.ï¿½

Ross: Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.

Chandler: Uhh. You are welcome.

Monica: You know what? Letï¿½s not talk.

Chandler: What?

Chandler: But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettesï¿½no big deal.

Monica: Oh, blablablabaybaybay.

Chandler: Leave it.

Monica: I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldnï¿½t have sex with me while weï¿½re fighting.

Chandler: You tricked me to get me into bed?

Monica: Thatï¿½s right, I got mine.

Chandler: I feel so used.

[Scene: Restaurant, still just the not-couple.]

Phoebe: Well, I guess theyï¿½re not coming. You wanna just order?

Joey: Thank you. (stands up and kisses her lips.) Waiter! ï¿½lright, this is gonna be fast, so try to keep up: Risotto with the shaped truffles and the roasted rip steak with the golden Chanterelles and a Bordelaise sauce and that any that stuff I just said means snails. (Hope, *I* kept up.)

Waiter: Iï¿½ll just wait to put your order in.

Rachel: N-it wasnï¿½t easy, but itï¿½s your birthday and I did what I got to do.

Phoebe: And thatï¿½s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?

Rachel: Oh honey, this is for the best, thus Iï¿½m not distracted, worrying about Emma, how sheï¿½s doing at home and Iï¿½m being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!

Ross: What?

Rachel: She spit up. Judy! She spiï¿½Judy! Look alive, Judy! (they sit down) Thank you.

Ross: Thanks. Oh.

Rachel: Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?

Joey: (mumbling) Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.

Ross: Yï¿½know this ??? is incredible.

Joey: Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.

Ross: Okay, Iï¿½ll have the fixed salad and the duck.

Rachel: Yah, Iï¿½ll have the soup and the salmon.

Joey: And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because ï¿½

Monica: (entering with husband) Happy birthday!

Joey: Son of a bitch!

Phoebe: Wher-where have you been?

Monica: Well, we had a little fight.

Chandler: I would never lie to get someone into bed.

Monica: You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. (being sat down) Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isnï¿½t it? How dï¿½you get a bigger table? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.

Chandler: I suppose that Monica will have the ï¿½ manipulative shrew.

Waiter: Iï¿½ll give you another minute.

Joey: Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew! (runs after the waiter)

Ross: Rach, cï¿½mon, Emma is fine. Youï¿½re turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.

Rachel: Yï¿½guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?

Chandler: You mean the lully story?

Ross: (childish) Huh-huh, they already know it.

Phoebe: You guys, weï¿½ve been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.

Joey: (returned) No, no, itï¿½s okay, I already told the waiter what they want.

Monica: Why would you do that?

Joey: Chandler, control your woman!

Rachel: (lifts for a toast) Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast ï¿½ to Phoebe. She dropped her sock.

Phoebe: Aw ï¿½ what?

Rachel: N-no, Emma dropped her sock.

Monica: Momï¿½s here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.

Rachel: Ross, she still has not noticed that the babyï¿½s sock is on the ground.

Phoebe: ï¿½s a good toast.

Rachel: (to Ross) Could you please get her attention?

Ross: W-oa ï¿½ Mommy! (gestures to his not understanding mother)

Phoebe: (getting up) Oh, for godï¿½s sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! (everybody scared) Iï¿½m sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt (?) the hideousness (?) that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didnï¿½t even have the courtesy to call. (her cellular rings) Well, itï¿½s too late now.

Ross: Well, ??? think thatï¿½s us?

Phoebe: well, this is, this is, this is not over! (on phone) Hello?

Joey: (to Chandler and Monica) Well, what is going on with you two?

Monica: Uch, you see, Iï¿½m ovulating.

Chandler: Oh yeah, thatï¿½s what she says. But maybe youï¿½re not ovulating at all, maybe itï¿½s just a clever ruse to get me into bed.

Monica: Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just canï¿½t get enough.

Chandler: (to Joey) You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.

Joey: So? Did have sex, right?

Chandler: Whatï¿½s the matter with me? Why Iï¿½m such a girl?

Phoebe: (returns) Okay, that was Mike.

Rachel: Phoebe, hi, weï¿½re so sorry. Youï¿½re totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.

Phoebe: Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, nkay, Iï¿½m gonna take off.

Rachel: What?

Phoebe: Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, Iï¿½m not tï¿½not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! (waves to the bar) Judy! Bye.

Rachel: Oh thank god, if Phoebeï¿½s going, can we please take Emma home?

Ross: You know, I think thatï¿½s a good ideaï¿½our babysitter just pounded in another Chardonnet. (both get up) Bye, yï¿½guys.

Monica: Bye.

Joey: See ya. Well, this is just us.

Monica & Chandler: Mhum.

Monica: So, Iï¿½m, Iï¿½m probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?

Chandler: So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?

Joey: Do, do you gonna do it now?

Monica: We donï¿½t have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct ï¿½

Joey: No-ohoh. (the Bings leave, the waiter comes)

Chandler: Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five. A pack. Two packï¿½aï¿½a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days. (How many cigarettes are there in one pack and how many packs in one carton in the US?) But itï¿½s over, I made a decision, Iï¿½m not gonna smoke anymore.

Monica: (gets a pack out of his jacket)

Chandler: But, those are for you.

Ross: Oh, what were the other two?

Rachel: Well, letï¿½s see. The first one is: I donï¿½t want to. And, you know, Iï¿½m not going.

Ross: I know, itï¿½s the first time, weï¿½re leaving the baby and ï¿½ hey, I know how hard it is for you, but ï¿½ but Emma is gonna be fine. My mom is gonna be with her. Sheï¿½s great with kids.

Rachel: She is?

Ross: Ya.

Rachel: What about (?) Monica.

Ross: Hey, you only heard Monicaï¿½s side of that. That little fatso was a terror.

Rachel: Ish. I just donï¿½t think I can bear it.

Ross: Rachel, I know that you can. And you should.

Rachel: Uch.

Ross: Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why donï¿½t you, why donï¿½t you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then Iï¿½ll meet you there.

Rachel: Oh-A.

Ross: No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red. (Slang right?)

Rachel: You need to learn some new slang.

Ross: Iï¿½m serious. Cï¿½mon, you should go. Here. (shoves her outside, while she tries to stay) No, uh-uh, just go.

Rachel: What ï¿½ Oh! (points inside)

Ross: No! No, you know what? (closes the door) You [canï¿½t get in there] (?), the babyï¿½s fine, now squam (?). Yeah, [I told you a|Tell your] story walking. (?)

Joey: What about me, he? Only had one lunch today.

Waiter: (with British accent) Soo, are we expecting the rest of our party shortly?

Phoebe: Yes, they are expected presently. Yeah, yeah um, their arrival is in the offing.

Joey: No, theyï¿½re cominï¿½, weï¿½re waitinï¿½ right here.

Phoebe: Joseph! (to waiter) Thou neednï¿½t worry, they shanï¿½t be long.

Waiter: Itï¿½s just that we do have some large parties waiting.

Phoebe: One really does have a stick up oneï¿½s ass. Doesnï¿½t one?

Monica: How can you smoke in this day of age? Do you not seen that ad with a little kid walks to grandpa, itï¿½s chilling.

Chandler: I messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.

Monica: So what? Donï¿½t you have any will power?

Chandler: Will power? Iï¿½ve watch home movies of you eating ding-dongs (?) without taking the tin foil off.

Monica: You said that was sexy!

Chandler: ï¿½kay, look: Can we just drop this? Iï¿½m not gonna smoke again.

Monica: Thatï¿½s right, because I forbid you to smoke again.

Chandler: You forbid me?

Monica: Mhmm.

Chandler: You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?

Monica: Donï¿½t joke (?) with me, okay? Iï¿½m very, very upset right now.

Chandler: Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?

Monica: Yes.

Chandler: Then, I might as well ï¿½ (grabs the cigarettes) do this (lights one, exhales). Not really sure what to do now.

Monica: Well, Iï¿½ll tell you what weï¿½re gonna do: We are already late for Phoebeï¿½s birthday dinner, so you point out put out that cigarette, weï¿½re gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex.

Chandler: Fine. What!?

Monica: Sex! This is the last day Iï¿½m ovulating, and when we donï¿½t do it now, weï¿½ll have to wait till next month. (walks towards bedroom)

Chandler: You serious? (follows)

Monica: Oh yeah!

Chandler: Right, fine, Iï¿½ll do it, but no talking.

Rachel: Alright, I canï¿½t, I canï¿½t wait that long. You have to do somethingï¿½knock that door down!

Ross: I would, but I bruise like a peach. Besides, yï¿½you know, everything is gonna be fine. The babyï¿½s sleeping.

Rachel: What if she jumped out the bassinet?

Ross: Canï¿½t hold her own head up, but yeah jumped.

Rachel: Oh my god, I left the water running.

Ross: Rach you did not leave the water running. Please, just pull yourself together, okay?

Rachel: Ah, did I leave the stove on?

Ross: You never cooked since 1996. (Actually Rachel cooked in ï¿½609 - TOW Ross Got Highï¿½, first aired 1999-11-25.)

Rachel: Is the window open? Because if thereï¿½s a window open, a bird could fly in there.

Ross: Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think youï¿½re right. I think ï¿½ listen, listen!

Rachel: Ubb.

Ross: A pigeon, a pigeon. (previously scared Rachel turns away) No, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty birdï¿½s aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays (?) are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.

Rachel: Boy, are you gonna be sorry if thatï¿½s true.

[Scene: The restaurant with still just Phoebe and Joey.]

Phoebe & Joey: Hey.

Waiter: Itï¿½s been an hour. ??? be willing to reconsider switching to a smaller table.

Joey: Maybe we should just eat now.

Waiter: You canï¿½t order until your entire party has arrived. Restaurant policy.

Joey: Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But thereï¿½s still some food left on their place, okay, whatï¿½s the restaurantï¿½s policy about people eatinï¿½ that?

Waiter: Estrangement (?).

Joey: But it happens? (waiter leaves) Iï¿½m gotta go to the bathroom.

Phoebe: No, you canï¿½t go. No-no-no, I canï¿½t hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I cave.

Joey: If you ask me to stay, Iï¿½ll pee. (leaves)

Maitre Dï¿½: Good evening, Miss. (Phoebe turns her head away) Miss? (from the opposite side) Miss? (she turns again) Miss!

Phoebe: Okay, fine, Iï¿½ll move. Alright, you donï¿½t have to manhandle me. (gets up) Where? (he points at a smaller table) Okay. Thank you. Wach.

[Scene: The Bingsï¿½ bedroom, Chandler is undressing, Monica in bed already.]

Monica: Spend more time with the tie. Thatï¿½ll make a baby.

Chandler: Look, I canï¿½t do this. I canï¿½t make luv to you while weï¿½re fighting this way.

Monica: Oh sure, now youï¿½re Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncleï¿½s funeral

Chandler: That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, Iï¿½m not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?

Monica: No, youï¿½re right. Mnya, we shouldnï¿½t do it like this. Huch. For what itï¿½s worth, Iï¿½m, Iï¿½m sorry. I shouldnï¿½t have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.

Chandler: Mean it?

Monica: Yah.

Chandler: You are incredible. Unless, Iï¿½Iï¿½m not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you. (they kiss)

Monica: Dï¿½you want to?

Chandler: Yeah, letï¿½s celebrate life!

Monica: ï¿½kay.

Ross: Great. So letï¿½s get going?

Rachel: Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, Iï¿½m never leaving her again.

Ms. Geller: I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his clothes, tucked his ??? between his legs and cried out: ï¿½Mommy, Iï¿½m a girl, take me with you.ï¿½

Ross: Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.

[Scene: Bings in bed, finished.]

Chandler: Uhh. You are welcome.

Monica: You know what? Letï¿½s not talk.

Chandler: What?

Monica: Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.

Chandler: But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettesï¿½no big deal.

Monica: Oh, blablablabaybaybay.

Chandler: Leave it.

Monica: I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldnï¿½t have sex with me while weï¿½re fighting.

Chandler: You tricked me to get me into bed?

Monica: Thatï¿½s right, I got mine.

Chandler: I feel so used.

[Scene: Restaurant, still just the not-couple.]

Phoebe: Well, I guess theyï¿½re not coming. You wanna just order?

Joey: Thank you. (stands up and kisses her lips.) Waiter! ï¿½lright, this is gonna be fast, so try to keep up: Risotto with the shaped truffles and the roasted rip steak with the golden Chanterelles and a Bordelaise sauce and that any that stuff I just said means snails. (Hope, *I* kept up.)

Waiter: Erï¿½does not.

Phoebe: Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?

Waiter: Oh, theyï¿½re both exclusï¿½

Phoebe: Both it is, thank you.

Joey: Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request: Can you bring everything as soon as itï¿½s ready? Appetizers, entrees, we donï¿½t care.

Ross & Rachel: (entering) Hey, hi, hi!

Waiter: Iï¿½ll just wait to put your order in.

Phoebe: You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?

Ross: Iï¿½m so sorry ï¿½

Rachel: We got locked out of the apartment, we ï¿½

Joey: Thatï¿½s a great storyï¿½can I eat it?

Ross: And then Rachel wasnï¿½t sure she could leave the baby.

Rachel: N-it wasnï¿½t easy, but itï¿½s your birthday and I did what I got to do.

Phoebe: And thatï¿½s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?

Rachel: Oh honey, this is for the best, thus Iï¿½m not distracted, worrying about Emma, how sheï¿½s doing at home and Iï¿½m being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!

Ross: What?

Rachel: She spit up. Judy! She spiï¿½Judy! Look alive, Judy! (they sit down) Thank you.

Ross: Thanks. Oh.

Rachel: Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?

Joey: (mumbling) Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.

Ross: Yï¿½know this ??? is incredible.

Joey: Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.

Ross: Okay, Iï¿½ll have the fixed salad and the duck.

Rachel: Yah, Iï¿½ll have the soup and the salmon.

Joey: And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because ï¿½

Monica: (entering with husband) Happy birthday!

Joey: Son of a bitch!

Phoebe: Wher-where have you been?

Monica: Well, we had a little fight.

Chandler: I would never lie to get someone into bed.

Monica: You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. (being sat down) Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isnï¿½t it? How dï¿½you get a bigger table? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.

Chandler: I suppose that Monica will have the ï¿½ manipulative shrew.

Waiter: Iï¿½ll give you another minute.

Joey: Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew! (runs after the waiter)

Ross: Rach, cï¿½mon, Emma is fine. Youï¿½re turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.

Rachel: Yï¿½guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?

Chandler: You mean the lully story?

Ross: (childish) Huh-huh, they already know it.

Phoebe: You guys, weï¿½ve been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.

Joey: (returned) No, no, itï¿½s okay, I already told the waiter what they want.

Monica: Why would you do that?

Joey: Chandler, control your woman!

Rachel: (lifts for a toast) Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast ï¿½ to Phoebe. She dropped her sock.

Phoebe: Aw ï¿½ what?

Rachel: N-no, Emma dropped her sock.

Monica: Momï¿½s here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.

Rachel: Ross, she still has not noticed that the babyï¿½s sock is on the ground.

Phoebe: ï¿½s a good toast.

Rachel: (to Ross) Could you please get her attention?

Ross: W-oa ï¿½ Mommy! (gestures to his not understanding mother)

Phoebe: (getting up) Oh, for godï¿½s sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! (everybody scared) Iï¿½m sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt (?) the hideousness (?) that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didnï¿½t even have the courtesy to call. (her cellular rings) Well, itï¿½s too late now.

Ross: Well, ??? think thatï¿½s us?

Phoebe: well, this is, this is, this is not over! (on phone) Hello?

Joey: (to Chandler and Monica) Well, what is going on with you two?

Monica: Uch, you see, Iï¿½m ovulating.

Chandler: Oh yeah, thatï¿½s what she says. But maybe youï¿½re not ovulating at all, maybe itï¿½s just a clever ruse to get me into bed.

Monica: Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just canï¿½t get enough.

Chandler: (to Joey) You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.

Joey: So? Did have sex, right?

Chandler: Whatï¿½s the matter with me? Why Iï¿½m such a girl?

Phoebe: (returns) Okay, that was Mike.

Rachel: Phoebe, hi, weï¿½re so sorry. Youï¿½re totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.

Phoebe: Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, nkay, Iï¿½m gonna take off.

Rachel: What?

Phoebe: Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, Iï¿½m not tï¿½not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! (waves to the bar) Judy! Bye.

Rachel: Oh thank god, if Phoebeï¿½s going, can we please take Emma home?

Ross: You know, I think thatï¿½s a good ideaï¿½our babysitter just pounded in another Chardonnet. (both get up) Bye, yï¿½guys.

Monica: Bye.

Joey: See ya. Well, this is just us.

Monica & Chandler: Mhum.

Monica: So, Iï¿½m, Iï¿½m probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?

Chandler: So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?

Joey: Do, do you gonna do it now?

Monica: We donï¿½t have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct ï¿½

Joey: No-ohoh. (the Bings leave, the waiter comes)

Ross: So, so, is Mike coming to dinner?

Phoebe: No! Itï¿½s my first birthday with a boyfriend, and he has to work. Uch, I get mad at him, but I think itï¿½s a little to soon to show my true colors.

Rachel: Pheebs, I would make a reservation for five, because one of us has to stay home and watch Emma. (to Ross:) Which one of us should go to dinner?

Phoebe: Oh, Rachel!

Ross: Actually, um, I was thinking maybe both of us could go.

Phoebe: Oh, yay!

Ross: Thanks, I put a lot of extra thoughts on your gift.

Opening Credits

[Scene: Tulsa, a conference room. Chandler is chairing a group of eight people.]

Chandler: Good morning everyone, itï¿½s nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? (colleague raises hand) Yes, Ken is it?

Ken: Thatï¿½s right. Is it true, that the reason you are here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?

Chandler: (laughs) Well, donï¿½t believe everything you hear, Ken. (both turning away to files) But yeah, thatï¿½s true. Alright, letï¿½s get started, by take a look at last quarterï¿½s figures. (The female next to Chandler starts smoking, towards her:) Ah, Claudia, arenï¿½t you supposed to blow smoke up the bossesï¿½ ass?

Claudia: Iï¿½m sorry. Does the smoke bother you?

Chandler: No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I canï¿½t remember why. (to everyone:) Youï¿½re not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?

Claudia: Yes, in Oklahoma itï¿½s legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less. (passing the pack) Would you like one?

Chandler: Alright, loï¿½look. I donï¿½t smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, itï¿½s fine. (everyone lights up) So you all smoke then? Thatï¿½s almost rude, that Iï¿½m not.

Ken: Thatï¿½s not true. If you donï¿½t wanna smoke ï¿½

Chandler: (loud) Ken, please! No, I canï¿½t, I canï¿½t smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.

Ken: Iï¿½m sorry, but isnï¿½t your wife back in New York?

Chandler: I always liked you, Ken. (takes a cigarette)

Chandler: Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.

Phoebe: You smoked!

Chandler: (shrinks back) Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so Iï¿½m feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.

Monica: You donï¿½t need a shower.

Chandler: (still backs away) Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulences.

Monica: What do I smell? (sniffs him) I smell smoke. Huhï¿½did you smoke?

Rachel: Oh-A.

Ross: No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red. (Slang right?)

Monica: You said that was sexy!

Chandler: ï¿½kay, look: Can we just drop this? Iï¿½m not gonna smoke again.

Chandler: You forbid me?

Monica: Mhmm.

Chandler: You know, I flew a long way t see my loving wife? Is she here by the way?

Monica: Donï¿½t joke (?) with me, okay? Iï¿½m very, very upset right now.

Chandler: Oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?

Monica: Yes.

Chandler: Then, I might as well ï¿½ (grabs the cigarettes) do this (lights one, exhales). Not really sure what to do now.

Monica: Well, Iï¿½ll tell you what weï¿½re gonna do: We are already late for Phoebeï¿½s birthday dinner, so you point out put out that cigarette, weï¿½re gonna put this fight on hold and go have sex.

Chandler: Fine. What!?

Ross: You never cooked since 1996. (Actually Rachel cooked in ï¿½609 - TOW Ross Got Highï¿½, first aired 1999-11-25.)

Rachel: Is the window open? Because if thereï¿½s a window open, a bird could fly in there.

Ross: Oh my god, you know what, yeah, I think youï¿½re right. I think ï¿½ listen, listen!

Rachel: Ubb.

Ross: A pigeon, a pigeon. (previously scared Rachel turns away) No, no wait, no-no, an eagle flew in. Landed on the stove and caught fire. The baby, seeing this, jumps across the apartment to the mighty birdï¿½s aid. The eagle, however, misconstrues as an act of aggression and grabs the baby on its talon. Meanwhile the faucet fills the apartment with water. Baby and bird still up lays (?) are locked in a death grip, swirling around the whirl pool, that fills the apartment.

Rachel: Boy, are you gonna be sorry if thatï¿½s true.

Joey: Maybe we should just eat now.

Waiter: You canï¿½t order until your entire party has arrived. Restaurant policy.

Joey: Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But thereï¿½s still some food left on their place, okay, whatï¿½s the restaurantï¿½s policy about people eatinï¿½ that?

Waiter: Estrangement (?).

Joey: But it happens? (waiter leaves) Iï¿½m gotta go to the bathroom.

Phoebe: No, you canï¿½t go. No-no-no, I canï¿½t hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I cave.

Joey: If you ask me to stay, Iï¿½ll pee. (leaves)

Maitre Dï¿½: Good evening, Miss. (Phoebe turns her head away) Miss? (from the opposite side) Miss? (she turns again) Miss!

Monica: Spend more time with the tie. Thatï¿½ll make a baby.

Chandler: Look, I canï¿½t do this. I canï¿½t make luv to you while weï¿½re fighting this way.

Monica: Oh sure, now youï¿½re Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncleï¿½s funeral

Chandler: That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, Iï¿½m not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?

Monica: No, youï¿½re right. Mnya, we shouldnï¿½t do it like this. Huch. For what itï¿½s worth, Iï¿½m, Iï¿½m sorry. I shouldnï¿½t have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.

Chandler: Mean it?

Monica: Yah.

Chandler: You are incredible. Unless, Iï¿½Iï¿½m not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you. (they kiss)

Ross: Great. So letï¿½s get going?

Rachel: Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, Iï¿½m never leaving her again.

Ms. Geller: I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his clothes, tucked his ??? between his legs and cried out: ï¿½Mommy, Iï¿½m a girl, take me with you.ï¿½

Ross: Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.

Chandler: Uhh. You are welcome.

Monica: You know what? Letï¿½s not talk.

Chandler: What?

Monica: Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.

Chandler: But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettesï¿½no big deal.

Monica: Oh, blablablabaybaybay.

Chandler: Leave it.

Monica: I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldnï¿½t have sex with me while weï¿½re fighting.

Chandler: You tricked me to get me into bed?

Monica: Thatï¿½s right, I got mine.

Chandler: I feel so used.

[Scene: Restaurant, still just the not-couple.]

Phoebe: Well, I guess theyï¿½re not coming. You wanna just order?

Waiter: Iï¿½ll just wait to put your order in.

Ross: Iï¿½m so sorry ï¿½

Rachel: We got locked out of the apartment, we ï¿½

Joey: Thatï¿½s a great storyï¿½can I eat it?

Ross: And then Rachel wasnï¿½t sure she could leave the baby.

Rachel: N-it wasnï¿½t easy, but itï¿½s your birthday and I did what I got to do.

Phoebe: And thatï¿½s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?

Rachel: Oh honey, this is for the best, thus Iï¿½m not distracted, worrying about Emma, how sheï¿½s doing at home and Iï¿½m being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!

Ross: What?

Rachel: She spit up. Judy! She spiï¿½Judy! Look alive, Judy! (they sit down) Thank you.

Ross: Thanks. Oh.

Joey: (mumbling) Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.

Ross: Yï¿½know this ??? is incredible.

Joey: Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.

Ross: Okay, Iï¿½ll have the fixed salad and the duck.

Rachel: Yah, Iï¿½ll have the soup and the salmon.

Joey: And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because ï¿½

Monica: (entering with husband) Happy birthday!

Joey: Son of a bitch!

Phoebe: Wher-where have you been?

Monica: Well, we had a little fight.

Chandler: I would never lie to get someone into bed.

Monica: You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. (being sat down) Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isnï¿½t it? How dï¿½you get a bigger table? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.

Chandler: I suppose that Monica will have the ï¿½ manipulative shrew.

Waiter: Iï¿½ll give you another minute.

Joey: Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew! (runs after the waiter)

Ross: Rach, cï¿½mon, Emma is fine. Youï¿½re turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.

Rachel: Yï¿½guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?

Chandler: You mean the lully story?

Ross: (childish) Huh-huh, they already know it.

Phoebe: You guys, weï¿½ve been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.

Joey: (returned) No, no, itï¿½s okay, I already told the waiter what they want.

Monica: Why would you do that?

Joey: Chandler, control your woman!

Rachel: (lifts for a toast) Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast ï¿½ to Phoebe. She dropped her sock.

Phoebe: Aw ï¿½ what?

Rachel: N-no, Emma dropped her sock.

Monica: Momï¿½s here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.

Rachel: Ross, she still has not noticed that the babyï¿½s sock is on the ground.

Phoebe: ï¿½s a good toast.

Rachel: (to Ross) Could you please get her attention?

Ross: W-oa ï¿½ Mommy! (gestures to his not understanding mother)

Phoebe: (getting up) Oh, for godï¿½s sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! (everybody scared) Iï¿½m sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt (?) the hideousness (?) that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didnï¿½t even have the courtesy to call. (her cellular rings) Well, itï¿½s too late now.

Ross: Well, ??? think thatï¿½s us?

Phoebe: well, this is, this is, this is not over! (on phone) Hello?

Joey: (to Chandler and Monica) Well, what is going on with you two?

Monica: Uch, you see, Iï¿½m ovulating.

Chandler: Oh yeah, thatï¿½s what she says. But maybe youï¿½re not ovulating at all, maybe itï¿½s just a clever ruse to get me into bed.

Monica: Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just canï¿½t get enough.

Chandler: (to Joey) You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.

Joey: So? Did have sex, right?

Chandler: Whatï¿½s the matter with me? Why Iï¿½m such a girl?

Phoebe: (returns) Okay, that was Mike.

Rachel: Phoebe, hi, weï¿½re so sorry. Youï¿½re totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.

Phoebe: Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, nkay, Iï¿½m gonna take off.

Rachel: What?

Phoebe: Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, Iï¿½m not tï¿½not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! (waves to the bar) Judy! Bye.

Rachel: Oh thank god, if Phoebeï¿½s going, can we please take Emma home?

Ross: You know, I think thatï¿½s a good ideaï¿½our babysitter just pounded in another Chardonnet. (both get up) Bye, yï¿½guys.

Monica: Bye.

Joey: See ya. Well, this is just us.

Monica & Chandler: Mhum.

Monica: So, Iï¿½m, Iï¿½m probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?

Chandler: So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?

Joey: Do, do you gonna do it now?

Monica: We donï¿½t have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct ï¿½

Joey: No-ohoh. (the Bings leave, the waiter comes)

Opening Credits

[Scene: Tulsa, a conference room. Chandler is chairing a group of eight people.]

Chandler: Good morning everyone, itï¿½s nice to see our team together for the first time. Now, before we get started, are there any questions? (colleague raises hand) Yes, Ken is it?

Ken: Thatï¿½s right. Is it true, that the reason you are here in Tulsa is that you fell asleep in a meeting and took the job without realizing what you were saying yes to?

Chandler: (laughs) Well, donï¿½t believe everything you hear, Ken. (both turning away to files) But yeah, thatï¿½s true. Alright, letï¿½s get started, by take a look at last quarterï¿½s figures. (The female next to Chandler starts smoking, towards her:) Ah, Claudia, arenï¿½t you supposed to blow smoke up the bossesï¿½ ass?

Claudia: Iï¿½m sorry. Does the smoke bother you?

Chandler: No, no, no-no-no. I smoked for years, then I quit. Right now, I canï¿½t remember why. (to everyone:) Youï¿½re not allowed to smoke in this office. Not right?

Claudia: Yes, in Oklahoma itï¿½s legal to smoke in offices with fifteen people or less. (passing the pack) Would you like one?

Chandler: Alright, loï¿½look. I donï¿½t smoke anymore. But if the rest of you want to light up, go ahead, itï¿½s fine. (everyone lights up) So you all smoke then? Thatï¿½s almost rude, that Iï¿½m not.

Ken: Thatï¿½s not true. If you donï¿½t wanna smoke ï¿½

Chandler: (loud) Ken, please! No, I canï¿½t, I canï¿½t smoke. If I smoke, my wife would kill me.

Chandler: Actually, in Oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.

Phoebe: You smoked!

Monica: (comes over) O-kay, so you wanna play it that way, do you?

Chandler: (shrinks back) Right. You know what? Actually I just get off the plane, so Iï¿½m feeling kinda gross. Maybe I should just take a shower.

Monica: You donï¿½t need a shower.

Chandler: (still backs away) Alright, the truth is, I soiled myself during some turbulences.

Monica: What do I smell? (sniffs him) I smell smoke. Huhï¿½did you smoke?

Chandler: Yes, but I just had one. Two. Two tiny cigarettes. Okay, five. A pack. Two packï¿½aï¿½a carton. Three big fat cartons in two days.

Rachel: She is?

Ross: Ya.

Rachel: What about (?) Monica.

Ross: Hey, you only heard Monicaï¿½s side of that. That little fatso was a terror.

Rachel: Ish. I just donï¿½t think I can bear it.

Rachel: Uch.

Ross: Really, it would be good for you and in fact, why donï¿½t you, why donï¿½t you go ahead to the restaurant and I will wait for my mom and then Iï¿½ll meet you there.

Rachel: Oh-A.

Ross: No, no, really. You should go. Just go! Go! Go out! Really, the world is your oyster. Kick up the heels. Paint the town red. (Slang right?)

Rachel: You need to learn some new slang.

Joey: Wha-a how about this: Another table leaves, right? But thereï¿½s still some food left on their place, okay, whatï¿½s the restaurantï¿½s policy about people eatinï¿½ that?

Waiter: Estrangement (?).

Joey: But it happens? (waiter leaves) Iï¿½m gotta go to the bathroom.

Phoebe: No, you canï¿½t go. No-no-no, I canï¿½t hold this table on my own. If they ask me to move, I cave.

Joey: If you ask me to stay, Iï¿½ll pee. (leaves)

Maitre Dï¿½: Good evening, Miss. (Phoebe turns her head away) Miss? (from the opposite side) Miss? (she turns again) Miss!

Phoebe: Okay, fine, Iï¿½ll move. Alright, you donï¿½t have to manhandle me. (gets up) Where? (he points at a smaller table) Okay. Thank you. Wach.

Joey: (returns to their old table where elderly people are sitting now, sits) Finally you guys made it. (looks up, turns left to Phoebeï¿½s chair) Pheebs, who the hellï¿½uhuhh!

[Scene: The Bingsï¿½ bedroom, Chandler is undressing, Monica in bed already.]

Monica: Spend more time with the tie. Thatï¿½ll make a baby.

Chandler: Look, I canï¿½t do this. I canï¿½t make luv to you while weï¿½re fighting this way.

Monica: Oh sure, now youï¿½re Mister Sensitivity. But when you wanted to have sex right after my uncleï¿½s funeral

Chandler: That was a celebration of life. Alright, look, Iï¿½m not gonna do this. Alright, is this really the way you want a baby to be conceived?

Monica: No, youï¿½re right. Mnya, we shouldnï¿½t do it like this. Huch. For what itï¿½s worth, Iï¿½m, Iï¿½m sorry. I shouldnï¿½t have come down on you so hard about the smoking. So you had a few cigarettes, not the end of the world.

Chandler: Mean it?

Monica: Yah.

Chandler: You are incredible. Unless, Iï¿½Iï¿½m not gonna smoke again. And if I do, I promise, I will hide it so much better from you. (they kiss)

Monica: Dï¿½you want to?

Chandler: Yeah, letï¿½s celebrate life!

Monica: ï¿½kay.

[Scene: Ms. Geller, Rachel and Ross storm into the apartment.]

Rachel: Och, god. (seeing Emma) Oh, thank god, youï¿½re okay. Iï¿½m so sorry we left you. Mom never gonna leave you again. Never ever ever again. Uch.

Ross: Great. So letï¿½s get going?

Rachel: Oh no. I mean it. After what just happened, Iï¿½m never leaving her again.

Ms. Geller: I understand, separation is hard. One time I was about to leave Ross to go to the beauty parlor and he got so upset, he took off all his clothes, tucked his ??? between his legs and cried out: ï¿½Mommy, Iï¿½m a girl, take me with you.ï¿½

Ross: Somehow over time it got easier to be apart from you.

[Scene: Bings in bed, finished.]

Chandler: Uhh. You are welcome.

Monica: You know what? Letï¿½s not talk.

Chandler: What?

Monica: Uch. I am still so mad at you for smoking.

Chandler: But you said you forgave me. It was just a couple of cigarettesï¿½no big deal.

Monica: Oh, blablablabaybaybay.

Chandler: Leave it.

Monica: I was just saying that because I was ovulating and you said you wouldnï¿½t have sex with me while weï¿½re fighting.

Chandler: You tricked me to get me into bed?

Monica: Thatï¿½s right, I got mine.

Chandler: I feel so used.

[Scene: Restaurant, still just the not-couple.]

Phoebe: Well, I guess theyï¿½re not coming. You wanna just order?

Joey: Thank you. (stands up and kisses her lips.) Waiter! ï¿½lright, this is gonna be fast, so try to keep up: Risotto with the shaped truffles and the roasted rip steak with the golden Chanterelles and a Bordelaise sauce and that any that stuff I just said means snails. (Hope, *I* kept up.)

Waiter: Erï¿½does not.

Phoebe: Tomato tart and which of the pastas would you recommend?

Waiter: Oh, theyï¿½re both exclusï¿½

Phoebe: Both it is, thank you.

Joey: Oh, uh, again. Can I make a special request: Can you bring everything as soon as itï¿½s ready? Appetizers, entrees, we donï¿½t care.

Ross & Rachel: (entering) Hey, hi, hi!

Waiter: Iï¿½ll just wait to put your order in.

Phoebe: You guys are over an hour late. What happened to you two?

Ross: Iï¿½m so sorry ï¿½

Rachel: We got locked out of the apartment, we ï¿½

Joey: Thatï¿½s a great storyï¿½can I eat it?

Ross: And then Rachel wasnï¿½t sure she could leave the baby.

Rachel: N-it wasnï¿½t easy, but itï¿½s your birthday and I did what I got to do.

Phoebe: And thatï¿½s Judy over there at the bar with Emma?

Rachel: Oh honey, this is for the best, thus Iï¿½m not distracted, worrying about Emma, how sheï¿½s doing at home and Iï¿½m being completely here with you and, oh, she spit up!

Ross: What?

Rachel: She spit up. Judy! She spiï¿½Judy! Look alive, Judy! (they sit down) Thank you.

Ross: Thanks. Oh.

Rachel: Oh, ooh, everything looks delicious. What should I ha-ave? What should I have?

Joey: (mumbling) Never hit a woman. Never hit a woman.

Ross: Yï¿½know this ??? is incredible.

Joey: Ross bruises like a peach. He bruises like a peach.

Ross: Okay, Iï¿½ll have the fixed salad and the duck.

Rachel: Yah, Iï¿½ll have the soup and the salmon.

Joey: And remember whatever comes up first. Okay? And hurry, because ï¿½

Monica: (entering with husband) Happy birthday!

Joey: Son of a bitch!

Phoebe: Wher-where have you been?

Monica: Well, we had a little fight.

Chandler: I would never lie to get someone into bed.

Monica: You used to tell girls you were a Kennedy. (being sat down) Ooh, uh, thanks. Wow, little tight, isnï¿½t it? How dï¿½you get a bigger table? You-you had a big table, but they made you move. Huh-huh, shut up Monica. Whoo, I suppose that Chandler will have the smoked duck.

Chandler: I suppose that Monica will have the ï¿½ manipulative shrew.

Waiter: Iï¿½ll give you another minute.

Joey: Why are you going? He said, she wanted the shrew! (runs after the waiter)

Ross: Rach, cï¿½mon, Emma is fine. Youï¿½re turning into an obsessive mother. Okay, you need to stop.

Rachel: Yï¿½guys ever heard the story about when Rosses mom went to the beauty salon?

Chandler: You mean the lully story?

Ross: (childish) Huh-huh, they already know it.

Phoebe: You guys, weï¿½ve been waiting for you for a long time, maybe you should order.

Joey: (returned) No, no, itï¿½s okay, I already told the waiter what they want.

Monica: Why would you do that?

Joey: Chandler, control your woman!

Rachel: (lifts for a toast) Okay, as everybody has ordered, I would like to start the celebration and make a toast ï¿½ to Phoebe. She dropped her sock.

Phoebe: Aw ï¿½ what?

Rachel: N-no, Emma dropped her sock.

Monica: Momï¿½s here? I wanted to have lunch with her today, she told me she was out of town.

Rachel: Ross, she still has not noticed that the babyï¿½s sock is on the ground.

Phoebe: ï¿½s a good toast.

Rachel: (to Ross) Could you please get her attention?

Ross: W-oa ï¿½ Mommy! (gestures to his not understanding mother)

Phoebe: (getting up) Oh, for godï¿½s sake, Judy, pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! Pick up the sock! (everybody scared) Iï¿½m sorry, was that rude? Di-did my, my li-little outburst blunt (?) the hideousness (?) that is this evening? Look, I know, you all have a lot going on, but all I wanted to do was have dinner with my friends on my birthday. And you are all so late and you didnï¿½t even have the courtesy to call. (her cellular rings) Well, itï¿½s too late now.

Ross: Well, ??? think thatï¿½s us?

Phoebe: well, this is, this is, this is not over! (on phone) Hello?

Joey: (to Chandler and Monica) Well, what is going on with you two?

Monica: Uch, you see, Iï¿½m ovulating.

Chandler: Oh yeah, thatï¿½s what she says. But maybe youï¿½re not ovulating at all, maybe itï¿½s just a clever ruse to get me into bed.

Monica: Yes smokie, that is what it was. I just canï¿½t get enough.

Chandler: (to Joey) You not gonna believe this: She lied! She tricked me into having sex with her.

Joey: So? Did have sex, right?

Chandler: Whatï¿½s the matter with me? Why Iï¿½m such a girl?

Phoebe: (returns) Okay, that was Mike.

Rachel: Phoebe, hi, weï¿½re so sorry. Youï¿½re totally right. We are here one hundred per cent and we love you and we are ready to start your birthday celebration.

Phoebe: Mhuh, guys, that means the world to me. Huh, nkay, Iï¿½m gonna take off.

Rachel: What?

Phoebe: Oh, I love you guys too, but Mike got off work early. Wait. Wait, Iï¿½m not tï¿½not that kind of girl that just ditches her friends to be with her boyfriend. You know what? I am. Bye guys! (waves to the bar) Judy! Bye.

Rachel: Oh thank god, if Phoebeï¿½s going, can we please take Emma home?

Ross: You know, I think thatï¿½s a good ideaï¿½our babysitter just pounded in another Chardonnet. (both get up) Bye, yï¿½guys.

Monica: Bye.

Joey: See ya. Well, this is just us.

Monica & Chandler: Mhum.

Monica: So, Iï¿½m, Iï¿½m probably still ovulating. Do you want to give it another try?

Chandler: So you never had sex with a Kennedy, have you?

Joey: Do, do you gonna do it now?

Monica: We donï¿½t have much time. Once the egg descended the oviduct ï¿½

Joey: No-ohoh. (the Bings leave, the waiter comes)

Maitre Dï¿½: I sincerely hope the rest of your party is returning.

Joey: Nah, just me. All alone. (all the food is served) Dinner for six for one, uh, you boys are about to see something really special.

Closing Credits

[Scene: continues, Joey finished everything.]

Waiter: How was everything, sir?

Joey: Excellent. The shrew in particular was exclusive.

Waiter: Well, I hope, you got some room left.

Waiters: (with birthday cake, singing) Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy birthday dear ï¿½

Joey: Joey! Joey.

Waiters: ï¿½ Joey, happy birthday to you.

Joey: Thatï¿½s the best birthday ever.

End
[Scene: Chandler's hotel room in Tulsa. He's fast asleep when the telephone rings.]

Chandler: (picking up the telephone, answering it with a frog in his throat) Hello? (he clears his throat, but he still has the same frog in his throat when he speaks again) Hello?

Monica: (in her apartment, screaming) I LOVE MY NEW JOB!

Chandler: Honey, you're screaming.

Monica: YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.

Chandler: (yawning) Oh, that's great.

Monica: Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.

Chandler: (clearly not so interested) Awesome.

Monica: Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met. (Chandler, who was almost asleep again, sits up straight in bed in an instant and can't believe what he just heard.)

OPENING CREDITS

[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe and Mike are on the couch, holding hands, while Phoebe puts milk in her coffee.]

Mike: This is nice.

Phoebe: I know! (Phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar, shakes it, and then realises she can't open it with one hand, but doesn't want to let go of Mike's hand. She tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)

Mike: You need both hands for that?

Phoebe: Yeah, I kinda do. (Mike lets go of her hand) Well, how's this? (she takes Mike's hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open the sugar and puts it in her coffee. Mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. After that, they hold hands again. Joey now enters, and sees the two sitting on the couch, holding hands.)

Joey: (in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice) Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? (Phoebe and Mike, embarrassed, start babbling and look away.) Have you not talked about it yet? (They say nothing now, but smile) Am I making you uncomfortable? (smiles are becoming forced now, and he speaks to Mike) If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar)

Phoebe: I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.

Mike: Is it?

Phoebe: (in a flash she answers) Maybe not, is it?

Mike: Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have this... (He tries to get something from his pocket, but it's not that easy... Phoebe looks in a "what's happening" face to him. He finally has found something) No, not... that's gum. (He digs in a little more.) Ooh, five bucks... I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there...

Phoebe: (impatient) I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?

Mike: Oh, sorry. (He digs in again and finally finds what he's been looking for. A key.)

Phoebe: Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.

Mike: It's to my apartment.

Phoebe: (really surprised) Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike.

Mike: Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because...

Phoebe: Oh no, I want to.

Mike: Oh, thank God. (he laughs nervously, and Phoebe gets her keychain from her bag.)

Phoebe: Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. (Both Phoebe and Mike look really proud.)

Mike: Is this cool, huh?

Phoebe: It really is.

Joey: (sitting at his table) Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh! (mimes opening a door with his own keys, Phoebe looks at him in a "yeah, yeah, yeah" way.)

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Both of them sitting on the couch, interviewing a nanny candidate.]

Rachel: So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.

Prospective nanny: (in a sweet, caring voice) I think that's really smart. The easier we can make the transition for her, the better. (Ross and Rachel seem pleased with the answer.)

Rachel: That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?

Prospective nanny: Not really.

Rachel: Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... (they're standing up and make their way to the door)

Ross: Thank you.

Rachel: Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.

Prospective nanny: Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question. (she starts playing with her hair) Do you guys do random drug testing?

Ross: Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.

Prospective nanny: That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm gonna need three days notice.

Rachel: Okidoki! (and she slams the door in the nanny's face while Ross crumples up the application form) Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.

Ross: Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews (They sit down and Rachel sighs) And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.

Rachel: (indignant) What, the blonde with no bra?

Ross: She was blonde? (he looks surprised for a while, but then gets a "gotcha" expression on his face... There's knocking at the door.) Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.

Rachel: Okay... (Ross opens the door.)

Sandy: (a guy) Hi... I'm Sandy.

Ross: And she's a little mannish...

[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. There's a knock on the door, and Phoebe opens it.]

Phoebe: (gasps) Oh my God! David!

David: Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?

Phoebe: (excited) No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?

David: Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.

Phoebe: Who cares, it got you here.

David: Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your address I... I... I didn't even think about it.

Phoebe: Wow. Where is your luggage? (David thinks for a while)

David: Damn it!

Phoebe: A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.

David: Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression, uhm... it goes: Schto ya ztez vigul... ui! Roughly translated that means uhm... This thing that I'm looking at: wow!

Phoebe: Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good.

David: Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking about: Come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful, but... well, you are. (Phoebe seems very charmed) Well, so, uhm... are you seeing... anyone? (Phoebe is still up on a cloud from what David just said)

Phoebe: No...

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica sits on the couch and Phoebe is pacing up and down the room.]

Phoebe: I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?

Monica: Maybe he didn't give you a chance.

Phoebe: He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...

Monica: Oh, well... That had been your window.

Phoebe: Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible.

Monica: Really? The scientist guy?

Phoebe: Really? Chandler?

Monica: Continue...

Phoebe: Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.

Monica: Phoebe!

Phoebe: I know! (points at herself) Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!

Monica: Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?

Phoebe: (sarcastically) Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.

Monica: What are you gonna do?

Phoebe: I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...

Monica: You have to tell David!

Phoebe: Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.

[Scene: The hallway between the two apartments. Chandler comes home.]

Chandler: (angry) Funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... (laughs about himself, but then gets determined again) Save it for inside! (he enters)

Monica: Heeeeeey!

Chandler: Hey!

Phoebe: Hey!

Chandler: So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. (Monica looks at Phoebe, who also doesn't know what to say.) And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.

Monica: (Doesn't believe what she's hearing) Was your cabin pressurised?

Chandler: (laughs, but then moves to Phoebe) And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.

Phoebe: Okay. (and she walks away)

Chandler: What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? (Monica laughs) See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?

Monica: No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?

Chandler: Yeah, he came up...

Monica: Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. (Phoebe bursts out in a laugh)

Chandler: (to Phoebe) Were you there?

Phoebe: No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. They're interviewing Sandy.]

Sandy: I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart... (Ross has got that bored/angry/skeptic look and Rachel is very emotional)

Rachel: Sandy, that's exactly what it is...

Ross: Are you gay? (Rachel turns to Ross in an embarrassed way)

Rachel: Ross!

Sandy: It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I am straight. I-I'm engaged actually.

Rachel: Oh!

Sandy: Her name is Deliah.

Rachel: Oh, that's pretty.

Ross: (skeptic) So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?

Sandy: I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child.

Ross: (on a yeah, right tone) Okay.

Sandy: Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I left, I said: I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy... (Ross and Rachel look puzzled) That was his name for me... I'll see you every day... right in... (points at his heart, but starts to cry before he can finish his sentence. Rachel tries to comfort him, but Ross has this "you've got to be kidding me" look all over him)

Ross: Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. (In the other room Emma starts to cry.)

Rachel: Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.

Sandy: Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...

Rachel: Oh, that would be great! (Sandy leaves for Emma's room) I love him, I love him, I love him...

Ross: Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!

Rachel: So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.

Ross: Because, it's weird!

Rachel: Why?

Ross: What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...

Rachel: (she's got that "yeah, try to say it" look on her face) Yes?

Ross: King?

Sandy: I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young... (it makes Rachel smile)

Rachel: (whispering and begging) Please? (Ross makes a "whatever" gesture) YES! Sandy you're hired.

Sandy: That's great! (He gets emotional again and waves his hand in front of his face in a feminine way, like trying to dry his tears) I'm sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family...

Rachel: Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.

Ross: You gotta be at least bi...

COMMERCIAL BREAK

[Scene: Joey's apartment. Joey is reading a 'Busty Ladies' magazine when Chandler enters.]

Chandler: Hey! (Joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. Chandler waits for Joey to finish.) I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.

Joey: Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.

Chandler: (Can't believe what he hears) Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.

Joey: I know, right? (Chandler has really big eyes, and nods) Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?

Chandler: Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.

Joey: Seriously? She actually said that?

Chandler: Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?

Joey: Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!

Chandler: Yeah!

Joey: Without that, you just got "lame with women".

Chandler: Ye.... (stops because he realises what Joey just said, and stares at him. At this moment Monica enters)

Monica: Hi! There you are.

Joey: (sees Monica) Fire trucks! (Chandlers eyes double in size and he turns to Monica who doesn't understand what's happening. Then he turns back to Joey, who says "you're welcome" without a sound)

[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. Phoebe just let David in who brought a bottle of wine.]

David: Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.

Phoebe: Oof...

David: In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now. (David holds Phoebe and wants to kiss her.)

Phoebe: Oh, wait, wait!

David: Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that. I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I...

Phoebe: No, no, it's not that. (they go sit on the couch) Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.

David: Oh... oh...

Phoebe: Yeah, I should have told you.

David: No... well, yeah.

Phoebe: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

David: Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well, are you happy with this guy?

Phoebe: I am happy.

David: Damn it! I-I'm sorry. I-I don't mean that. I-I want you to be happy... But only with me. No, uhm... that's not fair. Uh, who cares, leave him!. Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I should probably uhm... go...

Phoebe: Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.

David: Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?

Phoebe: Of course, yeah.(they hug and Phoebe sighs... a little after that also David sighs and makes his way to the door) You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...

David: No... no...

Phoebe: I mean... (David kisses Phoebe on the cheek, makes his way to the door and turns around again)

David: In Minsk...

Phoebe: Yeah?

David: ...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm... and one on the lips.

Phoebe: Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... (They kiss 2 on each cheek... and then they pause... David turns to the door) In New York... it's... (and then David grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... They kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Rachel and Sandy sit on the couch. Sandy holds Emma. Ross enters the apartment. Sandy and Rachel wipe their tears away with handkerchiefs]

Rachel: (in a tearful voice) Oh... Oh boy... (she turns around and sees Ross) Hi...

Ross: (very worried) Is everything allright?

Rachel: Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancÃ©e and it was just sooo beautiful.

Sandy: Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the poem...

Rachel: I can't... I can't hear it again.

Sandy: You know, I can't tell it again... (wipes his tears again)

Ross: And I'm fine never having heard it... (Rachel looks at Ross in a "why do you say that" manner) Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?

Rachel: Yeah! (to Sandy) Excuse me... (She walks to the kitchen with Ross and sighs)

Ross: Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.

Rachel: Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.

Ross: (picks up a cookie) Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive. (takes a bite from the cookie)

Rachel: What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?

Ross: (speaking with his mouth full) Yeah, I mean, all things that guy... (looks at the cookie) These are amazing!

Rachel: Sandy made Madeleines.

Ross: This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. (takes a careful bite from the cookie)

Rachel: Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.

Ross: Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.

Rachel: Okay, what? What is too sensitive? (There's music coming from the living room. Ross opens the door to the living room and he and Rachel see Sandy play a song for Emma on his recorder. Rachel is moved by this, but Ross only sees his point proven again, and walks back into the kitchen, angrily. The door he was holding, swings back and hits Rachel.)

[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. She and David are still kissing each other in the living room.]

Phoebe: Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.

David: But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.

Phoebe: No, no. No.

David: But... ergo...

Phoebe: Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...

David: Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul... ui... (David holds his hands gently on the back of Phoebe's neck. There's a sound of a a bunch of keys rattling, and the door opens... It's Mike)

Mike: Well... hey, the key works...! (he looks as if he doesn't want to believe what's happening)

Phoebe: (points to David) And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica is in the kitchen and Ross enters.]

Ross: Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?

Monica: Yeah! I think that's great!

Ross: Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?

Monica: Oh... How are they?

Ross: (looks like in heaven) Lighter than air... (changes back to serious) But that's not the point. (Joey now also enters)

Joey: Hey!

Ross: Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.

Joey: (looks surprised) Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...

Ross: Thank you!

Joey: That's like a woman wanting to be a...

Ross: ...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?

Monica: Yes... What is the end of that sentence?

Joey: Uhm... A penis model. (Monica can't believe what's she's hearing and Ross pats Joey on the back.) Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?

Monica: Yeah, so?

Ross: Wow!

Joey: Really? Do you not know Chandler?

Monica: Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...

Joey: So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is... (he can't come up with anything)

Ross: Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?

Joey: ...No... (he just can't seem to grasp it)

Monica: I can't believe he's that upset about this...

Joey: Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like... (the door opens and Chandler walks in with a pizza)

Chandler: Hey!

Joey: Heeeyy! Hey!

Chandler: What are you guys talking about?

Ross: Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny. (Joey makes a gesture and sound like "Can you believe that?")

Chandler: You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? (Monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. Joey realises they also should laugh and punches Ross. Now all three of them laugh, but very fake. Chandler seems happy again.)

Chandler: You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)

Monica: Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!

Chandler: If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)

Monica: Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it! (Monica wipes away tears)

Chandler: What is so funny about that? (they realise it wasn't a joke)

Monica: Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy! (Chandler turns to Joey)

Chandler: Did you tell her what we talked about? (Joey starts laughing hysterically, but then gets serious again...)

Joey: Yeah....

Chandler: So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? (Joey and Ross walk away from the kitchen)

Monica: Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.

Chandler: Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?

Monica: Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...

Chandler: I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.

Monica: Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? (he laughs) That slayed me.

Ross: Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you! (He points at Chandler. Joey gestures to Ross "What are you doing?)

Joey: Not knowing when to shut up...

Ross: Yep! That's my thing...

Mike: So... how many guys have your key?

Phoebe: No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.

Mike: Your lipstick's on his mouth.

David: Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.

Phoebe: No, uhm... David and I did use to go out... but years ago, and he lives in Minsk. He's only... he's only in town for a couple of days.

Mike: Don't point your finger at me.

David: Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?

Mike: Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about it... (he hits David's finger with his finger and they start to finger-fight using their fingers as swords saying all kinds of macho crap)

Phoebe: Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! (they stop and Phoebe gets David's jacket and gives it to him) Here David, you should just go.

David: Allright... But... if I ever do come back from Minsk... (points at Mike) well, you just better watch out.

Mike: Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd better watch out.

David: Oh, you're going to Minsk?

Mike: Well, I might.

Phoebe: Okay, well... guys?

David: Right... Goodbye Phoebe. (Makes a move to kiss her.)

Mike: Hey, what are you kidding me?

David: Right-o, right-o... (to Mike) Take good care of her. (and he leaves)

Phoebe: I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. If you... If you want your key back, I totally understand.

Mike: It's never gonna happen again right?

Phoebe: Right! Never! Never! I swear! (They kiss... The door opens and David comes in again.)

David: I-I... Oh I...I just wanna say uhm... if you do ever come to Minsk, that's my number (gives Mike a business card) We'll uhm... we'll party up Vladnik style. (He leaves again)

[Scene: Ross walks in the hallway to his apartment and stops in front of his own door. Now he hears two recorders playing a song. When he enters, Sandy and Joey are playing the recorder and Rachel listens.]

Joey: Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns.

Ross: Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.

Joey: Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this... (he puts his fingers in position on the recorder)

Ross: (looks angrily at Joey and points at him) I swear to God...! (Joey is in shock)

Sandy: Who's up for puppets?

Joey: Me! I'm up for puppets!

Sandy: Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus?

Ross: Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?

Sandy: Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours help their cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us. (He winks to Joey and Rachel. Ross's face says he disapproves. Joey sees that and kind of angrily says...)

Joey: I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch. (and makes a "there" nod to Ross)

Ross: (shakes his head) Oh my God!

Sandy: Well, I guess we know who's gonna be the Grumpus... (Ross goes to the kitchen)

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's kitchen. Ross got a beer from the refrigerator and opens the bottle. Rachel now also enters the kitchen.]

Rachel: That was kind of rude!

Ross: Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.

Rachel: You know, he was just doing his job...

Ross: Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this.

Rachel: Oh, come on Ross...

Ross: No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...

Rachel: (sighs) Oh... That's true.

Ross: Thank you!

Rachel: Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it. (Ross walks to the living room determined to fire Sandy)

[Scene: Living room. Joey and Sandy are talking with the Snufflebumps.]

Sandy: (In a puppet voice) So you see Wigglemunch, that's why it's important to shaaaaaaare...

Joey: (kind of emotional) I am learning so much from you.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica and Joey are sitting at the dinner table. Chandler comes from the bedroom with his suitcase.]

Chandler: Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.

Monica: Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.

Chandler: Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!

Monica: Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.

Chandler: I love you too. (Monica and Chandler kiss. He turns to Joey.) And... I like you as a friend. (They hug and pat each other on the back.)

Joey: Allright. See you later!

Chandler: See ya! (he leaves the apartment)

Joey: (to Monica) Did that guy really make that joke?

Monica: Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Sandy is knitting baby clothes. Ross and Rachel walk into the living room.]

Ross: Here goes...

Rachel: I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo. (Ross walks to the couch where Sandy sits)

Ross: Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out.

Sandy: (surprised) Oh...

Ross: Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...

Rachel: (from behind the bedroom door) YOU! You feel!

Ross: I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...

Sandy: Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.

Rachel: (from bedroom) Oh, damn you Geller!

Ross: Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.

Sandy: No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.

Ross: No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue.

Sandy: What is it...? (Ross hesitates) Please...? (he tilts his head)

Ross: You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.

Sandy: That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think that is?

Ross: Why... I... I don't know. (Sandy tilts his head again) Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?

Sandy: hmmm... (and shakes his head)

Ross: I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.

Rachel: (from the bedroom) Huh ha ha!

Ross: I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.

Sandy: That must have been hard.

Ross: It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... "What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?

Sandy: But you are a real boy!

Ross: I know I am! (Ross now starts to cry) ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?

Sandy: It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos out.

Ross: Here come some more...

COMMERCIAL BREAK

[Scene: Joey's apartment. Joey and Sandy are sitting at the kitchen counter. Joey is holding mr. Wigglemunch, and Sandy holds the Grumpus.]

Monica: (in her apartment, screaming) I LOVE MY NEW JOB!

Chandler: Honey, you're screaming.

Monica: YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.

Chandler: (yawning) Oh, that's great.

Monica: Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.

Chandler: (clearly not so interested) Awesome.

Monica: Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met. (Chandler, who was almost asleep again, sits up straight in bed in an instant and can't believe what he just heard.)

OPENING CREDITS

[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe and Mike are on the couch, holding hands, while Phoebe puts milk in her coffee.]

Mike: This is nice.

Phoebe: I know! (Phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar, shakes it, and then realises she can't open it with one hand, but doesn't want to let go of Mike's hand. She tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)

Mike: You need both hands for that?

Phoebe: Yeah, I kinda do. (Mike lets go of her hand) Well, how's this? (she takes Mike's hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open the sugar and puts it in her coffee. Mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. After that, they hold hands again. Joey now enters, and sees the two sitting on the couch, holding hands.)

Joey: (in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice) Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? (Phoebe and Mike, embarrassed, start babbling and look away.) Have you not talked about it yet? (They say nothing now, but smile) Am I making you uncomfortable? (smiles are becoming forced now, and he speaks to Mike) If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar)

Phoebe: I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.

Mike: Is it?

Phoebe: (in a flash she answers) Maybe not, is it?

Mike: Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have this... (He tries to get something from his pocket, but it's not that easy... Phoebe looks in a "what's happening" face to him. He finally has found something) No, not... that's gum. (He digs in a little more.) Ooh, five bucks... I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there...

Phoebe: (impatient) I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?

Mike: Oh, sorry. (He digs in again and finally finds what he's been looking for. A key.)

Phoebe: Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.

Mike: It's to my apartment.

Phoebe: (really surprised) Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike.

Mike: Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because...

Phoebe: Oh no, I want to.

Mike: Oh, thank God. (he laughs nervously, and Phoebe gets her keychain from her bag.)

Phoebe: Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. (Both Phoebe and Mike look really proud.)

Mike: Is this cool, huh?

Phoebe: It really is.

Joey: (sitting at his table) Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh! (mimes opening a door with his own keys, Phoebe looks at him in a "yeah, yeah, yeah" way.)

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Both of them sitting on the couch, interviewing a nanny candidate.]

Rachel: So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.

Prospective nanny: (in a sweet, caring voice) I think that's really smart. The easier we can make the transition for her, the better. (Ross and Rachel seem pleased with the answer.)

Rachel: That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?

Prospective nanny: Not really.

Rachel: Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... (they're standing up and make their way to the door)

Ross: Thank you.

Rachel: Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.

Prospective nanny: Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question. (she starts playing with her hair) Do you guys do random drug testing?

Ross: Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.

Prospective nanny: That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm gonna need three days notice.

Rachel: Okidoki! (and she slams the door in the nanny's face while Ross crumples up the application form) Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.

Ross: Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews (They sit down and Rachel sighs) And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.

Rachel: (indignant) What, the blonde with no bra?

Ross: She was blonde? (he looks surprised for a while, but then gets a "gotcha" expression on his face... There's knocking at the door.) Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.

Rachel: Okay... (Ross opens the door.)

Sandy: (a guy) Hi... I'm Sandy.

Ross: And she's a little mannish...

[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. There's a knock on the door, and Phoebe opens it.]

Phoebe: (gasps) Oh my God! David!

David: Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?

Phoebe: (excited) No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?

David: Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.

Phoebe: Who cares, it got you here.

David: Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your address I... I... I didn't even think about it.

Phoebe: Wow. Where is your luggage? (David thinks for a while)

David: Damn it!

Phoebe: A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.

David: Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression, uhm... it goes: Schto ya ztez vigul... ui! Roughly translated that means uhm... This thing that I'm looking at: wow!

Phoebe: Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good.

David: Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking about: Come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful, but... well, you are. (Phoebe seems very charmed) Well, so, uhm... are you seeing... anyone? (Phoebe is still up on a cloud from what David just said)

Phoebe: No...

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica sits on the couch and Phoebe is pacing up and down the room.]

Phoebe: I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?

Monica: Maybe he didn't give you a chance.

Phoebe: He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...

Monica: Oh, well... That had been your window.

Phoebe: Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible.

Monica: Really? The scientist guy?

Phoebe: Really? Chandler?

Monica: Continue...

Phoebe: Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.

Monica: Phoebe!

Phoebe: I know! (points at herself) Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!

Monica: Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?

Phoebe: (sarcastically) Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.

Monica: What are you gonna do?

Phoebe: I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...

Monica: You have to tell David!

Phoebe: Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.

[Scene: The hallway between the two apartments. Chandler comes home.]

Chandler: (angry) Funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... (laughs about himself, but then gets determined again) Save it for inside! (he enters)

Monica: Heeeeeey!

Chandler: Hey!

Phoebe: Hey!

Chandler: So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. (Monica looks at Phoebe, who also doesn't know what to say.) And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.

Monica: (Doesn't believe what she's hearing) Was your cabin pressurised?

Chandler: (laughs, but then moves to Phoebe) And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.

Phoebe: Okay. (and she walks away)

Chandler: What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? (Monica laughs) See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?

Monica: No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?

Chandler: Yeah, he came up...

Monica: Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. (Phoebe bursts out in a laugh)

Chandler: (to Phoebe) Were you there?

Phoebe: No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. They're interviewing Sandy.]

Sandy: I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart... (Ross has got that bored/angry/skeptic look and Rachel is very emotional)

Rachel: Sandy, that's exactly what it is...

Ross: Are you gay? (Rachel turns to Ross in an embarrassed way)

Rachel: Ross!

Sandy: It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I am straight. I-I'm engaged actually.

Rachel: Oh!

Sandy: Her name is Deliah.

Rachel: Oh, that's pretty.

Ross: (skeptic) So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?

Sandy: I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child.

Ross: (on a yeah, right tone) Okay.

Sandy: Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I left, I said: I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy... (Ross and Rachel look puzzled) That was his name for me... I'll see you every day... right in... (points at his heart, but starts to cry before he can finish his sentence. Rachel tries to comfort him, but Ross has this "you've got to be kidding me" look all over him)

Ross: Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. (In the other room Emma starts to cry.)

Rachel: Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.

Sandy: Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...

Rachel: Oh, that would be great! (Sandy leaves for Emma's room) I love him, I love him, I love him...

Ross: Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!

Rachel: So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.

Ross: Because, it's weird!

Rachel: Why?

Ross: What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...

Rachel: (she's got that "yeah, try to say it" look on her face) Yes?

Ross: King?

Sandy: I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young... (it makes Rachel smile)

Rachel: (whispering and begging) Please? (Ross makes a "whatever" gesture) YES! Sandy you're hired.

Sandy: That's great! (He gets emotional again and waves his hand in front of his face in a feminine way, like trying to dry his tears) I'm sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family...

Rachel: Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.

Ross: You gotta be at least bi...

COMMERCIAL BREAK

[Scene: Joey's apartment. Joey is reading a 'Busty Ladies' magazine when Chandler enters.]

Chandler: Hey! (Joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. Chandler waits for Joey to finish.) I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.

Joey: Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.

Chandler: (Can't believe what he hears) Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.

Joey: I know, right? (Chandler has really big eyes, and nods) Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?

Chandler: Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.

Joey: Seriously? She actually said that?

Chandler: Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?

Joey: Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!

Chandler: Yeah!

Joey: Without that, you just got "lame with women".

Chandler: Ye.... (stops because he realises what Joey just said, and stares at him. At this moment Monica enters)

Monica: Hi! There you are.

Joey: (sees Monica) Fire trucks! (Chandlers eyes double in size and he turns to Monica who doesn't understand what's happening. Then he turns back to Joey, who says "you're welcome" without a sound)

[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. Phoebe just let David in who brought a bottle of wine.]

David: Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.

Phoebe: Oh, wait, wait!

David: Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that. I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I...

Phoebe: No, no, it's not that. (they go sit on the couch) Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.

David: Oh... oh...

Phoebe: Yeah, I should have told you.

David: No... well, yeah.

Phoebe: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

David: Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well, are you happy with this guy?

Phoebe: I am happy.

David: Damn it! I-I'm sorry. I-I don't mean that. I-I want you to be happy... But only with me. No, uhm... that's not fair. Uh, who cares, leave him!. Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I should probably uhm... go...

Phoebe: Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.

David: Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?

Phoebe: Of course, yeah.(they hug and Phoebe sighs... a little after that also David sighs and makes his way to the door) You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...

David: No... no...

Phoebe: I mean... (David kisses Phoebe on the cheek, makes his way to the door and turns around again)

David: In Minsk...

Phoebe: Yeah?

David: ...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm... and one on the lips.

Phoebe: Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... (They kiss 2 on each cheek... and then they pause... David turns to the door) In New York... it's... (and then David grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... They kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Rachel and Sandy sit on the couch. Sandy holds Emma. Ross enters the apartment. Sandy and Rachel wipe their tears away with handkerchiefs]

Rachel: (in a tearful voice) Oh... Oh boy... (she turns around and sees Ross) Hi...

Ross: (very worried) Is everything allright?

Rachel: Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancÃ©e and it was just sooo beautiful.

Sandy: Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the poem...

Rachel: I can't... I can't hear it again.

Sandy: You know, I can't tell it again... (wipes his tears again)

Ross: And I'm fine never having heard it... (Rachel looks at Ross in a "why do you say that" manner) Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?

Rachel: Yeah! (to Sandy) Excuse me... (She walks to the kitchen with Ross and sighs)

Ross: Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.

Rachel: Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.

Ross: (picks up a cookie) Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive. (takes a bite from the cookie)

Rachel: What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?

Ross: (speaking with his mouth full) Yeah, I mean, all things that guy... (looks at the cookie) These are amazing!

Rachel: Sandy made Madeleines.

Ross: This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. (takes a careful bite from the cookie)

Rachel: Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.

Ross: Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.

Rachel: Okay, what? What is too sensitive? (There's music coming from the living room. Ross opens the door to the living room and he and Rachel see Sandy play a song for Emma on his recorder. Rachel is moved by this, but Ross only sees his point proven again, and walks back into the kitchen, angrily. The door he was holding, swings back and hits Rachel.)

[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. She and David are still kissing each other in the living room.]

Phoebe: Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.

David: But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.

Phoebe: No, no. No.

David: But... ergo...

Phoebe: Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...

David: Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul... ui... (David holds his hands gently on the back of Phoebe's neck. There's a sound of a a bunch of keys rattling, and the door opens... It's Mike)

Mike: Well... hey, the key works...! (he looks as if he doesn't want to believe what's happening)

Phoebe: (points to David) And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica is in the kitchen and Ross enters.]

Ross: Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?

Monica: Yeah! I think that's great!

Ross: Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?

Monica: Oh... How are they?

Ross: (looks like in heaven) Lighter than air... (changes back to serious) But that's not the point. (Joey now also enters)

Joey: Hey!

Ross: Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.

Joey: (looks surprised) Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...

Ross: Thank you!

Joey: That's like a woman wanting to be a...

Ross: ...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?

Monica: Yes... What is the end of that sentence?

Joey: Uhm... A penis model. (Monica can't believe what's she's hearing and Ross pats Joey on the back.) Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?

Monica: Yeah, so?

Ross: Wow!

Joey: Really? Do you not know Chandler?

Monica: Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...

Joey: So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is... (he can't come up with anything)

Ross: Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?

Joey: ...No... (he just can't seem to grasp it)

Monica: I can't believe he's that upset about this...

Joey: Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like... (the door opens and Chandler walks in with a pizza)

Chandler: Hey!

Joey: Heeeyy! Hey!

Chandler: What are you guys talking about?

Ross: Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny. (Joey makes a gesture and sound like "Can you believe that?")

Chandler: You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? (Monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. Joey realises they also should laugh and punches Ross. Now all three of them laugh, but very fake. Chandler seems happy again.)

Chandler: You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)

Monica: Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!

Chandler: If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)

Monica: Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it! (Monica wipes away tears)

Chandler: What is so funny about that? (they realise it wasn't a joke)

Monica: Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy! (Chandler turns to Joey)

Chandler: Did you tell her what we talked about? (Joey starts laughing hysterically, but then gets serious again...)

Joey: Yeah....

Chandler: So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? (Joey and Ross walk away from the kitchen)

Monica: Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.

Chandler: Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?

Monica: Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...

Chandler: I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.

Monica: Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? (he laughs) That slayed me.

Ross: Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you! (He points at Chandler. Joey gestures to Ross "What are you doing?)

Joey: Not knowing when to shut up...

Ross: Yep! That's my thing...

Mike: Don't point your finger at me.

David: Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?

Mike: Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about it... (he hits David's finger with his finger and they start to finger-fight using their fingers as swords saying all kinds of macho crap)

Phoebe: Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! (they stop and Phoebe gets David's jacket and gives it to him) Here David, you should just go.

David: Allright... But... if I ever do come back from Minsk... (points at Mike) well, you just better watch out.

Mike: Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd better watch out.

Joey: Me! I'm up for puppets!

Sandy: Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus?

Ross: Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?

Sandy: Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours help their cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us. (He winks to Joey and Rachel. Ross's face says he disapproves. Joey sees that and kind of angrily says...)

Joey: I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch. (and makes a "there" nod to Ross)

Monica: Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.

Chandler: Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!

Monica: Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.

Rachel: (from behind the bedroom door) YOU! You feel!

Ross: I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...

Sandy: Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.

Rachel: (from bedroom) Oh, damn you Geller!

Ross: Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.

Sandy: No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.

Ross: No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue.

Sandy: What is it...? (Ross hesitates) Please...? (he tilts his head)

Ross: You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.

Sandy: That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think that is?

Ross: Why... I... I don't know. (Sandy tilts his head again) Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?

Sandy: hmmm... (and shakes his head)

Ross: I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.

Rachel: (from the bedroom) Huh ha ha!

Ross: I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.

Sandy: That must have been hard.

Ross: It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... "What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?

Sandy: But you are a real boy!

Ross: I know I am! (Ross now starts to cry) ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?

OPENING CREDITS

[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe and Mike are on the couch, holding hands, while Phoebe puts milk in her coffee.]

Mike: This is nice.

Phoebe: I know! (Phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar, shakes it, and then realises she can't open it with one hand, but doesn't want to let go of Mike's hand. She tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)

Mike: You need both hands for that?

Phoebe: Yeah, I kinda do. (Mike lets go of her hand) Well, how's this? (she takes Mike's hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open the sugar and puts it in her coffee. Mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. After that, they hold hands again. Joey now enters, and sees the two sitting on the couch, holding hands.)

Joey: (in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice) Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? (Phoebe and Mike, embarrassed, start babbling and look away.) Have you not talked about it yet? (They say nothing now, but smile) Am I making you uncomfortable? (smiles are becoming forced now, and he speaks to Mike) If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar)

Phoebe: I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.

Mike: Is it?

Phoebe: (in a flash she answers) Maybe not, is it?

Mike: Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have this... (He tries to get something from his pocket, but it's not that easy... Phoebe looks in a "what's happening" face to him. He finally has found something) No, not... that's gum. (He digs in a little more.) Ooh, five bucks... I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there...

Phoebe: (impatient) I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?

Mike: Oh, sorry. (He digs in again and finally finds what he's been looking for. A key.)

Phoebe: Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.

Mike: It's to my apartment.

Phoebe: (really surprised) Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike.

Mike: Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because...

Phoebe: Oh no, I want to.

Mike: Oh, thank God. (he laughs nervously, and Phoebe gets her keychain from her bag.)

Phoebe: Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. (Both Phoebe and Mike look really proud.)

Mike: Is this cool, huh?

Phoebe: It really is.

Joey: (sitting at his table) Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh! (mimes opening a door with his own keys, Phoebe looks at him in a "yeah, yeah, yeah" way.)

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Both of them sitting on the couch, interviewing a nanny candidate.]

Rachel: So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.

Prospective nanny: (in a sweet, caring voice) I think that's really smart. The easier we can make the transition for her, the better. (Ross and Rachel seem pleased with the answer.)

Rachel: That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?

Prospective nanny: Not really.

Rachel: Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... (they're standing up and make their way to the door)

Ross: Thank you.

Rachel: Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.

Prospective nanny: Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question. (she starts playing with her hair) Do you guys do random drug testing?

Ross: Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.

Prospective nanny: That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm gonna need three days notice.

Rachel: Okidoki! (and she slams the door in the nanny's face while Ross crumples up the application form) Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.

Ross: Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews (They sit down and Rachel sighs) And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.

Rachel: (indignant) What, the blonde with no bra?

Ross: She was blonde? (he looks surprised for a while, but then gets a "gotcha" expression on his face... There's knocking at the door.) Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.

Rachel: Okay... (Ross opens the door.)

Sandy: (a guy) Hi... I'm Sandy.

Ross: And she's a little mannish...

[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. There's a knock on the door, and Phoebe opens it.]

Phoebe: (gasps) Oh my God! David!

David: Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?

Phoebe: (excited) No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?

David: Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.

Phoebe: Who cares, it got you here.

David: Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your address I... I... I didn't even think about it.

Phoebe: Wow. Where is your luggage? (David thinks for a while)

David: Damn it!

Phoebe: A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.

David: Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression, uhm... it goes: Schto ya ztez vigul... ui! Roughly translated that means uhm... This thing that I'm looking at: wow!

Phoebe: Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good.

David: Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking about: Come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful, but... well, you are. (Phoebe seems very charmed) Well, so, uhm... are you seeing... anyone? (Phoebe is still up on a cloud from what David just said)

Phoebe: No...

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica sits on the couch and Phoebe is pacing up and down the room.]

Phoebe: I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?

Monica: Maybe he didn't give you a chance.

Phoebe: He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...

Monica: Oh, well... That had been your window.

Phoebe: Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible.

Monica: Really? The scientist guy?

Phoebe: Really? Chandler?

Monica: Continue...

Phoebe: Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.

Monica: Phoebe!

Phoebe: I know! (points at herself) Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!

Monica: Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?

Phoebe: (sarcastically) Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.

Monica: What are you gonna do?

Phoebe: I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...

Monica: You have to tell David!

Phoebe: Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.

[Scene: The hallway between the two apartments. Chandler comes home.]

Chandler: (angry) Funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... (laughs about himself, but then gets determined again) Save it for inside! (he enters)

Monica: Heeeeeey!

Chandler: Hey!

Phoebe: Hey!

Chandler: So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. (Monica looks at Phoebe, who also doesn't know what to say.) And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.

Monica: (Doesn't believe what she's hearing) Was your cabin pressurised?

Chandler: (laughs, but then moves to Phoebe) And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.

Phoebe: Okay. (and she walks away)

Chandler: What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? (Monica laughs) See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?

Monica: No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?

Chandler: Yeah, he came up...

Monica: Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. (Phoebe bursts out in a laugh)

Chandler: (to Phoebe) Were you there?

Phoebe: No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. They're interviewing Sandy.]

Sandy: I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart... (Ross has got that bored/angry/skeptic look and Rachel is very emotional)

Rachel: Sandy, that's exactly what it is...

Ross: Are you gay? (Rachel turns to Ross in an embarrassed way)

Rachel: Ross!

Sandy: It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I am straight. I-I'm engaged actually.

Rachel: Oh!

Sandy: Her name is Deliah.

Rachel: Oh, that's pretty.

Ross: (skeptic) So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?

Sandy: I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child.

Ross: (on a yeah, right tone) Okay.

Sandy: Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I left, I said: I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy... (Ross and Rachel look puzzled) That was his name for me... I'll see you every day... right in... (points at his heart, but starts to cry before he can finish his sentence. Rachel tries to comfort him, but Ross has this "you've got to be kidding me" look all over him)

Ross: Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. (In the other room Emma starts to cry.)

Rachel: Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.

Sandy: Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...

Rachel: Oh, that would be great! (Sandy leaves for Emma's room) I love him, I love him, I love him...

Ross: Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!

Rachel: So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.

Ross: Because, it's weird!

Rachel: Why?

Ross: What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...

Rachel: (she's got that "yeah, try to say it" look on her face) Yes?

Ross: King?

Sandy: I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young... (it makes Rachel smile)

Rachel: (whispering and begging) Please? (Ross makes a "whatever" gesture) YES! Sandy you're hired.

Sandy: That's great! (He gets emotional again and waves his hand in front of his face in a feminine way, like trying to dry his tears) I'm sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family...

Rachel: Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.

Ross: You gotta be at least bi...

COMMERCIAL BREAK

[Scene: Joey's apartment. Joey is reading a 'Busty Ladies' magazine when Chandler enters.]

Chandler: Hey! (Joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. Chandler waits for Joey to finish.) I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.

Joey: Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.

Chandler: (Can't believe what he hears) Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.

Joey: I know, right? (Chandler has really big eyes, and nods) Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?

Chandler: Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.

Joey: Seriously? She actually said that?

Chandler: Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?

Joey: Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!

Chandler: Yeah!

Joey: Without that, you just got "lame with women".

Chandler: Ye.... (stops because he realises what Joey just said, and stares at him. At this moment Monica enters)

Monica: Hi! There you are.

Joey: (sees Monica) Fire trucks! (Chandlers eyes double in size and he turns to Monica who doesn't understand what's happening. Then he turns back to Joey, who says "you're welcome" without a sound)

[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. Phoebe just let David in who brought a bottle of wine.]

David: Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.

Phoebe: Oof...

David: In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now. (David holds Phoebe and wants to kiss her.)

Phoebe: Oh, wait, wait!

David: Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that. I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I...

Phoebe: No, no, it's not that. (they go sit on the couch) Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.

David: Oh... oh...

Phoebe: Yeah, I should have told you.

David: No... well, yeah.

Phoebe: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

David: Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well, are you happy with this guy?

Phoebe: I am happy.

David: Damn it! I-I'm sorry. I-I don't mean that. I-I want you to be happy... But only with me. No, uhm... that's not fair. Uh, who cares, leave him!. Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I should probably uhm... go...

Phoebe: Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.

David: Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?

Phoebe: Of course, yeah.(they hug and Phoebe sighs... a little after that also David sighs and makes his way to the door) You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...

David: No... no...

Phoebe: I mean... (David kisses Phoebe on the cheek, makes his way to the door and turns around again)

David: In Minsk...

Phoebe: Yeah?

David: ...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm... and one on the lips.

Phoebe: Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... (They kiss 2 on each cheek... and then they pause... David turns to the door) In New York... it's... (and then David grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... They kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Rachel and Sandy sit on the couch. Sandy holds Emma. Ross enters the apartment. Sandy and Rachel wipe their tears away with handkerchiefs]

Rachel: (in a tearful voice) Oh... Oh boy... (she turns around and sees Ross) Hi...

Ross: (very worried) Is everything allright?

Rachel: Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancÃ©e and it was just sooo beautiful.

Sandy: Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the poem...

Rachel: I can't... I can't hear it again.

Sandy: You know, I can't tell it again... (wipes his tears again)

Ross: And I'm fine never having heard it... (Rachel looks at Ross in a "why do you say that" manner) Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?

Rachel: Yeah! (to Sandy) Excuse me... (She walks to the kitchen with Ross and sighs)

Ross: Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.

Rachel: Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.

Ross: (picks up a cookie) Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive. (takes a bite from the cookie)

Rachel: What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?

Ross: (speaking with his mouth full) Yeah, I mean, all things that guy... (looks at the cookie) These are amazing!

Rachel: Sandy made Madeleines.

Ross: This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. (takes a careful bite from the cookie)

Rachel: Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.

Ross: Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.

Rachel: Okay, what? What is too sensitive? (There's music coming from the living room. Ross opens the door to the living room and he and Rachel see Sandy play a song for Emma on his recorder. Rachel is moved by this, but Ross only sees his point proven again, and walks back into the kitchen, angrily. The door he was holding, swings back and hits Rachel.)

[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. She and David are still kissing each other in the living room.]

Phoebe: Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.

David: But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.

Phoebe: No, no. No.

David: But... ergo...

Phoebe: Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...

David: Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul... ui... (David holds his hands gently on the back of Phoebe's neck. There's a sound of a a bunch of keys rattling, and the door opens... It's Mike)

Mike: Well... hey, the key works...! (he looks as if he doesn't want to believe what's happening)

Phoebe: (points to David) And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica is in the kitchen and Ross enters.]

Ross: Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?

Monica: Yeah! I think that's great!

Ross: Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?

Monica: Oh... How are they?

Ross: (looks like in heaven) Lighter than air... (changes back to serious) But that's not the point. (Joey now also enters)

Joey: Hey!

Ross: Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.

Joey: (looks surprised) Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...

Ross: Thank you!

Joey: That's like a woman wanting to be a...

Ross: ...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?

Monica: Yes... What is the end of that sentence?

Joey: Uhm... A penis model. (Monica can't believe what's she's hearing and Ross pats Joey on the back.) Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?

Monica: Yeah, so?

Ross: Wow!

Joey: Really? Do you not know Chandler?

Monica: Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...

Joey: So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is... (he can't come up with anything)

Ross: Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?

Joey: ...No... (he just can't seem to grasp it)

Monica: I can't believe he's that upset about this...

Joey: Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like... (the door opens and Chandler walks in with a pizza)

Chandler: Hey!

Joey: Heeeyy! Hey!

Chandler: What are you guys talking about?

Ross: Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny. (Joey makes a gesture and sound like "Can you believe that?")

Chandler: You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? (Monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. Joey realises they also should laugh and punches Ross. Now all three of them laugh, but very fake. Chandler seems happy again.)

Chandler: You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)

Monica: Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!

Chandler: If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)

Monica: Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it! (Monica wipes away tears)

Chandler: What is so funny about that? (they realise it wasn't a joke)

Monica: Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy! (Chandler turns to Joey)

Chandler: Did you tell her what we talked about? (Joey starts laughing hysterically, but then gets serious again...)

Joey: Yeah....

Chandler: So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? (Joey and Ross walk away from the kitchen)

Monica: Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.

Chandler: Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?

Monica: Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...

Chandler: I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.

Monica: Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? (he laughs) That slayed me.

Ross: Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you! (He points at Chandler. Joey gestures to Ross "What are you doing?)

Joey: Not knowing when to shut up...

Ross: Yep! That's my thing...

Mike: So... how many guys have your key?

Phoebe: No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.

David: Why? Wh-What are you going to do about it?

Mike: Well... I'll... just show you what I'm gonna do about it... (he hits David's finger with his finger and they start to finger-fight using their fingers as swords saying all kinds of macho crap)

Phoebe: Stop it! Stop it, before someone gets really hurt! (they stop and Phoebe gets David's jacket and gives it to him) Here David, you should just go.

David: Allright... But... if I ever do come back from Minsk... (points at Mike) well, you just better watch out.

Mike: Well, if I ever goto Minsk, you'd better watch out.

Sandy: Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus?

Ross: Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?

Sandy: Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours help their cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us. (He winks to Joey and Rachel. Ross's face says he disapproves. Joey sees that and kind of angrily says...)

Joey: I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch. (and makes a "there" nod to Ross)

Chandler: Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.

Monica: Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.

Chandler: Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!

Monica: Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.

Chandler: I love you too. (Monica and Chandler kiss. He turns to Joey.) And... I like you as a friend. (They hug and pat each other on the back.)

Sandy: (surprised) Oh...

Ross: Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...

Rachel: (from behind the bedroom door) YOU! You feel!

Ross: I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...

Sandy: Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.

Rachel: (from bedroom) Oh, damn you Geller!

Ross: Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.

Sandy: No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.

Ross: No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue.

Sandy: What is it...? (Ross hesitates) Please...? (he tilts his head)

Ross: You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.

Sandy: That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think that is?

Ross: Why... I... I don't know. (Sandy tilts his head again) Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?

Sandy: hmmm... (and shakes his head)

Ross: I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.

Rachel: (from the bedroom) Huh ha ha!

Ross: I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.

Sandy: That must have been hard.

Ross: It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... "What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?

Sandy: But you are a real boy!

Ross: I know I am! (Ross now starts to cry) ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?

Sandy: It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos out.

Ross: Here come some more...

COMMERCIAL BREAK

[Scene: Joey's apartment. Joey and Sandy are sitting at the kitchen counter. Joey is holding mr. Wigglemunch, and Sandy holds the Grumpus.]

Sandy/Grumpus: And what's the one kind of boat that can never, ever sink?

Joey/Wigglemunch: What kind?

Sandy/Grumpus: A friend-ship...

Joey: Wow! You blow my mind...

Sandy: Oh, I gotta go.

Joey: Aaahh... How much do I owe you?

Sandy: Twenty bucks.

Joey: It's like the cheapest college ever.

END
[Scene: Chandler's hotel room in Tulsa. He's fast asleep when the telephone rings.]

Chandler: (picking up the telephone, answering it with a frog in his throat) Hello? (he clears his throat, but he still has the same frog in his throat when he speaks again) Hello?

Monica: (in her apartment, screaming) I LOVE MY NEW JOB!

Chandler: Honey, you're screaming.

Monica: YOU BET YOUR ASS I AM! I just had the best first day ever! The kitchen: twice as big as Allessandro's.

Chandler: (yawning) Oh, that's great.

Monica: Yeah, a-a-and clean. Not just health department clean... Monica clean.

Chandler: (clearly not so interested) Awesome.

Monica: Oh, and the people are so nice. There's this one guy, Geoffrey, he's the Maitre D., Chandler, you will love him. He is without a doubt, the funniest guy I have ever met. (Chandler, who was almost asleep again, sits up straight in bed in an instant and can't believe what he just heard.)

OPENING CREDITS

[Scene: Central Perk. Phoebe and Mike are on the couch, holding hands, while Phoebe puts milk in her coffee.]

Mike: This is nice.

Phoebe: I know! (Phoebe picks up a little packet of sugar, shakes it, and then realises she can't open it with one hand, but doesn't want to let go of Mike's hand. She tries to tear open the packet with one hand.)

Mike: You need both hands for that?

Phoebe: Yeah, I kinda do. (Mike lets go of her hand) Well, how's this? (she takes Mike's hand and puts it on her breast, she tears open the sugar and puts it in her coffee. Mike thinks it over and nods appreciative. After that, they hold hands again. Joey now enters, and sees the two sitting on the couch, holding hands.)

Joey: (in a very aaaaahhhhh sweeeeeet voice) Aaahhh, look at you two... holding hands... huh is this getting serious? (Phoebe and Mike, embarrassed, start babbling and look away.) Have you not talked about it yet? (They say nothing now, but smile) Am I making you uncomfortable? (smiles are becoming forced now, and he speaks to Mike) If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh...? Aaaaaahhhhhh (he turns away to the bar)

Phoebe: I'm sorry... I'm sorry. It's obviously way too early for us to be... having that conversation.

Mike: Is it?

Phoebe: (in a flash she answers) Maybe not, is it?

Mike: Okay, when I got divorced, I didn't think I'd feel this way about someone for a really long time... Then again, I didn't think I'd meet someone like you... and... this may be crazy soon, but... I want you to have this... (He tries to get something from his pocket, but it's not that easy... Phoebe looks in a "what's happening" face to him. He finally has found something) No, not... that's gum. (He digs in a little more.) Ooh, five bucks... I love it when that happens, you know... Think no note's there...

Phoebe: (impatient) I know Mike, why don't you keep digging?

Mike: Oh, sorry. (He digs in again and finally finds what he's been looking for. A key.)

Phoebe: Oh, it's a key. To be honest, I think I'd prefer the five dollars.

Mike: It's to my apartment.

Phoebe: (really surprised) Oh wow, ooh! Ooh, big step for Phoebe and Mike.

Mike: Yeah, look, and I don't want you to feel like you have to give me your key just because...

Phoebe: Oh no, I want to.

Mike: Oh, thank God. (he laughs nervously, and Phoebe gets her keychain from her bag.)

Phoebe: Yeah... ooh... wow... Even started to think I'd never meet someone that, you know, I wanted to... do this with. Here you go. (Both Phoebe and Mike look really proud.)

Mike: Is this cool, huh?

Phoebe: It really is.

Joey: (sitting at his table) Oh, I know it... It is amazing these little things open doors... huh! (mimes opening a door with his own keys, Phoebe looks at him in a "yeah, yeah, yeah" way.)

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Both of them sitting on the couch, interviewing a nanny candidate.]

Rachel: So I don't go back to work for another four weeks, but we would like our nanny to start right away, so that Emma could get a chance to know her.

Prospective nanny: (in a sweet, caring voice) I think that's really smart. The easier we can make the transition for her, the better. (Ross and Rachel seem pleased with the answer.)

Rachel: That's great, great. So do you have any questions for us?

Prospective nanny: Not really.

Rachel: Allright. Well thank you so much for coming... (they're standing up and make their way to the door)

Ross: Thank you.

Rachel: Really nice to meet you... and we'll call you.

Prospective nanny: Oh, you know, wait. I do have one question. (she starts playing with her hair) Do you guys do random drug testing?

Ross: Boy, we uhm... hadn't really thought of that.

Prospective nanny: That's cool. But... but if you do, I'm gonna need three days notice.

Rachel: Okidoki! (and she slams the door in the nanny's face while Ross crumples up the application form) Wow! We're never gonna find a nanny.

Ross: Oh, come on Rach, we will. I promise. We have more interviews (They sit down and Rachel sighs) And worse comes to worse, we can always reconsider the uhm... the first one we met with.

Rachel: (indignant) What, the blonde with no bra?

Ross: She was blonde? (he looks surprised for a while, but then gets a "gotcha" expression on his face... There's knocking at the door.) Just a sec.! Okay, okay. This one's name is Sandy. She's got a degree in early childhood education, uhm... she worked for her last family for three years.

Rachel: Okay... (Ross opens the door.)

Sandy: (a guy) Hi... I'm Sandy.

Ross: And she's a little mannish...

[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. There's a knock on the door, and Phoebe opens it.]

Phoebe: (gasps) Oh my God! David!

David: Hi! I-i-is this a bad time?

Phoebe: (excited) No! It's a great time, come in...! WOW, hi... Oh my gosh! What are you doing here? Are you back from Minsk?

David: Well, just for a couple of days, uhm... I'm here to explain to the people who gave us our grant, why it's a positive thing that we spent all their money and uhm... accomplished uhm... nothing.

Phoebe: Who cares, it got you here.

David: Well, it got me to New York anyway, and then I got on a cab at the airport, and the guy said where to? and I just... gave him your address I... I... I didn't even think about it.

Phoebe: Wow. Where is your luggage? (David thinks for a while)

David: Damn it!

Phoebe: A-Allright, well... I'll call the cab company.

David: Wa... wa... wait! We can... call them later. Can you just... just stand there f-f-for a moment? Boy! There's an old Russian expression, uhm... it goes: Schto ya ztez vigul... ui! Roughly translated that means uhm... This thing that I'm looking at: wow!

Phoebe: Thank you! God, no! You should see me when... Oh actually, no, I look pretty good.

David: Are... are you kidding? You know, when you don't see someone for a long time, a-a-and you kind of build them up in your head and you start thinking about: Come on, don't be crazy. Nobody is that beautiful, but... well, you are. (Phoebe seems very charmed) Well, so, uhm... are you seeing... anyone? (Phoebe is still up on a cloud from what David just said)

Phoebe: No...

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica sits on the couch and Phoebe is pacing up and down the room.]

Phoebe: I'm... I'm just... I'm the worst person ever. How can I not tell David that I'm seeing Mike?

Monica: Maybe he didn't give you a chance.

Phoebe: He said: Are you seeing someone? And I said no...

Monica: Oh, well... That had been your window.

Phoebe: Yeah! I mean, I don't know. I was just , I was looking, I was looking in his eyes and I was just thinking: Oh my God! It's David. David's here. He's just, he's so irresistible.

Monica: Really? The scientist guy?

Phoebe: Really? Chandler?

Monica: Continue...

Phoebe: Oh.Okay, then it gets worse, 'cause then I told him that I would see him tomorrow night.

Monica: Phoebe!

Phoebe: I know! (points at herself) Evil! And... and... and... I like Mike so much, you know. It's just going really well. Oh my God!

Monica: Wow, isn't it ironic that David would show up on the same day that you and Mike exchange keys?

Phoebe: (sarcastically) Uhuh... Yeah...!, you know. And given my life long search for irony, you can imagine how happy I am.

Monica: What are you gonna do?

Phoebe: I mean I guess, I just have to... tell David that nothing can happen between us. Unless I don't... You know, complicated moral situation, no right, no wrong...

Monica: You have to tell David!

Phoebe: Okay, I knew I should have had this conversation with Joey.

[Scene: The hallway between the two apartments. Chandler comes home.]

Chandler: (angry) Funniest guy she's ever met! (to the door) I'm funny, right...? What do you know, you're a door... You just like knock-knock jokes... (laughs about himself, but then gets determined again) Save it for inside! (he enters)

Monica: Heeeeeey!

Chandler: Hey!

Phoebe: Hey!

Chandler: So... Oklahoma is a crazy place. You know, they call it the Sooner state. Frankly I'd sooner be in any other state. (Monica looks at Phoebe, who also doesn't know what to say.) And what's with Oklahoma having a pan handle? Can all states have stuff like that? Hey yeah, I'm from the waistband, Wyoming. But when I was seven, we headed over to the crotch.

Monica: (Doesn't believe what she's hearing) Was your cabin pressurised?

Chandler: (laughs, but then moves to Phoebe) And don't get me started on the way that people from Tulsa talk.

Phoebe: Okay. (and she walks away)

Chandler: What's with the word y'all? You know, just... two words just... pushed together... Are we all allowed to do that, because if so, I say why stop there? You know, your new poodle could be your noodle. And fried chicken? Could be fricken.Waiter, waiter excuse me, I'll have the fricken? (Monica laughs) See, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?

Monica: No, it just remind me of something this guy did today at work. I told you about that funny guy, Geoffrey, right?

Chandler: Yeah, he came up...

Monica: Well, he did this bit... You probably had to be there, but it was Liza Minelli locked in our freezer, eating a raw chicken. (Phoebe bursts out in a laugh)

Chandler: (to Phoebe) Were you there?

Phoebe: No, but it sounds like it was fricken funny...

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. They're interviewing Sandy.]

Sandy: I really do understand how hard it's gotta be to leave your child with another person. I mean, it's leaving behind a piece of your heart... (Ross has got that bored/angry/skeptic look and Rachel is very emotional)

Rachel: Sandy, that's exactly what it is...

Ross: Are you gay? (Rachel turns to Ross in an embarrassed way)

Rachel: Ross!

Sandy: It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do. But I am straight. I-I'm engaged actually.

Rachel: Oh!

Sandy: Her name is Deliah.

Rachel: Oh, that's pretty.

Ross: (skeptic) So you're just like a... guy who's a nanny?

Sandy: I realise how it's... a bit unorthodox for some people, but I really believe, the most satisfying thing you can do with your life, is take care of a child.

Ross: (on a yeah, right tone) Okay.

Sandy: Like in my last job, I met Daniel when he was three weeks old. And I got to watch him grow into this awesome person... When I left, I said: I'll see you soon... And he said to me: Skdandy... (Ross and Rachel look puzzled) That was his name for me... I'll see you every day... right in... (points at his heart, but starts to cry before he can finish his sentence. Rachel tries to comfort him, but Ross has this "you've got to be kidding me" look all over him)

Ross: Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap. (In the other room Emma starts to cry.)

Rachel: Oh God, she mu... she must need her diaper changed.

Sandy: Oh, oh, I can do it for her, if you want...

Rachel: Oh, that would be great! (Sandy leaves for Emma's room) I love him, I love him, I love him...

Ross: Oh, come on, Rach, he's a guy!

Rachel: So wh..? He's smart, he's qualified. Give me one good reason we shouldn't try him out.

Ross: Because, it's weird!

Rachel: Why?

Ross: What kind of job is that for a man? A nanny? I-It's like if a woman wanted to be...

Rachel: (she's got that "yeah, try to say it" look on her face) Yes?

Ross: King?

Sandy: I er... I hope you don't mind. I used some of my home-made lotion on Emma. It's a mixture of calendula and honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up. Plus... It keeps the hands young... (it makes Rachel smile)

Rachel: (whispering and begging) Please? (Ross makes a "whatever" gesture) YES! Sandy you're hired.

Sandy: That's great! (He gets emotional again and waves his hand in front of his face in a feminine way, like trying to dry his tears) I'm sorry. It's just... such an emotional thing when you're welcomed into a new family...

Rachel: Oooh... ***I really can't hear what she says*** come here.

Ross: You gotta be at least bi...

COMMERCIAL BREAK

[Scene: Joey's apartment. Joey is reading a 'Busty Ladies' magazine when Chandler enters.]

Chandler: Hey! (Joey doesn't look up, but gestures 'wait a minute' with his finger while he finishes reading the article. Chandler waits for Joey to finish.) I need you to set me up for a joke. Later, when Monica is around, I need you to ask me about fire trucks.

Joey: Ooh. I-I don't know Chan. I'm not so good with remembering lines.

Chandler: (Can't believe what he hears) Well, thank God your livelihood doesn't depend on it.

Joey: I know, right? (Chandler has really big eyes, and nods) Wh... Wh... Why are we doing this?

Chandler: Monica says that her Maitre D. is the funniest guy she's ever met.

Joey: Seriously? She actually said that?

Chandler: Yes! Am I crazy to be this upset?

Joey: Nooooo! Being funny is your thing!

Chandler: Yeah!

Joey: Without that, you just got "lame with women".

Chandler: Ye.... (stops because he realises what Joey just said, and stares at him. At this moment Monica enters)

Monica: Hi! There you are.

Joey: (sees Monica) Fire trucks! (Chandlers eyes double in size and he turns to Monica who doesn't understand what's happening. Then he turns back to Joey, who says "you're welcome" without a sound)

[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. Phoebe just let David in who brought a bottle of wine.]

David: Wow, you look even... more beautiful than you did yesterday.

Phoebe: Oof...

David: In fact, ehm... I going to kiss you now. (David holds Phoebe and wants to kiss her.)

Phoebe: Oh, wait, wait!

David: Yeah, I-I don't, I can't get away with stuff like that. I-I-It sounded sexy in my head, so I...

Phoebe: No, no, it's not that. (they go sit on the couch) Uhm... Remember when you asked me if I was seeing someone and I said no? Well, uhm... I am. His ... his name is Mike.

David: Oh... oh...

Phoebe: Yeah, I should have told you.

David: No... well, yeah.

Phoebe: I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

David: Well, i-it's okay. I-I-I understand... Well, s... well, are you happy with this guy?

Phoebe: I am happy.

David: Damn it! I-I'm sorry. I-I don't mean that. I-I want you to be happy... But only with me. No, uhm... that's not fair. Uh, who cares, leave him!. Oh, I don't mean that. Yes I do... I'm sorry Uhm, I... I think I should probably uhm... go...

Phoebe: Well... but David, just... I just want you to know that... that... you know... telling you this... is one of the hardest things I've ever had to do.

David: Well... just so you know... hearing it wasn't exactly a Vladnik carnival either... Can we at least hug goodbye?

Phoebe: Of course, yeah.(they hug and Phoebe sighs... a little after that also David sighs and makes his way to the door) You know, a kiss on the cheek wouldn't be totally inappropriate...

David: No... no...

Phoebe: I mean... (David kisses Phoebe on the cheek, makes his way to the door and turns around again)

David: In Minsk...

Phoebe: Yeah?

David: ...it's uhm... i-it's two on each cheek and uhm... and one on the lips.

Phoebe: Well, if that's what they do in Minsk... (They kiss 2 on each cheek... and then they pause... David turns to the door) In New York... it's... (and then David grabs her by her neck and kisses her full on the lips... They kiss passionately and cannot seem to stop.)

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Rachel and Sandy sit on the couch. Sandy holds Emma. Ross enters the apartment. Sandy and Rachel wipe their tears away with handkerchiefs]

Rachel: (in a tearful voice) Oh... Oh boy... (she turns around and sees Ross) Hi...

Ross: (very worried) Is everything allright?

Rachel: Oh yeah, it's fine, it's fine. Sandy was just... was just telling me about how he proposed to his fiancÃ©e and it was just sooo beautiful.

Sandy: Well, her favourite flower is the camellia. From the poem...

Rachel: I can't... I can't hear it again.

Sandy: You know, I can't tell it again... (wipes his tears again)

Ross: And I'm fine never having heard it... (Rachel looks at Ross in a "why do you say that" manner) Rach, can I... can I see you for a sec?

Rachel: Yeah! (to Sandy) Excuse me... (She walks to the kitchen with Ross and sighs)

Ross: Do you realise that man has cried in our apartment three times...? Huh? I haven't cried that many times since I moved in.

Rachel: Look, Ross, he's just... Sandy is just sensitive, that's all.

Ross: (picks up a cookie) Okay, okay, see... that... that is the problem. He is too sensitive. (takes a bite from the cookie)

Rachel: What...? Too sensitive to take care of our baby?

Ross: (speaking with his mouth full) Yeah, I mean, all things that guy... (looks at the cookie) These are amazing!

Rachel: Sandy made Madeleines.

Ross: This... this is exactly what I'm talking about. What kind of a guy makes... makes... delicate French cookies, huh? They're not even... butch, manly cookies with... with... you know with... with chunks. (takes a careful bite from the cookie)

Rachel: Well, I... you know, I-I-I don't know what to say... I mean, I never thought of you as a guy who needed his men to be men. You know, 'cause I gotta tell you Ross, it not like you just came in from branding cattle.

Ross: Hey... there's sensitive... and there is too sensitive.

Rachel: Okay, what? What is too sensitive? (There's music coming from the living room. Ross opens the door to the living room and he and Rachel see Sandy play a song for Emma on his recorder. Rachel is moved by this, but Ross only sees his point proven again, and walks back into the kitchen, angrily. The door he was holding, swings back and hits Rachel.)

[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. She and David are still kissing each other in the living room.]

Phoebe: Hmmm... No, no... No, I can't do this. It's bad.

David: But... I-I-It's nice... A-a-and... nice is good. A-a-and good is not bad, ergo, w-w-we should keep kissing.

Phoebe: No, no. No.

David: But... ergo...

Phoebe: Look David, if... if you had never left, then... yeah, we'd probably still be together right now, but... you did leave, and I-I'm with Mike and I really care about him...

David: Uhm... uhm... Goodbye... Uh... Schto ya ztez vigul... ui... (David holds his hands gently on the back of Phoebe's neck. There's a sound of a a bunch of keys rattling, and the door opens... It's Mike)

Mike: Well... hey, the key works...! (he looks as if he doesn't want to believe what's happening)

Phoebe: (points to David) And you thanks for the face massage. Thank you.

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica is in the kitchen and Ross enters.]

Ross: Did Rachel tell you we hired a male nanny?

Monica: Yeah! I think that's great!

Ross: Oh really? Did she tell you he plays the recorder, recites poetry and bakes Madeleines?

Monica: Oh... How are they?

Ross: (looks like in heaven) Lighter than air... (changes back to serious) But that's not the point. (Joey now also enters)

Joey: Hey!

Ross: Hey...! Rachel and I hired a male nanny.

Joey: (looks surprised) Really...? Guys do that...? That's... weird...

Ross: Thank you!

Joey: That's like a woman wanting to be a...

Ross: ...a what? A what? What's the end of that sentence?

Monica: Yes... What is the end of that sentence?

Joey: Uhm... A penis model. (Monica can't believe what's she's hearing and Ross pats Joey on the back.) Anyway, hey... Did you tell Chandler that some guy from work is the funniest guy you've ever met?

Monica: Yeah, so?

Ross: Wow!

Joey: Really? Do you not know Chandler?

Monica: Is that why he's acting so weird...? He's jealous...? Oh my God, that is crazy. It's not like I'm attracted to Geoffrey...

Joey: So what? Being funny is Chandler's thing... You know, like Ross's thing is... (he can't come up with anything)

Ross: Science...? Academia...? Being a good father...?

Joey: ...No... (he just can't seem to grasp it)

Monica: I can't believe he's that upset about this...

Joey: Monica, you have to do some damage control here, okay. 'Cause he's feeling like... (the door opens and Chandler walks in with a pizza)

Chandler: Hey!

Joey: Heeeyy! Hey!

Chandler: What are you guys talking about?

Ross: Uhm... Rachel and I hired a male nanny. (Joey makes a gesture and sound like "Can you believe that?")

Chandler: You got a man who's a nanny...? You got a manny...? (Monica starts laughing, but very exaggerated. Joey realises they also should laugh and punches Ross. Now all three of them laugh, but very fake. Chandler seems happy again.)

Chandler: You know, I don't mind a... male nanny, but I do draw the line at a male wetnurse. (again they laugh, even more fake than before)

Monica: Ohhh, ooohhh... you are on a roll, mister!

Chandler: If I'd known you guys were coming over, I would have brought more pizza. (they all burst out in a thundering laugh)

Monica: Okay, okay... Chandler you... you stop it! (Monica wipes away tears)

Chandler: What is so funny about that? (they realise it wasn't a joke)

Monica: Well, I don't know... I-It's... just the way you say it... I mean, you're funny... You have that funny thing. You're a funny guy! (Chandler turns to Joey)

Chandler: Did you tell her what we talked about? (Joey starts laughing hysterically, but then gets serious again...)

Joey: Yeah....

Chandler: So those were pity laughs? PITY LAUGHS? (Joey and Ross walk away from the kitchen)

Monica: Honey, listen... You have nothing to worry about with Geoffrey.

Chandler: Oh yeah? Is he funnier than me?

Monica: Well, you're... you're different funny... I mean, you're... you're more sarcastic a-a-and... well, he does... bits... and impressions... and... and limericks...

Chandler: I do limericks... uhm... There once was a man named Chandler, whose wife made him die inside.

Monica: Honey, you know I think you're hilarious! Come on, you know that joke you told me last week? The one about Jerry Lewis and the girl with the lazy eye...? (he laughs) That slayed me.

Ross: Hey... I made up that joke and told it to you! (He points at Chandler. Joey gestures to Ross "What are you doing?)

Joey: Not knowing when to shut up...

Ross: Yep! That's my thing...

[Scene: Phoebe's apartment. David is still there. Mike closes the door.]

Mike: So... how many guys have your key?

Phoebe: No, no, no, no, no... It's not... it's not... i'ts not as bad as it looks... really. I was just saying goodbye to an old friend.

Mike: Your lipstick's on his mouth.

David: Oh, uh... we just uh... happen to wear the same shade.

[Scene: Ross walks in the hallway to his apartment and stops in front of his own door. Now he hears two recorders playing a song. When he enters, Sandy and Joey are playing the recorder and Rachel listens.]

Joey: Yeah! Allright! Hey, hey Ross. Check it out! Sandy taught me Hot-cross Buns.

Ross: Really? Sounded like Three Blind Mice.

Joey: Noooo... Three Blind Mice goes like this... (he puts his fingers in position on the recorder)

Ross: (looks angrily at Joey and points at him) I swear to God...! (Joey is in shock)

Joey: Me! I'm up for puppets!

Sandy: Well, please welcome... The Snufflebumps... Who wants to be mr. Wigglemunch and who's gonna be the Grumpus?

Ross: Okay, okay... How exactly is a two month old supposed to appreciate puppets?

Sandy: Actually studies have shown that the movement and colours help their cerebral development... The whimsical characters are just for us. (He winks to Joey and Rachel. Ross's face says he disapproves. Joey sees that and kind of angrily says...)

Joey: I wanna be mr. Wigglemunch. (and makes a "there" nod to Ross)

Ross: (shakes his head) Oh my God!

Sandy: Well, I guess we know who's gonna be the Grumpus... (Ross goes to the kitchen)

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's kitchen. Ross got a beer from the refrigerator and opens the bottle. Rachel now also enters the kitchen.]

Rachel: That was kind of rude!

Ross: Oh, I'm sorry. Please apologise to Sandy and the Snufflebumps for me.

Rachel: You know, he was just doing his job...

Ross: Well, you know what... I-I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't in love with Gary Poppins out there... But I just... I can't... I can't go through with this.

Rachel: Oh, come on Ross...

Ross: No! Hey, you know what? I'm sorry. I would never force you... to hire someone you were this uncomfortable with...

Rachel: (sighs) Oh... That's true.

Ross: Thank you!

Rachel: Well, you're the one who wants to fire him, so you're gonna have to do it. (Ross walks to the living room determined to fire Sandy)

[Scene: Living room. Joey and Sandy are talking with the Snufflebumps.]

Sandy: (In a puppet voice) So you see Wigglemunch, that's why it's important to shaaaaaaare...

[Scene: Monica and Chandler's apartment. Monica and Joey are sitting at the dinner table. Chandler comes from the bedroom with his suitcase.]

Chandler: Well, I'm off to Tulsa, so if your Maitre D. friend has any funny Oklahoma jokes, tell him to e-mail me at www.hahanotsomuch.com.

Monica: Honey, you can relax. Last night at work, Geoffrey told this really sexist joke. After that, not so funny anymore.

Chandler: Really...? See... that's the thing: you gotta keep it smart, people!

Monica: Okay, don't miss that flight. You know I love you.

Chandler: I love you too. (Monica and Chandler kiss. He turns to Joey.) And... I like you as a friend. (They hug and pat each other on the back.)

Joey: Allright. See you later!

Chandler: See ya! (he leaves the apartment)

Monica: Naaaa... He still kills me. Last night he had me laughing so hard, I swear... a little pee came out.

[Scene: Ross and Rachel's apartment. Sandy is knitting baby clothes. Ross and Rachel walk into the living room.]

Rachel: I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo. (Ross walks to the couch where Sandy sits)

Ross: Sandy... Hi, we uhm... we kinda need to talk. I'm afraid it's not working out.

Sandy: (surprised) Oh...

Ross: Yeah, uhm... I mean, Rachel and I, think you are great... with Emma... uhm... We just feel...

Rachel: (from behind the bedroom door) YOU! You feel!

Ross: I... just feel that the... the chemistry isn't right. I'm sorry. We're... we're more than happy to give you good recommendation...

Sandy: Oh, no, no, no... That's okay. I got a lot of offers from other families. I just picked you guys because... I liked you the best.

Rachel: (from bedroom) Oh, damn you Geller!

Ross: Anyway, uhm...Well, I'm glad there's no hard feelings.

Sandy: No, none at all. You need to be happy with whoever is in your home... Although if you don't mind telling me, what was your problem? Maybe it's something I can work on in the future.

Ross: No, you know, it's uhm... nothing you did, it's... it's uhm... my issue.

Sandy: What is it...? (Ross hesitates) Please...? (he tilts his head)

Ross: You know, I'm just not uhm... that comfortable with a guy who's as sensitive as you.

Sandy: That's fair... Although, can I ask... why do you think that is?

Ross: Why... I... I don't know. (Sandy tilts his head again) Uhm... errrr... maybe... maybe because of my father?

Sandy: hmmm... (and shakes his head)

Ross: I mean, uhm... you know when I was growing up he was kind of a tough guy... You know a-a-and as a kid I wasn't the athlete I am now.

Rachel: (from the bedroom) Huh ha ha!

Ross: I play squash...! Anyway, uhm... I uhm... I always get the feeling he thought I was too sensitive.

Sandy: That must have been hard.

Ross: It was hard... I remember... I was in my bedroom... playing with my dinosaurs... playing and learning... and my father walks in and says... he says... "What are you doing with those things? What's wrong with you, why aren't you... why aren't you outside playing like a... like a real boy?

Sandy: But you are a real boy!

Ross: I know I am! (Ross now starts to cry) ...And when it's summer, and it's hot, why can't you wear a tank top?

Sandy: It's allright! Crying is good. It lets the boo-hoos out.

Ross: Here come some more...
