this is the first line.
this is the second line.
this is the third line.
I can go on, but I don't see the point.
From 1 to 100, my favorite number is 19.

I guess this is going to make some sense.
But even if it doesn't, it's alright.
From what I can see, it is just a test file.

From now on, I'll be focusing on my plan.

I'll be learning Python, C++, a bunch of math,
and also get CFA level 1 as well.

so this is a pretty tight schedule
From tomorrow, I'll start working really hard!
