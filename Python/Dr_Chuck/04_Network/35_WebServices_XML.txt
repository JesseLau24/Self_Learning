# XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is a flexible, text-based 
# format used to encode structured data in a human-readable way. 
# It uses tags to define elements and attributes to describe data, 
# making it easy to store and transport information across 
# different systems. XML documents are hierarchical, meaning they 
# can contain nested elements. It is widely used in web services, 
# configuration files, and data interchange between systems. Its 
# primary goal is to be self-descriptive and to facilitate data 
# sharing across diverse platforms.

# what it includes:
# 1. tags: define the structure and hierarchy of the data. 
# 2. attributes provide additional details about elements. 

# Tags are enclosed in angle brackets 
# (e.g., <tag>), 

# while attributes are included within the opening tag 
# (e.g., <tag attribute="value">).

# Serialization is the process of converting data structures or 
# objects into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted, 
# such as a file or network stream. 

# Deserialization is the reverse process, where the serialized 
# data is converted back into its original data structures or 
# objects.
