1. What is a Database?
A database is an organized collection of structured information 
or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. 
Databases are designed to manage, retrieve, and store large 
amounts of data efficiently. They help users to store data in a 
way that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated.

2. What is SQL?
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It’s a standard programm
-ing language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. 
SQL provides commands to:

--Query the database to retrieve specific data.
--Insert new data.
--Update existing data.
--Delete data.
--Create and manage database schema (e.g., tables, indexes).
--Common SQL commands include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, 
  CREATE TABLE, and DROP TABLE.

3. What is SQLite?
SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database 
engine. It’s a software library that provides a relational 
database management system (RDBMS). Here are some key points:

--Serverless: SQLite doesn’t require a separate server process. 
  It runs as a part of the application and accesses the database 
  files directly.
--Self-contained: It requires minimal setup and doesn’t have 
  dependencies on other libraries.
--File-based: It stores the entire database as a single file on 
  disk, making it portable and easy to manage.
--Cross-platform: SQLite works on various operating systems, 
  including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.
--SQLite is often used for small to medium-sized applications, 
  testing, and scenarios where simplicity and ease of setup are 
  important. It’s particularly popular in mobile applications and 
  embedded systems.

Summary
Database: A system for storing and organizing data.
SQL: A language for querying and managing relational databases.
SQLite: A lightweight, file-based relational database engine that’s easy to use and integrate.
