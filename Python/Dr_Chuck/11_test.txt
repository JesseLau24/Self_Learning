this is the second line.
this is the third line.
I can go on, but I don't see the point.

I guess this is going to make some sense.
But even if it doesn't, it's alright.

I'll be learning Python, C++, a bunch of math,
and also get CFA level 1 as well.

From tomorrow, I'll start working really hard!
