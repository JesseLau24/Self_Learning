Subject: Yo, bitch, the next batch is ready, do some laundry
The stuff is ready!
X-weight: 2 tones
X-purity: blue as the sky, bitch!
X-destination: Florida
X-in charge: Me and the boys
The good thing about it is that we only need to deal with FDA, not deal
They are easier to work with.
PS: I also bought you the chicken T-shirt you mentioned.
Last time you said "The shirt looks nice!".
So, that's it. 
I am out!
